# WOLFSSL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

This page lists known vulnerabilities for the wolfSSL embedded SSL/TLS library, wolfCrypt embedded crypto engine, and other wolfSSL products. Each vulnerability is linked to the description and CVE if available. Please [contact us](https://www.wolfssl.com/contact/) with any questions or concerns.

### Known wolfSSL Vulnerabilities

The SSL/TLS protocol is documented and under constant scrutiny by the top experts in security and cryptography. SSL was quickly adopted as a standard world wide. SSL and TLS together secure communications between billions of computers, servers, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and embedded systems. The security provided by an SSL/TLS Library depends on the underlying strength of its cryptography which is used to encrypt communications.

| INFO | CVE ID | SEVERITY | DESCRIPTION | TIME TO FIX | FIXED IN VERSION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Low | When the OpenSSL compatibility layer is enabled, certificate verification behaved differently in wolfSSL than OpenSSL, in the X509\_STORE\_add\_cert() and X509\_STORE\_load\_locations() implementations. Previously, in cases where an application explicitly loaded an intermediate certificate, wolfSSL was verifying only up to that intermediate certificate, rather than verifying up to the root CA. This only affects use cases where the API is called directly, and does not affect TLS connections. Users that call the API X509\_STORE\_add\_cert() or X509\_STORE\_load\_locations() directly in their applications are recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used or to have additional sanity checks on certificates loaded into the X509\_STORE when verifying a certificate. Fixed in GitHub PR #8087. | TBD | 5.7.4 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2024-5288](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5288) | Medium | A private key blinding operation, enabled by defining the macro WOLFSSL\_BLIND\_PRIVATE\_KEY, was added to mitigate a potential row hammer attack on ECC operations. If performing ECC private key operations in an environment where a malicious user could gain fine control over the device and perform row hammer style attacks it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used and to build with WOLFSSL\_BLIND\_PRIVATE\_KEY defined. Thanks to Kemal Derya, M. Caner Tol, Berk Sunar for the report (Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute) Fixed in github pull request #7416 | 8 days | 5.7.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Low | When parsing a provided maliciously crafted certificate directly using wolfSSL API, outside of a TLS connection, a certificate with an excessively large number of extensions could lead to a potential DoS. There are existing sanity checks during a TLS handshake with wolfSSL which mitigate this issue. Thanks to Bing Shi for the report. Fixed in github pull request #7597 | 5 days | 5.7.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2024-5991](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5991) | Low | In the function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL terminated string despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically, the Openssl compatibility function X509\_check\_host() takes in a pointer and length to check against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated. While calling without a NULL terminated string is very uncommon, it is still technically allowed. If a caller was attempting to do a name check on a non\*NULL terminated buffer, the code would read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL terminator. Fixed in github pull request #7604 | 17 days | 5.7.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2024-5814](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5814) | Medium | A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection. This is because, aside from the extensions, the client was skipping fully parsing the server hello when downgrading from TLS 1.3. Fixed in github pull request #7619 | 5 days | 5.7.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Medium | OCSP stapling version 2 response verification bypass issue when a crafted response of length 0 is received. Found with internal testing. Fixed in github pull request #7702 | 12 days | 5.7.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Medium | OCSP stapling version 2 revocation bypass with a retry of a TLS connection attempt. A revoked CA certificate could incorrectly be loaded into the trusted signers list and used in a repeat connection attempt. Found with internal testing. Fixed in github pull request #7702 | 5 days | 5.7.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2024-2881](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2881) | Medium | Fault injection attack with EdDSA signature operations. This affects ed25519 sign operations where the system could be susceptible to Rowhammer attacks. Thanks to Junkai Liang, Zhi Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qingni Shen for the report (Peking University, The University of Western Australia). Fixed in this GitHub pull request #7212 | 0 days | 5.7.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2024-1545](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-1545) | Medium | Fault Injection vulnerability in RsaPrivateDecryption function that potentially allows an attacker that has access to the same system with a victims process to perform a Rowhammer fault injection. Thanks to Junkai Liang, Zhi Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qingni Shen for the report (Peking University, The University of Western Australia)." Fixed in this GitHub pull request #7167 | 9 days | 5.7.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2024-0901](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0901) | High | Potential denial of service and out of bounds read. Affects TLS 1.3 on the server side when accepting a connection from a malicious TLS 1.3 client. If using TLS 1.3 on the server side it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used. Fixed in this GitHub pull request #7099 | 5 days | 5.7.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2024-1544](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-1544) | Medium | Potential ECDSA nonce side channel attack in versions of wolfSSL before 5.6.6 with wc\_ecc\_sign\_hash calls. Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the order of the elliptic curve. Analyzing the division through a control-flow revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction methods. Thanks to Luca Wilke, Florian Sieck and Thomas Eisenbarth (University of Lübeck) for reporting the vulnerability. Details will appear in the proceedings of CCS 24. Fixed #7020 | 0 days | 5.6.6 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2023-6935](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6935) | Medium | After review of the previous RSA timing fix in wolfSSL 5.6.4, additional changes were found to be required. A complete resistant change is delivered in this release. This fix is for the Marvin attack, leading to being able to decrypt a saved TLS connection and potentially forge a signature after probing with a very large number of trial connections. This issue is around RSA decryption and affects the optional static RSA cipher suites on the server side, which are considered weak, not recommended to be used and are off by default in wolfSSL (even with –enable-all). Static RSA cipher suites were also removed from the TLS 1.3 protocol and are only present in TLS 1.2 and lower. All padding versions of RSA decrypt are affected since the code under review is outside of the padding processing. Information about the private keys is NOT compromised in affected code. It is recommended to disable static RSA cipher suites and update the version of wolfSSL used if using RSA private decryption alone outside of TLS. Thanks to Hubert Kario for the report. The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6955. | 8 days | 5.6.6 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2023-6936](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6936) | Low | A potential heap overflow read is possible in servers connecting over TLS 1.3 when the optional WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS has been defined. The out of bounds read can occur when a server receives a malicious malformed ClientHello. Users should either discontinue use of WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS on the server side or update versions of wolfSSL to 5.6.6. Thanks to the tlspuffin fuzzer team for the report which was designed and developed by; Lucca Hirschi (Inria, LORIA), Steve Kremer (Inria, LORIA), and Max Ammann (Trail of Bits). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6949. | 8 days | 5.6.6 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2024-1543](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-1543) | Low | A side channel vulnerability with AES T-Tables is possible in a very controlled environment where precision sub-cache-line inspection can happen, such as inside an Intel SGX enclave. This can lead to recovery of the AES key. To prevent this type of attack, wolfSSL added an AES bitsliced implementation which can be enabled with the “--enable-aes-bitsliced” configure option. Thanks to Florian Sieck, Zhiyuan Zhang, Sebastian Berndt, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Thomas Eisenbarth, and Yuval Yarom for the report (Universities of Lübeck, Melbourne, Adelaide and Bochum). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6854. | 11 days | 5.6.6 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2023-6937](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6937) | Low | wolfSSL prior to 5.6.6 did not check that messages in a single (D)TLS record do not span key boundaries. As a result, it was possible to combine (D)TLS messages using different keys into one (D)TLS record. The most extreme edge case is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3 record from the server containing first a ServerHello message and then the rest of the first server flight would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In (D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL client would accept an unencrypted flight from the server. This does not compromise key negotiation and authentication so it is assigned a low severity rating. Thanks to Johannes Wilson for the report (Sectra Communications and Linköping University). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7029. | 12 days | 5.6.6 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2023-3724](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-3724) | High | In previous versions of wolfSSL if a TLS 1.3 client gets neither a PSK (pre shared key) extension nor a KSE (key share extension) when connecting to a malicious server, a default predictable buffer gets used for the IKM value when generating the session master secret. Using a potentially known IKM value when generating the session master secret key compromises the key generated, allowing an eavesdropper to reconstruct it and potentially allowing surreptitious access to or meddling with message contents in the session. This issue does not affect client validation of connected servers, nor expose private key information, but could result in an insecure TLS 1.3 session when not controlling both sides of the connection. We recommend that TLS 1.3 client side users update the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Johannes from Sectra Communications and Linköping University for the report. Fixed in the following GitHub pull request #6412 | 5 days | 5.6.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Low | In cases where a malicious agent could analyze cache timing at a very detailed level, information about the AES key used could be leaked during T/S Box lookups. One such case was shown on RISC-V hardware using the MicroWalk tool (https://github.com/microwalk-project/Microwalk). A hardened version of T/S Box lookups was added in wolfSSL to help mitigate this potential attack and is now on by default with RISC-V builds and can be enabled on other builds if desired by compiling wolfSSL with the macro WOLFSSL\_AES\_TOUCH\_LINES. Thanks to Jan Wichelmann, Christopher Peredy, Florian Sieck, Anna Pätschke, Thomas Eisenbarth (University of Lübeck): MAMBO-V: Dynamic Side-Channel Leakage Analysis on RISC-V. Fixed in the following GitHub pull request #6309 | 4 days | 5.6.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-42905](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-42905) | Medium | In the case that the WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS macro is set when building wolfSSL, there is a potential heap over read of 5 bytes when handling TLS 1.3 client connections. This heap over read is limited to wolfSSL builds explicitly setting the macro WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS, the feature does not get turned on by any other build options. The macro WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS is intended for debug use only, but if having it enabled in production, users are recommended to disable WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS. Users enabling WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS are recommended to update their version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Lucca Hirschi and Steve Kremer from LORIA, Inria and Max Ammann from Trail of Bits for finding and reporting the bug with the tlspuffin tool developed partly at LORIA and Trail of Bits. | 1 day | 5.5.2 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-39173](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-39173) | Medium | Denial of service attack and buffer overflow against TLS 1.3 servers using session ticket resumption. When built with --enable-session-ticket and making use of TLS 1.3 server code in wolfSSL, there is the possibility of a malicious client to craft a malformed second ClientHello packet that causes the server to crash. This issue is limited to when using both --enable-session-ticket and TLS 1.3 on the server side. Users with TLS 1.3 servers, and having --enable-session-ticket, should update to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Max at Trail of Bits for the report, found by Lucca Hirschi from LORIA, Inria, France with the tlspuffin tool developed partly at LORIA and Trail of Bits. | 0 days | 5.5.1 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-42961](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42961) | Low | Fault injection attack on RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users doing operations with private ECC keys such as server side TLS connections and creating ECC signatures, who also have hardware that could be targeted with a sophisticated Rowhammer attack should update the version of wolfSSL and compile using the macro WOLFSSL\_CHECK\_SIG\_FAULTS. Thanks to Yarkin Doroz, Berk Sunar, Koksal Must, Caner Tol, and Kristi Rahman all affiliated with the Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report. | 5 days | 5.5.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-38153](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-38153) | Low | In wolfSSL version 5.3.0 if compiled with --enable-session-ticket and the client has non-empty session cache, with TLS 1.2 there is the possibility of a man in the middle passing a large session ticket to the client and causing a crash due to an invalid free. There is also the potential for a malicious TLS 1.3 server to crash a client in a similar manner except in TLS 1.3 it is not susceptible to a man in the middle attack. Users on the client side with –enable-session-ticket compiled in and using wolfSSL version 5.3.0 should update their version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Max at Trail of Bits for the report and "LORIA, INRIA, France" for research on tlspuffin. | 5 days | 5.5.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-38152](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-38152) | Low | If using wolfSSL\_clear to reset a WOLFSSL object (vs the normal wolfSSL\_free/wolfSSL\_new) it can result in runtime issues. This exists with builds using the wolfSSL compatibility layer (--enable-opnesslextra) and only when the application is making use of wolfSSL\_clear instead of SSL\_free/SSL\_new. In the case of a TLS 1.3 resumption, after continuing to use the WOLFSSH object after having called wolfSSL\_clear, an application could crash. It is suggested that users calling wolfSSL\_clear update the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Max at Trail of Bits for the report and "LORIA, INRIA, France" for research on tlspuffin. | 2 days | 5.5.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Medium | Potential DoS attack on DTLS 1.2. In the case of receiving a malicious plaintext handshake message at epoch 0 the connection will enter an error state reporting a duplicate message. This affects both server and client side. Users that have DTLS enabled and in use should update their version of wolfSSL to mitigate the potential for a DoS attack. | 0 days | 5.5.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-34293](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34293) | High | Potential for DTLS DoS attack. In wolfSSL versions before 5.4.0 the return-routability check is wrongly skipped in a specific edge case. The check on the return-routability is there for stopping attacks that either consume excessive resources on the server, or try to use the server as an amplifier sending an excessive amount of messages to a victim IP. If using DTLS 1.0/1.2 on the server side users should update to avoid the potential DoS attack. | 4 days | 5.4.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Medium | Ciphertext side channel attack on ECC and DH operations. Users on systems where rogue agents can monitor memory use should update the version of wolfSSL and change private ECC keys. Thanks to Sen Deng from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) for the report. | 6 days | 5.4.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-25640](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25640) | High | A TLS v1.3 server who requires mutual authentication can be bypassed. If a malicious client does not send the certificate\_verify message a client can connect without presenting a certificate even if the server requires one. Thank you to Aina Toky Rasoamanana and Olivier Levillain of Télécom SudParis. | 11 days | 5.2.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-25638](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25638) | High | A TLS v1.3 client attempting to authenticate a TLS v1.3 server can have its certificate check bypassed. If the sig\_algo in the certificate\_verify message is different than the certificate message checking may be bypassed. Thank you to Aina Toky Rasoamanana and Olivier Levillain of Télécom SudParis. | 6 days | 5.2.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2022-23408](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23408) | High | In connections using AES-CBC or DES3 with TLS/DTLS 1.2 or 1.1 the IV being used is not random. Users using wolfSSL version 5.0.0 or 5.1.0 doing TLS/DTLS 1.2 or 1.1 connections, without AEAD only, should update the version of wolfSSL used. | 0 days | 5.1.1 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2020-12966](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12966) [CVE-2021-46744](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-46744) | Medium | Public disclosure of a side channel vulnerability that has been fixed since wolfSSL version 5.1.0. When running on AMD there is the potential to leak private key information with ECDSA operations due to a ciphertext side channel attack. Users on AMD doing ECDSA operations with wolfSSL versions less than 5.1.0 should update their wolfSSL version used. Thanks to professor Yinqian Zhang from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), his Ph.D. student Mengyuan Li from The Ohio State University, and his M.S students Sen Deng and Yining Tang from SUStech along with other collaborators; Luca Wilke, Jan Wichelmann and Professor Thomas Eisenbarth from the University of Lubeck, Professor Shuai Wang from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Radu Teodorescu from The Ohio State University, Huibo Wang, Kang Li and Yueqiang Cheng from Baidu Security and Shoumeng Yang from Ant Financial Services Group. | Fixed 107 days prior to CVE issuance. | 5.1.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | CVE-2021-44718 | Low | Potential for DoS attack on a wolfSSL client due to processing hello packets of the incorrect side. This affects only connections using TLS v1.2 or less that have also been compromised by a man in the middle attack. Thanks to James Henderson, Mathy Vanhoef, Chris M. Stone, Sam L. Thomas, Nicolas Bailleut, and Tom Chothia (University of Birmingham, KU Leuven, ENS Rennes for the report. | 0 days | 5.1.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Low | Client side session resumption issue once the session resumption cache has been filled up. The hijacking of a session resumption has been demonstrated so far with only non verified peer connections. That is where the client is not verifying the server’s CA that it is connecting to. There is the potential though for other cases involving proxies that are verifying the server to be at risk, if using wolfSSL in a case involving proxies use wolfSSL\_get1\_session and then wolfSSL\_SESSION\_free when done where possible. If not adding in the session get/free function calls we recommend that users of wolfSSL that are resuming sessions update to the latest version (wolfSSL version 5.1.0 or later). Thanks to the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) for the report. | 6 days | 5.1.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Low | Hang with DSA signature creation when a specific q value is used in a maliciously crafted key. If a DSA key with an invalid q value of either 1 or 0 was decoded and used for creating a signature, it would result in a hang in wolfSSL. Users that are creating signatures with DSA and are using keys supplied from an outside source are affected. | 3 days | 5.0.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | N/A | Low | Issue with incorrectly validating a certificate that has multiple subject alternative names when given a name constraint. In the case where more than one subject alternative name is used in the certificate, previous versions of wolfSSL could incorrectly validate the certificate. Users verifying certificates with multiple alternative names and name constraints, are recommended to either use the certificate verify callback to check for this case or update the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Luiz Angelo Daros de Luca for the report. | 2 days | 5.0.0 |
| [LINK](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) | [CVE-2021-38597](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38597) | High | OCSP verification issue when response is for a certificate with no relation to the chain in question BUT that response contains the NoCheck extension which effectively disables ALL verification of that one cert. Users who should upgrade to 4.8.1 are TLS client users doing OCSP, TLS server users doing mutual auth with OCSP, and CertManager users doing OCSP independent of TLS.

This denial of service results from the relatively low effort of sending a ChangeCipherSpecs message versus the effort of the server to process that message. Users with TLS 1.3 servers are recommended to update to the most recent version of wolfSSL which limits the number of TLS 1.3 ChangeCipherSpecs that can be received in order to avoid this DoS attack.

| [LINK](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-4-5-0-now-available/) | N/A | High | wolfSSL versions prior to 4.5.0 may leak the private key in the case that PEM format private keys are bundled in with PEM certificates into a single file. This is due to the misclassification of certificate type versus private key type when parsing through the PEM file. To be affected, wolfSSL would need to have been built with OPENSSL\_EXTRA (--enable-opensslextra). Some build variants such as --enable-all and --enable-opensslall also turn on this code path, checking wolfssl/options.h for OPENSSL\_EXTRA will show if the macro was used with the build. If having built with the opensslextra enable option and having placed PEM certificates with PEM private keys in the same file when loading up the certificate file, then we recommend updating wolfSSL for this use case and also recommend regenerating any private keys in the file. | 1 day | 4.5.0 |

### Known wolfSSH Vulnerabilities

The SSH protocol is well documented and under constant scrutiny by the top experts in security and cryptography. SSH was quickly adopted as a standard world wide. SSH secures connections between billions of users to their shell accounts, and allows for secure file transfers between billions of computers, servers, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and embedded systems. The security provided by an SSH Library depends on the underlying strength of its cryptography which is used to encrypt communications.

# The Marvin Attack

* [Paper](#paper)
* [Q&A](#question-answer)

The Marvin Attack is a return of a 25 year old vulnerability that
allows performing RSA decryption and signing operations as an attacker
with the ability to observe only the time of the decryption operation
performed with the private key.

In 1998, Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that the error
messages given by SSL servers for errors in the PKCS #1 v1.5
padding allowed an adaptive-chosen ciphertext attack; this attack
fully breaks the confidentiality of TLS when used with RSA
encryption.
[In 2018](https://robotattack.org/),
Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky, and Craig Young have
shown 19 years later that many internet servers were still vulnerable
to slight variations of the original attack.

We show that many implementations previously thought
immune, are vulnerable to the timing variant of the same attack.

While the main venue of attack are TLS servers, the core issues
that caused its wide spread are applicable to most
asymmetric cryptographic algorithms (Diffie-Hellman, ECDSA, etc.),
not just to RSA. Lessons learned are also applicable to testing
the majority of cryptographic algorithms that can be vulnerable to
side-channel attacks, not just public key cryptography.

### What can the attackers gain?

For a vulnerable implementation the attacker is able to decrypt
RSA ciphertexts and forge signatures.

For a TLS server that defaults to RSA encryption key exchanges, that
means the attacker can record a session and decrypt it later.

For TLS hosts that use forward secure ciphersuites, the attacker
would have to perform a massively parallel attack to forge a server
signature before a client would time out during the connection attempt.
That makes the attack hard, but not impossible.

The attack is also applicable to other interfaces that perform
RSA decryption in automated manner but don't provide the attacker
ability to perform
arbitrary operations with the private key. Examples include
S/MIME, JSON web tokens, or hardware tokens (HSMs, smartcards, etc.).

### Who is affected?

We have identified the vulnerability in multiple implementations
and confirmed fixes in few of them,
but belive that most of cryptographic implementations are vulnerable
in practice.

We also found few APIs that are handling errors or numbers in a way

| --- | --- | --- |
| GNU MP | [mpz\_powm\_sec](https://gmplib.org/manual/Integer-Exponentiation) | leaks zero high order bits in result |

1. The API may be secure only if the returned data is used with a KDF that is fed also random, outside attacker's control, data, like in TLS

Finally, so far, we have verified just two implementations that
were not vulnerable
when tested in at least one environment:

| [BearSSL](https://www.bearssl.org/) 0.6 | Intel i9-12900KS @ 5.225 GHz, x86\_64, Friedman test negative (p-value=0.152, n=22.2M, k=36), 95% confidence interval for 25% trimmed mean of pairwise differences: ±466ps. |
| --- | --- |
| BoringSSL ([6 Sep 2023](https://github.com/google/boringssl/commit/be84aeed7), TLS) | Intel i9-12900KS @ 5.225 GHz, x86\_64, Friedman test negative (p-value=0.074, n=17.3M, k=36), 95% confidence interval for 45% trimmed mean of pairwise differences: ±574 ps. |
| [rustls](https://crates.io/crates/rustls) 0.21.9 (TLS) | no support for TLS\_RSA\_\* ciphersuites (inherently not vulnerable) |

Implementations not listed above have either not been tested
or have been verified as vulnerable, but the issues are still
embargoed.
We will continue updating the lists as we learn of new vulnerabilites
or once embargoes are lifted.

We have provided tools to detect the issue both on TLS server
level and help with testing on API level.

### What should I do?

If you use one of the affected implementations, you should install
the relevant updates. However we are reiterating the previous
recommendations:

#### Stop using RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption!

On the TLS level, only servers that enable RSA encryption are
affected. Most modern clients support the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie
Hellman, thus disabling ciphersuites that use RSA encryption is
the recommended way to fix this vulnerability.

Older clients will be able to use Finite Field Diffie Hellman,
which will be secure as long as server uses fresh DHE key shares
for every connection (protection against the Raccoon attack) and
well known parameters (or safe primes in general) for the general
protection against cryptologic attacks. Both of those things
are trivial to check for and verify compared to testing, let alone
fixing, the issues in the RSA key exchange.

#### I depend on this legacy mode

While cryptographic protocols and formats allow, and have defaulted
to use of the
PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, they either don't need it any more for
interoperability (like TLS), or have been updated to support
RSA-OAEP (S/MIME, JWT, etc.). If your software or hardware doesn't
allow use of RSA-OAEP, pressure the vendor to fix it.

#### I'm a developer of a cryptographic library

Our recommendation is similar: deprecate and disable support for
PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for encryption. While we do provide a way to
handle errors in a way that should be compatible with any API
and not leak the information relevant to the Bleichenbacher attack
to the calling application **we recommend against its use**.

We have had 25 years of people trying to patch this fundamentally
broken padding mode. ROBOT have shown that the far easier workaround
was implemented incorrectly by a large number of implementations.
Implementing the
Marvin workaround *correctly* is much more tricky, as it must
include actually testing it for side channel leakage.

While we focus on PKCS#1 v1.5, the vulnerability is not limited
to just that mode, any RSA padding mode can be attacked if blinding is
not implemented using side-channel free code, or conversion from
numerical representation to a byte-string is not made using
side-channel free code. You should verify that the deblinding
operation and conversion to byte-string is side-channel free also
with RSA-OAEP and RSASVE interfaces. Only when you're able to
confidently verify that they are side-channel free, we would suggest
looking into making PKCS#1 v1.5 side-channel free.

Finally, we don't believe that this is limited to RSA itself,
any implementation that uses general purpose integer implementation
(like the default mode of OpenSSL's BIGNUM, NSS's MPI,
Java's BigInteger, Python's int, Rust's apint,
Gnu MP's mpz\_t, Go's math/big Int,
etc.) will suffer from the same issues. Given that there are attacks
that exploit high order bits being zero in other algorithms, like
[Minerva](https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/) against
ECDSA and [Raccoon attack](https://raccoon-attack.com/)
against FFDH (attack against ECDH works fundamentally the same way,
it just requires higher precision of the timing side-channel),
any cryptographic implementation that depends on general purpose
integer arithmetic library will be similarly vulnerable.
See the mpn interface of GNU MP for an example of an
[interface well suited for side-channel free programming](https://gmplib.org/manual/Low_002dlevel-Functions#Low_002dlevel-functions-for-cryptography).

### How do I test for it?

We have released a
[script](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/test-bleichenbacher-timing-pregenerate.py)
for testing TLS servers as well as
[instructions](https://tlsfuzzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/timing-analysis.html)
on how to execute it.
It's very reliable (i.e. if it reports a vulnerability, there's
by default a 1 in 100 thousand chance that it's a false positive)
unless it's executed with --static-enc option, or executed
against a server that implements a Marvin workaround.

In case the server implements the Marvin workaround
(implicit rejection), you can
verify that that code is implemented correctly using either the
TLS based [test script](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/test-bleichenbacher-timing-marvin.py),
or, in case you're testing the API directly,
[a script to generate decryption inputs](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/marvin-ciphertext-generator.py).

Upon execution the script reports the
[*p*-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value)
of sign tests
and Friedman test. If they're consistently small or very small (smaller
than 10-9) then it's extremely likely that the tested
implementation is vulnerable.

For testing APIs, we've also prepared few scripts to make testing
them easier in the
[marvin-toolkit](https://github.com/tomato42/marvin-toolkit)
repo.

Please note that to *exclude* the possibility of a side channel
the test needs to report a 95% confidence interval for bootstrapped
differences of around a nanosecond and the statistical tests need
to still be negative (have *p*-values larger than
10-5). In practice that means collecting a data set
of at least few million connections.

### How do I fix it?

While we can't give general instructions, as any fixes depend on
where the leak happens and how the code is implemented, we wrote
a separate article about debugging the code with the use
of the tlsfuzzer tooling in the
[Debugging Timing Side-channel Leaks](https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2023/09/29/debugging-timing-side-channel-leaks/) article.

#### Where does the Marvin name comes from?

The previous comprehensive attack against RSA was called ROBOT.
Given the
complexity and fragility of required fixes we don't believe that this
attack will generally go away. Thus we named it after an android
that lasted till the end of the universe in
*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.

#### What are the technical details?

For the complete details, see
our [full technical
paper](marvin-attack-paper.pdf).

In technical terms, the Marvin Attack is not new, both
vulnerabilities
to timing side-channels and vulnerability of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding
in general were known already in the 1990's.
The main contribution we bring is related to how to test for side
channel timing leakage in a way that provides high accuracy,
high precision (if provided with large data set), and thus very low
false positive rate.
Additionally, because we measure the whole end-to-end operation,
by performing a complete TLS handshake,
we're able to find issues in places other than the low level numerical
calls (e.g. the GnuTLS vulnerability was in code that was making a
decision about what kind of error message to print if debugging
mode was enabled) and able to test different implementations
relatively easily and quickly.

In other words, we got results because we were thorough, not
because we used novel techniques.

#### Is there a CVE for the Marvin Attack?

No. While it is a fundamental flaw in the RSA decryption, it
has been widely known that padding errors need to be handled in
constant time. But because of the complexity of implementing it in
practice, every implementation will likely have a slightly different
bug in the code.

#### How easy is it to carry out the attack? Is it practical?

Yes. We’ve been able to execute the attack against M2Crypto and
pyca/cryptography in just a couple of hours in a normal environment
on a mid-range laptop.
Estimating the practically of attacks on TLS servers is more complex as
it critically depends on the key sizes used, CPU model of the victim,
hardware and OS configuration, the RSA implementation in question, and
how closely to the server can the attacker
co-locate the probe measuring the response times.
For an attacker that can get access to a host connected to the
same network switch as the victim, a worst case scenario (for the
victim) would
require a few days to perform the attack against a vulnerable version
of OpenSSL and couple of hours to attack NSS.

#### The test script reports a very small side-channel, does it mean I'm not vulnerable in practice?

No. While previously the general consensus was that very small
side channels, on the order of a few hundred nanoseconds, were not
considered to be exploitable, that was based on flawed testing.

All statistical tests make some assumptions about tested data.
The most common assumption is that the compared samples are
[Independent and Identically Distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables) (IID).
That assumption is also central to the Box Test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test and Mann-Whitney U test.
In practice, we haven't found that the timing data was independent,
in fact, for many tests of independence, just a few hundred
observations were sufficient to absolutely exclude that possibility.
For context, to get precise measurements we commonly need thousands to
millions of measurements, so the lack of independence will affect
large samples only more.

Since the requirements of the test were not met, it gave incorrect
results and thus incorrect
conclusions from it were drawn.

In our approach to testing, we use
[paired difference tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paired_difference_test) which require idependence of the
*differences* within pairs of measurements, not measurements
themselves. That property is much easier to achieve if we have
complete control over the executed test (in which order the individual
connections are executed), and is met for the collected data.

By using this kind of tests (sign test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
bootstrapping of the median of paired differences, etc.) we were able
to both show no false positives for very large samples in practice
(hundreds of millions of observations) and the ability to detect very
small
differences in timing, in the order of a few CPU clock cycles, even
when measuring across a production network, a few kilometers away,
and 6 router hops between
victim and attacker.

In other words, the size of the side channel affects only **how
many** observations will the attacker need to perform, **not if**
they will be able to measure the difference at all.

Also, because the paired difference tests require consistent
environment only within each pair, parallelization of the attack
is trivial.

#### Is the vulnerability currently being exploited by attackers?

While we have no reason to believe that the Marvin Atttack has been
exploited
in the wild prior to this disclosure, the original ROBOT attack did
suggest that timing variants of the vulnerability may also be possible.
Since the details of the
vulnerability are now public, attackers may start exploiting
it at any time, and we recommend taking the
countermeasures [explained above](#mitigation) as
soon as possible.

#### RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 has been known to be insecure for 25 years. What’s the big deal?

Indeed, while problems with RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding have been
known for over 25 years, and just as long we had alternatives
in form of RSA-OAEP, protocol and format designers valued backwards
compatibility over inheritent security of better options.
While protocols like S/MIME (a.k.a CMS) also date from that era,
protocols like JSON Web Tokens have been concieved well after
RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 was known to be hard to implement correctly, yet
included it anyway. We need to go to standards as new as WebCrypto
to find standards that omit this bad padding completely.

The other is complacency of implementers and protocol designers
in considering that there are side channels that are "too small to be
detectable". Best illustrated by subsequent versions of TLS, that
included more and more complex workarounds for the attacks against
ciphersuites with CBC padding and RSA key exchange, only to finally
remove them completely in TLS 1.3.

#### I don't use RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, only OAEP, does that mean I'm safe?

No. At least, not universally. Both OpenSSL and NSS bugs were in
the numerical library, not in the padding or error reporting code.
That code is shared between all padding modes, be it PKCS#1 v1.5, OAEP,
or RSASVE. As such, any decryption operation will leak the same kind
of information, and thus can be used to attack messages encrypted
with any padding method.

Only RSA-OAEP implementations that use constant-time mathematical
library (specifically, constant-time code for deblinding and
converstion of the large precision integer to a byte string),
and ignore the value of the first byte of padding will not
be vulnerable to the Marvin attack.

#### Does the Marvin Attack allow an attacker to steal the server’s private key?

No. The Marvin Attacks allows an attacker to decrypt one ciphertext
(connection) or sign a message at a
time. The attacker does not learn the server’s private
key.

#### Can the Marvin Attack be also used to perform MitM attacks?

Yes, but not easily. If the server supports RSA key exchange
and is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack
it's possible to forge a signature on an arbitrary message,
including a ServerKeyExchange in TLS 1.2 or CertificateVerify in
TLS 1.3. The difficulty is that both of those signatures include
a random value selected by a client. Thus the signature needs to be
forged before the connection times out on the client side. In practice
that means that the attacker will need to attack multiple servers
at once, all of which will need to provide quite clear timing signal.

#### Do I need to get a new certificate for my server?

Probably not. As the attacker does not learn the server’s
private key, there’s no need to obtain new certificates.
While continued use of the same key is necessary for the attacker
to be able to decrypt previous sessions, if the server doesn't
enable RSA encryption ciphersuites the attack is impossible
either way.

#### Do I need to update my browser?

Yes. While there is nothing practical that web browsers or other
client software can do to prevent the Marvin Attack on TLS servers.
The WebCrypto in Firefox does support RSA-OEAP decryption operation
that is vulnerable (CVE-2023-5388), as such you should install
Firefox 124 or Firefox ESR 115.9.0 to fix that.

#### Can I detect if someone has exploited this against me?

Possibly. If you run a server and can be certain no one
made a large number of connections that attempted RSA key exchange
to any of your
servers (for example, by examining IDS or server logs), then
you weren’t attacked. Your logs may contain a small number of
RSA key exchange connections from the Internet-wide scans or
very old clients. In best case scenario an attack requires
tens of thousands of connections per decryption.

#### My cryptographic module is FIPS certified, do I still have to take action?

Yes. FIPS certification for cryptographic modules doesn't require
robust testing of side-channel protections.
Only on Level 4 certification are *protections* against
side-channel attacks mandatory.

#### SSLLabs says I have RSA disabled. That means I’m safe, right?

Unfortunately, no. Although [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
provides an invaluable suite of security tests, right now it
only checks whether your HTTPS server directly allows RSA key exchange.
You’re just as much at risk if your site’s certificate or key
is used anywhere else on a server that does support RSA.
Common examples include SMTP, IMAP, and POP mail servers, and
secondary HTTPS servers used for specific web
applications.

#### Are you planning to release the code for your implementation of the attack?

Sort of... while we have already released the tlsfuzzer scripts
to check if a server is vulnerable or not (i.e. tool to run a single
oracle call), and a toolkit to make testing APIs easier,
we do not plan to release a complete attack script.

#### What factors contributed to the Marvin Attack?

Testing for constant-timeness is *hard*.
While there exists a
[multitude of tools](https://neuromancer.sk/article/26)
to do that, their usability is not conducive to them
being used by
[developers](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/_media/publications/pdf/2022-sp-jancar.pdf)
or [researchers](https://neuromancer.sk/article/29).

Any tool that requires code annotations to work is also
subject to user error.

The other factor is the disregard of small side-channels,
for example, in TLS 1.2 specification we read:
> This leaves a small timing channel, since MAC
> performance depends to some extent on the size of the data fragment,
> but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable, due to
> the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the
> timing signal.

[RFC5246](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246#page-24)

#### Why did this research take so long?

While indeed the first CVEs were assigned in 2020, the last major
fixes were performed in 2023. This was caused by two problems:
first is that we were struggling with false positives caused by
the timing signal generated by the *harness* (test script),
and that caused the other issue. Because of unreliable results
it was hard to pinpoint the particular cause for the timing signal
and without that, it was hard to convince upstream developers to
work on the issue. Only when we created a constant-time test
harness were we able to move forward with fixes (and that happened
in the middle of 2022).

#### I'd like to learn about side-channel attacks, do you have some example code for that?

Yes. If you'd like to see if side-channel attacks are easy
to perform against particularly vulnerable services, or
how introduction of a network between the attacker and the
victim impacts the statistical tests, or even try to implement
simple password comparison using side-channel free code,
we have published a blog post with relevant resources:
[Experiment with side-channel attacks yourself!](https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2023/10/16/experiment-with-side-channel-attacks-yourself/)

#### How is this related to previous research?

First practical timing attacks against DH, RSA, and DSA were presented
[by Paul Kocher in 1996.](https://paulkocher.com/doc/TimingAttacks.pdf).

Originally this type of attack was
[discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher in 1998](http://archiv.infsec.ethz.ch/education/fs08/secsem/bleichenbacher98.pdf).

Klima, Pokorny and Rosa
[improved the attack and discovered the bad-version oracle in 2003](https://eprint.iacr.org/2003/052).

In 2012 Romain Bardou and others [developed a much more efficient Bleichenbacher attack algorithm](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/417)
that reduces the number of needed connections.

In 2014
[Christopher Meyer and others discovered Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities in JSSE and other products](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/meyer)
and describe the first practical timing attacks.

Tibor Jager and colleagues discovered that
[it is possible to use a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher attack against TLS 1.3 and QUIC](https://www.nds.rub.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2015/08/21/Tls13QuicAttacks.pdf).

The [DROWN attack](https://drownattack.com/) is a protocol
level Bleichenbacher vulnerability in SSL version 2. The DROWN research
also contains further insights on cross-protocol scenarios.

In 2018, Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky, and Craig Young
[did show that a lot of HTTPS
hosts are still vulnerable against a slight variation of the original
Bleichenbacher attack](https://robotattack.org/).

In 2019, Eyal Ronen and others have
[shown that a
lot of cryptographic libraries can be attacked using cache timing
attacks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835216).
