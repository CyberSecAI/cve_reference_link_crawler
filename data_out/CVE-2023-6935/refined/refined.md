Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6935:

**Summary:** The vulnerability, known as the Marvin attack, is a timing side-channel attack against RSA decryption, specifically affecting the optional static RSA cipher suites on the server side in wolfSSL.

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way RSA decryption is performed, where timing differences during the decryption process can be exploited to leak information. Specifically, the implementation of RSA private exponentiation was not resistant to timing analysis which is due to a flaw in the multiply blinding invert in Mont code. This could be exploited in the padding processing which is outside of padding processing. This was a flaw in the code outside of the padding processing.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Timing Side-Channel:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to timing attacks, where the time taken to perform the RSA decryption varies depending on the input. This timing variation can be measured by an attacker.
    *   **Vulnerable RSA Decryption:** The vulnerability specifically affects RSA decryption, particularly in the context of static RSA cipher suites.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Decryption of TLS Connections:** An attacker can decrypt saved TLS connections if the server used a vulnerable RSA cipher suite.
    *   **Potential Signature Forgery:** After probing with many connections, an attacker can potentially forge a signature. However, the private key itself is not compromised.
    *   **Exploitation of Other Interfaces**: The attack also applies to other interfaces that use RSA decryption in an automated way without allowing the attacker arbitrary operations with the private key such as S/MIME, JSON web tokens and hardware tokens.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Probing:** The attack involves the attacker sending carefully crafted ciphertexts to the server and measuring the time it takes for the server to decrypt them.
    *   **Timing Analysis:** The attacker analyzes the timing data to extract information about the decrypted plaintext.
    * **Co-location**: The attacker may need to be located close to the server to perform the timing attack effectively

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs to be able to accurately measure the time it takes for the server to respond.
    *   **Knowledge of RSA and TLS:** An understanding of RSA and TLS protocols is required to craft the attack messages.
    *   **Large Number of Trial Connections**: A very large number of trial connections may be necessary.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Configurations:** The vulnerability is specific to static RSA cipher suites on the server side. These suites are considered weak, not recommended for use, and are off by default in wolfSSL. They were removed from TLS 1.3 and are only present in TLS 1.2 and lower.
*   **Mitigation:** The primary recommendation is to disable static RSA cipher suites. Users are also advised to update their version of wolfSSL if they are using RSA private decryption outside of TLS.
*   **Affected Code:** The code under review for this vulnerability is outside of the padding processing of RSA decryption.
* **Fix**: The fix includes improvements to the RSA private exponentiation, specifically multiply blinding invert in Mont.
* **Reported By**: This vulnerability was reported by Hubert Kario.
*   **Vulnerability Severity:** This vulnerability is rated as medium severity.
