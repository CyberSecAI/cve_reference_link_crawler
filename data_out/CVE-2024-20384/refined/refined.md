Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a logic error in how Network Service Group (NSG) Access Control Lists (ACLs) are populated on Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **ACL Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass configured access control list (ACL) rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Traffic Flow:** Successful exploitation allows traffic that should be blocked by the ACL to pass through the affected device.
*   **Security Policy Violation:** This bypass violates the intended security policy, potentially exposing protected assets.
*   **Severity of Impact:** The impact of exploitation is dependent on the specific assets the ACL was protecting, which is to be evaluated by customers based on their network architecture and security posture.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Network Connection:** An attacker needs to establish a network connection to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the device to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the targeted device.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco ASA and FTD software with NSG ACL enabled are vulnerable.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability, requiring a software update to fix the issue.
*   **Detection:** The advisory describes how to check if the NSG ACL feature is enabled on a device using the `show access-list | inc object-group-network-service` command on the device's CLI.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-290, which refers to "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing."
