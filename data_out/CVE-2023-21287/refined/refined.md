{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the FreeType library, specifically how it handles font size resetting during processing of font files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of font size reset within the FreeType library.",
       "Potential for memory corruption due to incorrect size reset."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing of specially crafted font files, potentially delivered via malicious web pages, MMS messages or other apps.",
      "The attack is remote, and does not require user interaction.",
      "Proximal/adjacent exploitation is also possible, indicating that the exploit could also be used on nearby devices"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious font file to be processed by the FreeType library. No special privileges are required on the target device."
