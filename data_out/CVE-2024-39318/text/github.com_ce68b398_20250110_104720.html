# DOM-based XSS in file upload widget

Moderate

[glye](/glye)
published
GHSA-qm44-wjm2-pr59
Jul 31, 2024

## Package

composer

ibexa/admin-ui
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

v4.6.\*

## Patched versions

v4.6.9

## Description

### Impact

The file upload widget is vulnerable to XSS payloads in filenames. Access permission to upload files is required. As such, in most cases only authenticated editors and administrators will have the required permission. It is not persistent, i.e. the payload is only executed during the upload. In effect, an attacker will have to trick an editor/administrator into uploading a strangely named file. The fix ensures XSS is escaped.

### Patches

See "Patched versions". Commit: [8dc413f](https://github.com/ibexa/admin-ui/commit/8dc413fad1045fcfbe65dbcb0bea8516accc4c3e)

### Workarounds

None.
