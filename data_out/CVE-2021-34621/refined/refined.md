{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-34621",
  "description": "The ProfilePress plugin for WordPress, versions 3.0 through 3.1.3, is vulnerable to unauthenticated privilege escalation. During user registration, arbitrary user metadata, including 'wp_capabilities', can be set by supplying it as an array parameter, granting the user the supplied capabilities and allowing them to set their role to administrator. Additionally, there was no validation to check if user registration was enabled, allowing registration even if disabled.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin does not properly validate user-supplied metadata during registration and profile updates, allowing the 'wp_capabilities' user meta to be modified.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of access control",
      "Insecure user registration process"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can gain administrator privileges on vulnerable sites.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious registration request with manipulated 'wp_capabilities' metadata.",
      "Sending a malicious profile update request with manipulated 'wp_capabilities' metadata."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "No authentication is needed to exploit the registration vulnerability and a user account is needed for the profile update vulnerability."
