- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ASUS RT-AC86U router does not properly handle user requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. An attacker on the local network can send specific crafted messages to the system that triggers a service disruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack results in a denial of service (DoS), causing the system to become unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker on the local network can exploit this vulnerability by sending specific messages to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router and does not require any authentication.
