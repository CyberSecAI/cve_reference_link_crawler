## Description

The tinygltf library uses the C library function wordexp() to perform file path expansion on untrusted paths that are provided from the input file. This function allows for command injection by using backticks. An attacker could craft an untrusted path input that would result in a path expansion. We recommend upgrading to 2.6.0 or past commit 52ff00a38447f06a17eab1caa2cf0730a119c751

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

If this is a security fix it should target 3.5 (and get backported to LTS after):

<https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Tools/Pull_Requests#Rebasing_a_Pull_Request>

However from what I understand we only use tinygltf for data coming the OpenXR driver, so there may be no security issue for Blender in practice as the driver can already execute arbitrary code. If so it's not strictly needed to have it in 3.5 or LTS, though maybe there are other reasons why it helps to upgrade those versions.

I was hoping someone more familiar with the OpenXR code would assess whether it constitutes a vulnerability worthy of backporting. I apologize that this is a bit of a drive-by; I noticed this only because I was surveying the use of wordexp in applications on my system, and it wasn't clear to me whether it was possible for a user to open glTF files that might have been supplied from an untrusted source or not -- I don't know where the controller models come from. Clearly it's worth fixing anyway, so no one else decides to use the broken version for a broader purpose.

Let me know if you'd like me to target this against a different branch.

I think we might as well target this at 3.5 and backport to LTS. But will leave final decision to [@JulianEisel](/JulianEisel).

If this is easy for platform maintainers to update for 3.5, I'm fine with it. Don't have a strong opinion though.

Indeed, we just use TinyGLTF to get the controller geometry from the OpenXR runtime which is installed on the system (like a driver).

It's in extern, there is no work for platform maintainers. Doesn't hurt to check on the buildbot though.

A Linux PLY test is failing but that should be unrelated.

PR looks good to me.

Package        : tinygltf
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-3008
Debian Bug     : 1019357

It was discovered that the wordexp() function of tinygltf, a library to
load/save glTF (GL Transmission Format) files was susceptible to command
execution when processing untrusted files.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.0+dfsg-3+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tinygltf packages.

| **Describe the issue**  This is a security vulnerability. The `wordexp` call here allows arbitrary code execution   [tinygltf/tiny\_gltf.h](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/0fa56e239c77cc864dc248842e8887d985cf8e3f/tiny_gltf.h#L2640)  Line 2640 in [0fa56e2](/syoyo/tinygltf/commit/0fa56e239c77cc864dc248842e8887d985cf8e3f)   |  | int ret = wordexp(quoted\_path.c\_str(), &p, 0); | | --- | --- |    when parsing a gltf file.   **To Reproduce**   * OS: Linux * Compiler, compiler version, compile options: Clang 13.0.1-6  ``` $ git clone https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf $ cd tinygltf && make all $ echo '{"images":[{"uri":"a`echo iamhere > poc`"}], "asset":{"version":""}}' > payload.gltf $ ./loader_example payload.gltf $ cat poc iamhere ```  **Expected behaviour** The `echo iamhere > poc` command should not be executed and the `poc` file is not created in the CWD.  **Additional context** This was found by OSS-Fuzz: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=49053>  One potential fix here is to pass `WRDE_NOCMD` to `wordexp` per <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/wordexp.3.html> |

| [@oliverchang](https://github.com/oliverchang) Thanks! In `ExpandFilePath`   [tinygltf/tiny\_gltf.h](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/0fa56e239c77cc864dc248842e8887d985cf8e3f/tiny_gltf.h#L1266)  Line 1266 in [0fa56e2](/syoyo/tinygltf/commit/0fa56e239c77cc864dc248842e8887d985cf8e3f)   |  | std::string ExpandFilePath(const std::string &filepath, void \*userdata); | | --- | --- |    `wordexp` is used to expand file path(i.e, expand environment variable, expand tilde(`~`) when a file path contains such symbol).   But according to glTF spec <https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#uris> , `uri` must be URI/IRI, so file(resource) path should not contain environment variables and tilde, so we need to use URI decoder/encoder instead of `ExpandFilePath`.

| Thank you very much for the amazingly fast fix [@syoyo](https://github.com/syoyo) !  Would it be possible to create a security advisory (and CVE) for this via <https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf/security/advisories> so downstream users are notified? We (Google) can also help with this if you prefer. |

| Hi [@syoyo](https://github.com/syoyo), have you had a chance to try generating an advisory for this issue? It's a crucial part of making sure users of this library are notified of vulnerabilities (and that they need to update). |

# Header only C++ tiny glTF library(loader/saver).

`TinyGLTF` is a header only C++11 glTF 2.0 <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF> library.

`TinyGLTF` uses Niels Lohmann's json library (<https://github.com/nlohmann/json>), so now it requires C++11 compiler.
(Also, you can use RadpidJSON as an JSON backend)
If you are looking for old, C++03 version, please use `devel-picojson` branch (but not maintained anymore).

## Status

Currently TinyGLTF is stable and maintenance mode. No drastic changes and feature additions planned.

* v2.9.0 Various fixes and improvements. Filesystem callback API change.
* v2.8.0 Add URICallbacks for custom URI handling in Buffer and Image. PR#397
* v2.7.0 Change WriteImageDataFunction user callback function signature. PR#393
* v2.6.0 Support serializing sparse accessor(Thanks to @fynv).
* v2.5.0 Add SetPreserveImageChannels() option to load image data as is.
* v2.4.0 Experimental RapidJSON support. Experimental C++14 support(C++14 may give better performance)
* v2.3.0 Modified Material representation according to glTF 2.0 schema(and introduced TextureInfo class)
* v2.2.0 release(Support loading 16bit PNG. Sparse accessor support)
* v2.1.0 release(Draco decoding support)
* v2.0.0 release(22 Aug, 2018)!

### Branches

* `sajson` : Use sajson to parse JSON. Parsing only but faster compile time(2x reduction compared to json.hpp and RapidJson), but not well maintained.

## Builds

[![Build status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/123cd0abcdaf55e53ae1a0c5ffa85dec431d488f7e08b20b369002c8ccd77b6e/68747470733a2f2f63692e6170707665796f722e636f6d2f6170692f70726f6a656374732f7374617475732f7761726e67656e7539776a6a686c6d383f7376673d74727565)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/syoyo/tinygltf)

## Features

Probably mostly feature-complete. Last missing feature is Draco encoding: [#207](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf/issues/207)

* Written in portable C++. C++-11 with STL dependency only.
  + macOS + clang(LLVM)
  + iOS + clang
  + Linux + gcc/clang
  + Windows + MinGW
  + Windows + Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or later.
    - Visual Studio 2013 is not supported since they have limited C++11 support and failed to compile `json.hpp`.
  + Android NDK
  + Android + CrystaX(NDK drop-in replacement) GCC
  + Web using Emscripten(LLVM)
* Moderate parsing time and memory consumption.
* glTF specification v2.0.0
  + ASCII glTF
    - Load
    - Save
  + Binary glTF(GLB)
    - Load
    - Save(.bin embedded .glb)
* Buffers
  + Parse BASE64 encoded embedded buffer data(DataURI).
  + Load `.bin` file.
* Image(Using stb\_image)
  + Parse BASE64 encoded embedded image data(DataURI).
  + Load external image file.
  + Load PNG(8bit and 16bit)
  + Load JPEG(8bit only)
  + Load BMP
  + Load GIF
  + Custom Image decoder callback(e.g. for decoding OpenEXR image)
* Morph traget
  + Sparse accessor
* Load glTF from memory
* Custom callback handler
  + Image load
  + Image save
* Extensions
  + Draco mesh decoding
  + Draco mesh encoding

## Note on extension property

In extension(`ExtensionMap`), JSON number value is parsed as int or float(number) and stored as `tinygltf::Value` object. If you want a floating point value from `tinygltf::Value`, use `GetNumberAsDouble()` method.

`IsNumber()` returns true if the underlying value is an int value or a floating point value.

## Examples

* [glview](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/examples/glview) : Simple glTF geometry viewer.
* [validator](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/examples/validator) : Simple glTF validator with JSON schema.
* [basic](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/examples/basic) : Basic glTF viewer with texturing support.
* [build-gltf](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/examples/build-gltf) : Build simple glTF scene from a scratch.

### WASI/WASM build

Users who want to run TinyGLTF securely and safely(e.g. need to handle malcious glTF file to serve online glTF conver),
I recommend to build TinyGLTF for WASM target.
WASI build example is located in [wasm](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/wasm) .

## Projects using TinyGLTF

## TODOs

* Robust URI decoding/encoding. [#369](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf/issues/369)
* Mesh Compression/decompression(Open3DGC, etc)
  + Load Draco compressed mesh
  + Save Draco compressed mesh
  + Open3DGC?
* Support `extensions` and `extras` property
* HDR image?
  + OpenEXR extension through TinyEXR.
* 16bit PNG support in Serialization
* Write example and tests for `animation` and `skin`

### Optional

* Write C++ code generator which emits C++ code from JSON schema for robust parsing?

## Licenses

TinyGLTF is licensed under MIT license.

TinyGLTF uses the following third party libraries.

* json.hpp : Copyright (c) 2013-2017 Niels Lohmann. MIT license.
* base64 : Copyright (C) 2004-2008 René Nyffenegger
* stb\_image.h : v2.08 - public domain image loader - [Github link](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
* stb\_image\_write.h : v1.09 - public domain image writer - [Github link](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_write.h)

## Build and example

Copy `stb_image.h`, `stb_image_write.h`, `json.hpp` and `tiny_gltf.h` to your project.

### Loading glTF 2.0 model

```
// Define these only in *one* .cc file.
#define TINYGLTF_IMPLEMENTATION
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#define STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION
// #define TINYGLTF_NOEXCEPTION // optional. disable exception handling.
#include "tiny_gltf.h"

using namespace tinygltf;

Model model;
TinyGLTF loader;
std::string err;
std::string warn;

bool ret = loader.LoadASCIIFromFile(&model, &err, &warn, argv[1]);
//bool ret = loader.LoadBinaryFromFile(&model, &err, &warn, argv[1]); // for binary glTF(.glb)

if (!warn.empty()) {
  printf("Warn: %s\n", warn.c_str());
}

if (!err.empty()) {
  printf("Err: %s\n", err.c_str());
}

if (!ret) {
  printf("Failed to parse glTF\n");
  return -1;
}
```

#### Loader options

* `TinyGLTF::SetPreserveimageChannels(bool onoff)`. `true` to preserve image channels as stored in image file for loaded image. `false` by default for backward compatibility(image channels are widen to `RGBA` 4 channels). Effective only when using builtin image loader(STB image loader).

## Compile options

* `TINYGLTF_NOEXCEPTION` : Disable C++ exception in JSON parsing. You can use `-fno-exceptions` or by defining the symbol `JSON_NOEXCEPTION` and `TINYGLTF_NOEXCEPTION` to fully remove C++ exception codes when compiling TinyGLTF.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_STB_IMAGE` : Do not load images with stb\_image. Instead use `TinyGLTF::SetImageLoader(LoadimageDataFunction LoadImageData, void *user_data)` to set a callback for loading images.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_STB_IMAGE_WRITE` : Do not write images with stb\_image\_write. Instead use `TinyGLTF::SetImageWriter(WriteimageDataFunction WriteImageData, void *user_data)` to set a callback for writing images.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_EXTERNAL_IMAGE` : Do not try to load external image file. This option would be helpful if you do not want to load image files during glTF parsing.
* `TINYGLTF_ANDROID_LOAD_FROM_ASSETS`: Load all files from packaged app assets instead of the regular file system. **Note:** You must pass a valid asset manager from your android app to `tinygltf::asset_manager` beforehand.
* `TINYGLTF_ENABLE_DRACO`: Enable Draco compression. User must provide include path and link correspnding libraries in your project file.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_INCLUDE_JSON` : Disable including `json.hpp` from within `tiny_gltf.h` because it has been already included before or you want to include it using custom path before including `tiny_gltf.h`.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_INCLUDE_RAPIDJSON` : Disable including RapidJson's header files from within `tiny_gltf.h` because it has been already included before or you want to include it using custom path before including `tiny_gltf.h`.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE` : Disable including `stb_image.h` from within `tiny_gltf.h` because it has been already included before or you want to include it using custom path before including `tiny_gltf.h`.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE_WRITE` : Disable including `stb_image_write.h` from within `tiny_gltf.h` because it has been already included before or you want to include it using custom path before including `tiny_gltf.h`.
* `TINYGLTF_USE_RAPIDJSON` : Use RapidJSON as a JSON parser/serializer. RapidJSON files are not included in TinyGLTF repo. Please set an include path to RapidJSON if you enable this feature.
* `TINYGLTF_USE_CPP14` : Use C++14 feature(requires C++14 compiler). This may give better performance than C++11.

## CMake options

You can add tinygltf using `add_subdirectory` feature.
If you add tinygltf to your project using `add_subdirectory`, it would be better to set `TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY` on(just add an include path to tinygltf) and `TINYGLTF_INSTALL` off(Which does not install tinygltf files).

```
// Your project's CMakeLists.txt
...

set(TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY ON CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(TINYGLTF_INSTALL OFF CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(/path/to/tinygltf)

```

NOTE: Using tinygltf as a submodule doesn't automatically add the headers to your include path (as standard for many libraries). To get this functionality, add the following to the CMakeLists.txt file from above:

```
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE "/path/to/tinygltf")

```

### Saving gltTF 2.0 model

* Buffers.
  + To file
  + Embedded
  + Draco compressed?
* Images
  + To file
  + Embedded
* Binary(.glb)
  + .bin embedded single .glb
  + External .bin

## Running tests.

### glTF parsing test

#### Setup

Python required.
Git clone <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models> to your local dir.

#### Run parsing test

After building `loader_example`, edit `test_runner.py`, then,

```
$ python test_runner.py
```

### Unit tests

```
$ cd tests
$ make
$ ./tester
$ ./tester_noexcept
```

### Fuzzing tests

See `tests/fuzzer` for details.

After running fuzzer on Ryzen9 3950X a week, at least `LoadASCIIFromString` looks safe except for out-of-memory error in Fuzzer.
We may be better to introduce bounded memory size checking when parsing glTF data.
