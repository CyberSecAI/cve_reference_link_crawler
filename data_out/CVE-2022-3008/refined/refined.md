  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The tinygltf library uses the C library function `wordexp()` to perform file path expansion on untrusted paths provided from the input file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection: The `wordexp()` function allows command injection by using backticks within the file path. An attacker can craft a malicious file path that, when expanded by `wordexp()`, executes arbitrary commands."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system by crafting a malicious glTF file containing a specially crafted file path.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious glTF file: An attacker provides a crafted glTF file containing a malicious file path to be processed by the tinygltf library."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious glTF file that is then processed by a vulnerable application using the tinygltf library."
