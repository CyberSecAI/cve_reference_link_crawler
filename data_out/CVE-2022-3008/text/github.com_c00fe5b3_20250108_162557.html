## Description

The tinygltf library uses the C library function wordexp() to perform file path expansion on untrusted paths that are provided from the input file. This function allows for command injection by using backticks. An attacker could craft an untrusted path input that would result in a path expansion. We recommend upgrading to 2.6.0 or past commit 52ff00a38447f06a17eab1caa2cf0730a119c751

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
