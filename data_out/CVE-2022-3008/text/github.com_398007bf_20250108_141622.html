# Header only C++ tiny glTF library(loader/saver).

`TinyGLTF` is a header only C++11 glTF 2.0 <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF> library.

`TinyGLTF` uses Niels Lohmann's json library (<https://github.com/nlohmann/json>), so now it requires C++11 compiler.
(Also, you can use RadpidJSON as an JSON backend)
If you are looking for old, C++03 version, please use `devel-picojson` branch (but not maintained anymore).

## Status

Currently TinyGLTF is stable and maintenance mode. No drastic changes and feature additions planned.

* v2.9.0 Various fixes and improvements. Filesystem callback API change.
* v2.8.0 Add URICallbacks for custom URI handling in Buffer and Image. PR#397
* v2.7.0 Change WriteImageDataFunction user callback function signature. PR#393
* v2.6.0 Support serializing sparse accessor(Thanks to @fynv).
* v2.5.0 Add SetPreserveImageChannels() option to load image data as is.
* v2.4.0 Experimental RapidJSON support. Experimental C++14 support(C++14 may give better performance)
* v2.3.0 Modified Material representation according to glTF 2.0 schema(and introduced TextureInfo class)
* v2.2.0 release(Support loading 16bit PNG. Sparse accessor support)
* v2.1.0 release(Draco decoding support)
* v2.0.0 release(22 Aug, 2018)!

### Branches

* `sajson` : Use sajson to parse JSON. Parsing only but faster compile time(2x reduction compared to json.hpp and RapidJson), but not well maintained.

## Builds

[![Build status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/123cd0abcdaf55e53ae1a0c5ffa85dec431d488f7e08b20b369002c8ccd77b6e/68747470733a2f2f63692e6170707665796f722e636f6d2f6170692f70726f6a656374732f7374617475732f7761726e67656e7539776a6a686c6d383f7376673d74727565)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/syoyo/tinygltf)

[![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf/workflows/C/C%2B%2B%20CI/badge.svg)

## Features

Probably mostly feature-complete. Last missing feature is Draco encoding: [#207](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf/issues/207)

* Written in portable C++. C++-11 with STL dependency only.
  + macOS + clang(LLVM)
  + iOS + clang
  + Linux + gcc/clang
  + Windows + MinGW
  + Windows + Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or later.
    - Visual Studio 2013 is not supported since they have limited C++11 support and failed to compile `json.hpp`.
  + Android NDK
  + Android + CrystaX(NDK drop-in replacement) GCC
  + Web using Emscripten(LLVM)
* Moderate parsing time and memory consumption.
* glTF specification v2.0.0
  + ASCII glTF
    - Load
    - Save
  + Binary glTF(GLB)
    - Load
    - Save(.bin embedded .glb)
* Buffers
  + Parse BASE64 encoded embedded buffer data(DataURI).
  + Load `.bin` file.
* Image(Using stb\_image)
  + Parse BASE64 encoded embedded image data(DataURI).
  + Load external image file.
  + Load PNG(8bit and 16bit)
  + Load JPEG(8bit only)
  + Load BMP
  + Load GIF
  + Custom Image decoder callback(e.g. for decoding OpenEXR image)
* Morph traget
  + Sparse accessor
* Load glTF from memory
* Custom callback handler
  + Image load
  + Image save
* Extensions
  + Draco mesh decoding
  + Draco mesh encoding

## Note on extension property

In extension(`ExtensionMap`), JSON number value is parsed as int or float(number) and stored as `tinygltf::Value` object. If you want a floating point value from `tinygltf::Value`, use `GetNumberAsDouble()` method.

`IsNumber()` returns true if the underlying value is an int value or a floating point value.

## Examples

* [glview](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/examples/glview) : Simple glTF geometry viewer.
* [validator](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/examples/validator) : Simple glTF validator with JSON schema.
* [basic](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/examples/basic) : Basic glTF viewer with texturing support.
* [build-gltf](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/examples/build-gltf) : Build simple glTF scene from a scratch.

### WASI/WASM build

Users who want to run TinyGLTF securely and safely(e.g. need to handle malcious glTF file to serve online glTF conver),
I recommend to build TinyGLTF for WASM target.
WASI build example is located in [wasm](/syoyo/tinygltf/blob/release/wasm) .

## Licenses

TinyGLTF is licensed under MIT license.

TinyGLTF uses the following third party libraries.

* json.hpp : Copyright (c) 2013-2017 Niels Lohmann. MIT license.
* base64 : Copyright (C) 2004-2008 René Nyffenegger
* stb\_image.h : v2.08 - public domain image loader - [Github link](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
* stb\_image\_write.h : v1.09 - public domain image writer - [Github link](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_write.h)

## Build and example

Copy `stb_image.h`, `stb_image_write.h`, `json.hpp` and `tiny_gltf.h` to your project.

### Loading glTF 2.0 model

```
// Define these only in *one* .cc file.
#define TINYGLTF_IMPLEMENTATION
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#define STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION
// #define TINYGLTF_NOEXCEPTION // optional. disable exception handling.
#include "tiny_gltf.h"

using namespace tinygltf;

Model model;
TinyGLTF loader;
std::string err;
std::string warn;

bool ret = loader.LoadASCIIFromFile(&model, &err, &warn, argv[1]);
//bool ret = loader.LoadBinaryFromFile(&model, &err, &warn, argv[1]); // for binary glTF(.glb)

if (!warn.empty()) {
  printf("Warn: %s\n", warn.c_str());
}

if (!err.empty()) {
  printf("Err: %s\n", err.c_str());
}

if (!ret) {
  printf("Failed to parse glTF\n");
  return -1;
}
```

#### Loader options

* `TinyGLTF::SetPreserveimageChannels(bool onoff)`. `true` to preserve image channels as stored in image file for loaded image. `false` by default for backward compatibility(image channels are widen to `RGBA` 4 channels). Effective only when using builtin image loader(STB image loader).

## Compile options

* `TINYGLTF_NOEXCEPTION` : Disable C++ exception in JSON parsing. You can use `-fno-exceptions` or by defining the symbol `JSON_NOEXCEPTION` and `TINYGLTF_NOEXCEPTION` to fully remove C++ exception codes when compiling TinyGLTF.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_STB_IMAGE` : Do not load images with stb\_image. Instead use `TinyGLTF::SetImageLoader(LoadimageDataFunction LoadImageData, void *user_data)` to set a callback for loading images.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_STB_IMAGE_WRITE` : Do not write images with stb\_image\_write. Instead use `TinyGLTF::SetImageWriter(WriteimageDataFunction WriteImageData, void *user_data)` to set a callback for writing images.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_EXTERNAL_IMAGE` : Do not try to load external image file. This option would be helpful if you do not want to load image files during glTF parsing.
* `TINYGLTF_ANDROID_LOAD_FROM_ASSETS`: Load all files from packaged app assets instead of the regular file system. **Note:** You must pass a valid asset manager from your android app to `tinygltf::asset_manager` beforehand.
* `TINYGLTF_ENABLE_DRACO`: Enable Draco compression. User must provide include path and link correspnding libraries in your project file.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_INCLUDE_JSON` : Disable including `json.hpp` from within `tiny_gltf.h` because it has been already included before or you want to include it using custom path before including `tiny_gltf.h`.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_INCLUDE_RAPIDJSON` : Disable including RapidJson's header files from within `tiny_gltf.h` because it has been already included before or you want to include it using custom path before including `tiny_gltf.h`.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE` : Disable including `stb_image.h` from within `tiny_gltf.h` because it has been already included before or you want to include it using custom path before including `tiny_gltf.h`.
* `TINYGLTF_NO_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE_WRITE` : Disable including `stb_image_write.h` from within `tiny_gltf.h` because it has been already included before or you want to include it using custom path before including `tiny_gltf.h`.
* `TINYGLTF_USE_RAPIDJSON` : Use RapidJSON as a JSON parser/serializer. RapidJSON files are not included in TinyGLTF repo. Please set an include path to RapidJSON if you enable this feature.
* `TINYGLTF_USE_CPP14` : Use C++14 feature(requires C++14 compiler). This may give better performance than C++11.

## CMake options

You can add tinygltf using `add_subdirectory` feature.
If you add tinygltf to your project using `add_subdirectory`, it would be better to set `TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY` on(just add an include path to tinygltf) and `TINYGLTF_INSTALL` off(Which does not install tinygltf files).

```
// Your project's CMakeLists.txt
...

set(TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY ON CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(TINYGLTF_INSTALL OFF CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(/path/to/tinygltf)

```

NOTE: Using tinygltf as a submodule doesn't automatically add the headers to your include path (as standard for many libraries). To get this functionality, add the following to the CMakeLists.txt file from above:

```
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE "/path/to/tinygltf")

```

### Saving gltTF 2.0 model

* Buffers.
  + To file
  + Embedded
  + Draco compressed?
* Images
  + To file
  + Embedded
* Binary(.glb)
  + .bin embedded single .glb
  + External .bin

## Running tests.

### glTF parsing test

#### Setup

Python required.
Git clone <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models> to your local dir.

#### Run parsing test

After building `loader_example`, edit `test_runner.py`, then,

```
$ python test_runner.py
```

### Unit tests

```
$ cd tests
$ make
$ ./tester
$ ./tester_noexcept
```

### Fuzzing tests

See `tests/fuzzer` for details.

After running fuzzer on Ryzen9 3950X a week, at least `LoadASCIIFromString` looks safe except for out-of-memory error in Fuzzer.
We may be better to introduce bounded memory size checking when parsing glTF data.
