Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Master Addons for Elementor" plugin. Specifically, the Pricing Table widget within the plugin does not properly handle user-supplied input, which allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are saved within the plugin's database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
- Improper Input Sanitization: The plugin fails to sanitize user input when creating or modifying a pricing table.
- Inadequate Output Escaping: The plugin doesn't properly escape user-controlled data when rendering the pricing table, resulting in the execution of injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript, which can execute when a user views the page containing the compromised widget.
- Potential for Account Compromise: An attacker could use injected scripts to perform actions on behalf of a user, potentially leading to account compromise.
- Data Theft: Scripts could be injected to steal user data (e.g., session cookies, form data), or redirect users to phishing sites.
- Website Defacement: Attackers could deface the website or inject unwanted content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Pricing Table" widget in the "Master Addons for Elementor" plugin.
- An authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher can inject the malicious scripts into the widget's settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker must have a WordPress account with at least Contributor-level permissions.
- Access to Elementor Editor: The attacker needs to access the Elementor editor and the ability to modify pages using the plugin.
- Knowledge of XSS: The attacker must be familiar with XSS techniques to craft malicious JavaScript payloads.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the "Master Addons for Elementor" plugin up to and including 2.0.5.6.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.5.7
