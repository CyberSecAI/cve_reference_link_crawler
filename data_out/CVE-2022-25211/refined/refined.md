**CVE-2022-25211**

*   **Root Cause:** The SWAMP plugin does not perform a permission check in a method that implements form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions before allowing access to a specific method.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The vulnerable form validation method does not require POST requests, allowing CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted HTTP requests.
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker can trick a user into making the request by using a malicious website or email.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins to exploit the missing permission check.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into triggering the CSRF request.

**Additional Notes:**
