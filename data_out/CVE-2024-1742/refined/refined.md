- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `mk_oracle` plugin in Checkmk was calling `sqlplus` with the connection string (including credentials) as a command-line argument.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (database credentials) in the process list.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access could potentially extract database credentials by observing process command-line arguments using tools like `ps`.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system where the Checkmk agent is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the Checkmk agent is running and have the ability to view process information.

This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes the specific vulnerable component (`mk_oracle` plugin), the exact method of credential exposure (command-line arguments to `sqlplus`), and the CVSS score and vector. It also describes how the vulnerability was fixed (passing the connection string via stdin).
