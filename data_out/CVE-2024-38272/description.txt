There exists a vulnerability in Quick Share/Nearby, where an attacker can bypass the accept file dialog on Quick Share Windows. Normally in Quick Share Windows app we can't send a file without the user accept from the receiving device if the visibility is set to everyone mode or contacts mode. We recommend upgrading to version 1.0.1724.0 of Quick Share or above
