The provided content describes a vulnerability and its fix in the Linux kernel related to UDP Generic Receive Offload (GRO) and UDP tunnels.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the `udp_gro_receive()` function performing L4 aggregation (either `SKB_GSO_UDP_L4` or `SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST`) at the outer UDP tunnel level when it should not. This occurs when `NETIF_F_GRO_FRAGLIST` or `NETIF_F_GRO_UDP_FWD` are enabled and UDP tunnels are present.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect L4 aggregation of UDP tunnel packets.
- Potential corruption of inner protocol headers.
- Ignoring different vxlan IDs and aggregating to the same GSO packet.
- TCP over vxlan packets being held in GRO engine until next flush.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Inner protocol corruption
- Data loss or corruption due to incorrect aggregation
- Denial of service by holding packets in the GRO engine

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted UDP packets through a configured UDP tunnel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network traffic to a vulnerable system.
- Knowledge of the UDP tunnel configuration of the target system.

The fix implemented in the provided patch skips the `SKB_GSO_UDP_L4` and `SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST` code path when a packet could land in a UDP tunnel. It then lets `udp_gro_receive()` perform GRO via `udp_sk(sk)->gro_receive`.
