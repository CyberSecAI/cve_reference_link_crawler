- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Product Labels For Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows malicious scripts to be injected into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, information theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality, likely due to improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through the plugin, and a 'shop manager' privilege is required.
