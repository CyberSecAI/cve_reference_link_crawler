Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-6424:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   External Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The application allows an attacker to control the destination of server-side requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The application does not properly validate the URI provided in the request, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability to:
    *   Read the source code of web files.
    *   Read internal files.
    *   Access network resources.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via the following API endpoints:
    *   `/api/Proxy/Post?userName=&password=&uri=<FILE|INTERNAL URL|IP/HOST`
    *   `/api/Proxy/Get?userName=&password=&uri=<ARCHIVO|URL INTERNA|IP/HOST`

    The `uri` parameter in these endpoints is vulnerable to manipulation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
