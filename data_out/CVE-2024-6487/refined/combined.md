## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Inline Related Posts < 3.8.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

- Go to the plugin settings page
- Click on the active checkbox
- Scroll down until you find the `Link "target" attribute` select box
- Edit the HTML and change the value of one of the select choices to '123&quot; onmouseover=alert(10) test=&quot;'
- Go to a post, insert the inline related posts block and select a related post.
- Preview the post and hover the mouse over the link
