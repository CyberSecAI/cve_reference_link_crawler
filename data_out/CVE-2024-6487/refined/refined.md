- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users (e.g., admin) can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will be executed when other users view content that uses the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker must be a high privilege user, such as an admin.
    - The attacker navigates to the plugin settings page.
    - The attacker modifies the HTML of a select box choice by injecting a malicious script.
    - When another user previews a post using the plugin, the malicious script executes when they hover over the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) in order to access and modify plugin settings.
