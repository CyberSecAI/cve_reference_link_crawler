### Description

The Getwid – Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the get\_google\_api\_key function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to set the MailChimp API key.
