Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Minikin library handles bidirectional (bidi) control characters within text layout. Specifically, the issue arises because the layout context is not properly broken before and after processing bidi control characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of bidi control characters: The core weakness is the failure to properly reset the layout context around bidi control characters. This likely leads to incorrect state and calculations within the Minikin library's layout engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS):  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted string containing problematic bidi characters. This malformed input will lead to a denial of service, which, in this case, is described as a "permanent" denial of service. This suggests the vulnerability could cause a crash or hang that prevents the affected service or the entire device from functioning correctly until a reboot or more significant intervention occurs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted string, indicating a network based attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send or provide a specially crafted text string to the vulnerable service or application. This could involve network communication, malicious file manipulation, or any method that allows them to provide the malicious input.
