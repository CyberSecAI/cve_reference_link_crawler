{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF files due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability occurs when parsing TIF files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a crafted TIF.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted TIF file that, when processed by the vulnerable software, triggers the out-of-bounds write. The attacker must also induce the user to open this file or access a malicious page hosting it."
