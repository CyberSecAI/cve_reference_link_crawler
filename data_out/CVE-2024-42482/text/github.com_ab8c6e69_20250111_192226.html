# Improper Neutralization of Delimiters in fish-shop/syntax-check

Moderate

[marcransome](/marcransome)
published
GHSA-xj87-mqvh-88w2
Aug 12, 2024

## Package

actions

fish-shop/syntax-check
([GitHub Actions](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aactions))

## Affected versions

< 1.6.12

## Patched versions

1.6.12 2.0.0

## Description

### Impact

Improper neutralisation of delimiters in the `pattern` input (specifically the command separator `;` and command substitution characters `(` and `)`) mean that arbitrary command injection is possible by modification of the input value used in a workflow. This has the potential for exposure or exfiltration of sensitive information from the workflow runner, such as might be achieved by sending environment variables to an external entity.

### Patches

As of this writing, the issue has been patched for versions in the `v1.x.x` release series in release `v1.6.12` (also tagged as `v1.6` and `v1`). The latest available release `v2.0.0` also includes a corresponding patch (also tagged as `v2.0` and `v2`).

Users should upgrade to at least the patched version `v1.6.12` or preferably the latest available version `v2.0.0`. Workflows that use the action ref `v1` will automatically receive the patched version `v1.6.12` in future workflow runs.

Patch summary:

| Release series | Patched tags | Patched commit hashes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1.x.x` | `v1.6.12`, `v1.6`, `v1` | `91e6817c48ad475542fe4e78139029b036a53b03` |
| `2.x.x` | `v2.0.0`, `v2.0`, `v2` | `c2cb11395e21119ff8d6e7ea050430ee7d6f49ca` |

### Workarounds

Is it recommended that users update to the patched version `v1.6.12` or the latest release version `v2.0.0`, however remediation may be possible through careful control of workflows and the `pattern` input value used by this action.
