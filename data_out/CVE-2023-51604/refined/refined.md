- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references during the parsing of XML files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability. The application does not properly restrict XML External Entity references.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to disclose sensitive information in the context of the current process by forcing the XML parser to access an attacker-controlled URI, and embed the content back into the XML document.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must provide a crafted XML document with a malicious URI. The victim needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML file or control a website the victim interacts with. The attacker does not need prior authentication. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
