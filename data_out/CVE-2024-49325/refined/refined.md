Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function of the WordPress Photo Gallery Builder Plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a broken access control vulnerability (OWASP A1). This means that the plugin does not properly verify if the user has permission to perform a certain action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function. In general, a successful exploit could lead to unauthorized actions being performed by lower-privileged users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a vulnerable function within the plugin that lacks proper access control checks.
*   A user with subscriber-level privileges can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user of the WordPress site, with at least a subscriber level of privileges.
*   No special privileges are needed beyond this.
