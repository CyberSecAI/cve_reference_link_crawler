The provided content is a GitHub commit and a generic Huntr page. Neither of them contains information related to a vulnerability or a CVE. The GitHub commit shows a change to a cloudformation template, specifically adding an iptables rule to block access to the AWS metadata service at `169.254.169.254`. This change aims to mitigate potential unauthorized access to sensitive information through the metadata service, but it doesn't describe a pre-existing vulnerability, but rather a proactive security enhancement.

Therefore, the correct response is: **NOINFO**
