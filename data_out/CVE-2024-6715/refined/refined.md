- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ditty plugin re-introduced a previously fixed security issue in versions 3.1.39 to 3.1.45.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code is then executed in the browsers of users who view the affected content, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions within the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by editing or adding a Ditty, and inserting the XSS payload in the "Content Title" field when adding default content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Author privileges.
