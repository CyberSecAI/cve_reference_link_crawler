Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-3653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `LearningPushHandler` in Undertow, a web server component. When this handler is enabled, and its `maxAge` configuration is left unconfigured, it defaults to -1. This default setting makes the handler vulnerable to a remote memory denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unconfigured `maxAge`:** The primary weakness is the lack of a proper configuration for the `maxAge` parameter in the `LearningPushHandler`. The default value of -1 leads to an exploitable state.
- **Memory Consumption:** The handler, when exploited, can consume excessive memory, leading to DoS conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a DoS condition, where the server becomes unresponsive due to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Normal HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending normal HTTP requests to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the server and be able to send HTTP requests.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or authenticated access to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Configuration Dependency:** The `LearningPushHandler` must be enabled on the server and the `maxAge` parameter left at its default value for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

- The `LearningPushHandler` is disabled by default which mitigates the risk if default settings are unchanged.
- Setting an appropriate value for the `maxAge` parameter mitigates the vulnerability.

- Several Red Hat products, including JBoss EAP and Quarkus, are affected by this vulnerability.

- NetApp products are also affected; OnCommand Workflow Automation is mentioned as an affected product.

- Red Hat has released security advisories (RHSA) for multiple products addressing this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is rated as "Important" or "Moderate" severity depending on the source.
