| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2274437#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-04-11 04:27:38 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability requires enabling the learning-push handler in the server's config (it is disabled by default), leave the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, so it makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server with a normal HTTP request.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2274437#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-08 22:19:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2024:4392 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4392](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4392)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2274437#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-08 17:22:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:5145 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5145](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5145)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2274437#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-08 17:22:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:5143 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5143](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5143)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2274437#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-08 17:23:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:5144 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5144](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5144)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2274437#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-08 17:24:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2024:5147 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5147](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5147)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2274437#c10)  Chess Hazlett    2024-11-18 20:22:31 UTC  ``` removed RHINT-CSB-3 affects as those are now handled under RHBOAC which has already called WONTFIX.   ``` |  |
