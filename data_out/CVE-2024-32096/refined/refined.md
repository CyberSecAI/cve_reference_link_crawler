- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP Migration Plugin DB & Files â€“ WP Synchro plugin, in versions <= 1.11.2, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could lead to an attacker forcing higher-privileged users to execute unintended actions. The specific impact can vary.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, can lead to unauthorized actions within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request, requiring the user to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
