Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-0355:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the `simple-get` npm package handles HTTP redirects. Specifically, when a server responds with a redirect (3xx status code) and includes a "Location" header pointing to a different host, the library does not properly discard sensitive headers like "Cookie" and "Authorization" before making the redirect request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the potential exposure of session cookies and authorization headers to unintended third-party servers during redirects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who controls the redirect destination can potentially intercept sensitive information, such as session cookies, if a user is redirected to a malicious server. This could allow the attacker to hijack user sessions or gain unauthorized access to user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited over a network.
*   **Redirection:** The attack involves a malicious server or an attacker-in-the-middle (MitM) redirecting a request to a third-party server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over Redirect Destination:** The attacker needs to be able to control the target of the redirect, typically by either controlling the server that initiates the redirect or acting as a MitM.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs because, during redirects, the library copies the headers from the initial request to the redirect request without filtering.
*   The fix involves explicitly deleting `cookie` and `authorization` headers if the redirect leads to a different host.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `simple-get` prior to `4.0.1`, `3.1.1`, and `2.8.2`.

**Additional Information:**
*   The CVSS score is 7.5, indicating a High severity.
*   The attack vector is Network, with low attack complexity, no required privileges or user interaction and a high impact on confidentiality.
*   The CWE is CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.
