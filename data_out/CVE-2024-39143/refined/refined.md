Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating or editing property content within ResidenceCMS. Specifically, the application allows low-privileged users to embed HTML code into property content which is then stored and rendered without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to a stored XSS attack. This occurs because the application saves user-controlled HTML content and later displays it to other users, including administrators, without sanitizing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into property content. When a user visits a page containing this malicious content, the injected JavaScript will execute within the user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** The attacker's JavaScript can steal cookies, which might allow the attacker to hijack the sessions of other users, including administrators.
- **Phishing:** The attacker's script can redirect users to a malicious website or display a fake login form, leading to phishing attacks.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the page or manipulate displayed content.
- **Other malicious activities:** The injected JavaScript can be used for other malicious actions, as the attacker is able to execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the property content creation/editing form that allows HTML injection.
- A low-privilege user can exploit the vulnerability, which is then triggered when the affected page is accessed by any other user (including administrators).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a low-privilege account on the ResidenceCMS system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or edit a property (which they own).
- The attacker needs to insert the malicious HTML code through the available forms/editors.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in ResidenceCMS version 2.10.1.
- The issue was reported to the developers of the software.
- A fix was initially created in a branch but it was later reported that the fix was not completely effective, as the vulnerability persisted in version 2.10.2.
