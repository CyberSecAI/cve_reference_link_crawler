* Security bulletin for Centreon Web

An audit has identified security vulnerabilities in Centreon Web.

Centreon is unaware of situations where these could have been exploited.

If an instance of Centreon Web is exposed on Internet, these vulnerabilities have a high likelihood of being exploited and have a severe impact if exploited which results in a high risk.

**Type of vulnerability :**

CVE-2024-32501 : SQL Injection, in updateServiceHost

CVE-2024-33852 : SQL Injection in Downtime component

CVE-2024-33853 : SQL Injection in Timeperiod component

CVE-2024-33854 : SQL Injection in Graph Template component

CVE-2024-5725 : SQL Injection in Metric Image component

CVE-2024-39841 : SQL Injection via service configuration

It is therefore highly recommended to apply the provided product updates as early as possible.

### **Version impacted**

* All Centreon on-premise platform versions are vulnerable.

### **Applying the fix**

Fixes have been provided for all [supported versions](https://docs.centreon.com/docs/releases/lifecycle/) and it is recommended to update Centreon Web:

* [Centreon Web 24.04.3](https://docs.centreon.com/docs/update/update-centreon-platform/)

* [Centreon Web 22.10.23](https://docs.centreon.com/docs/22.10/update/update-centreon-platform/)

These versions include cumulative fixes from prior updates.

If you are running an unsupported version, it is strongly recommended that you [upgrade](https://docs.centreon.com/docs/upgrade/introduction/) your platform to 24.04.
