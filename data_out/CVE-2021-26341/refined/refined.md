{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "AMD CPUs may transiently execute instructions following an unconditional direct branch.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Speculative execution beyond unconditional direct branches leading to detectable cache activity.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Potential data leakage through observable cache activity.",
  "Attack vectors": "Speculative execution of instructions following an unconditional direct branch.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to influence code execution to trigger the speculative execution past the branch instruction."
