```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper data validation in the post-processing steps of several Gradio components. These components handle file data, and the lack of validation allows attackers to bypass intended input constraints.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Data validation vulnerability",
    "Arbitrary file leaks due to insufficient input sanitization during file handling in post-processing steps"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to the exposure of sensitive files to unauthorized users. This can be particularly severe if combined with other vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers can craft malicious requests that bypass expected input constraints, injecting arbitrary file paths into components that process file data. Examples include providing file paths like `/etc/passwd` to a `DownloadButton` through manipulated inputs, or providing similar filepaths through other affected components to trigger file leaks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application with crafted payloads that specify arbitrary file paths. This typically involves interacting with user-facing components of the application."
