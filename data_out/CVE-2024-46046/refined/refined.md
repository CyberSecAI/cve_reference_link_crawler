- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `RouteStatic` function of the Tenda FH451 V1.0.0.9 firmware due to the lack of parameter length checks before assigning the parameter 'var' to the stack space `v4`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow vulnerability. The code does not validate the size of the `funcpara1` parameter, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer size on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By sending a specially crafted request with an overly large `funcpara1` parameter, an attacker can overwrite stack memory, potentially causing a denial of service or gaining arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `goform/setcfm` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, which is likely on the same network, or have access to the device's web interface through the internet if exposed. The attacker also requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the request format to trigger the stack overflow.
