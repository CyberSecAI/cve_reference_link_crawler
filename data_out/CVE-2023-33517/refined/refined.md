{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect Access Control",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary File Read on Back-end System",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the back-end system.",
   "Attack vectors": "The provided text does not specify the exact attack vector. However, it states an arbitrary file read can be performed due to the access control issues. This likely involves sending a request to the backend system that is not properly authorized to access files, or there is no authorization check.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have a way to interact with the backend system (e.g., through a web interface or other API). The specific capabilities aren't described, only that they can interact with the vulnerable service to send the malicious request. "
