- **Root cause of vulnerability**: HTTP desync vulnerability. The proxy mishandles crafted HTTP requests leading to a desynchronization in communication between the proxy, web server, and clients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the proxy's inability to properly process crafted HTTP requests, causing it to misinterpret request boundaries and forward responses to unintended recipients.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can send crafted HTTP requests, causing the proxy to forward web server responses to unintended clients. This allows the attacker to potentially receive sensitive information intended for other users, or cause other users to receive responses intended for the attacker, leading to information disclosure and potentially further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, involving sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable proxy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the proxy, and no authentication is required. The attacker is considered unauthenticated.
