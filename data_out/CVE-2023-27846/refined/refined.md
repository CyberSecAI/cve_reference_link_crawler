- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `tvcmsblog` module. Several PHP classes contain sensitive SQL calls that can be exploited through HTTP requests, leading to blind SQL injection. Specifically, the `rewrite`, `page_type`, and `recordsArray` variables submitted via POST or GET requests are vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Blind SQL Injection via the `rewrite`, `page_type`, and `recordsArray` parameters.
    - Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple SQL queries.
    - Unconventional HTTP header usage could bypass some WAF rules.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access to the PrestaShop installation.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Expose sensitive information from database tables, including tokens and admin ajax scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based attacks through HTTP requests.
    - Exploitation through front controller, where the module controller path can be concealed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - No privileges required
    - No user interaction required
    - Attacker can be external, no special position needed.
