{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `bq27xxx_battery_i2c_remove` function in the Linux kernel's `bq27xxx-i2c` driver unconditionally calls `free_irq(client->irq)`, which leads to a kernel panic if the i2c client does not have an IRQ (i.e., client->irq is 0).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The driver does not check if a valid IRQ exists before attempting to free it."
    ],
    "impact": "A kernel panic (denial of service) occurs when the driver is unloaded if no IRQ was requested. The system crashes when the `free_irq()` function is called with an invalid IRQ.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Unloading the `bq27xxx-i2c` driver when no IRQ is associated with the device."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger the unloading of the driver. This could be through normal device operations if the device is used on a system with no irq, or by directly unloading the module with root privileges."
  },
  "fix": {
    "description": "The fix involves adding a check in `bq27xxx_battery_i2c_remove` to ensure that `client->irq` is not 0 before calling `free_irq()`.",
