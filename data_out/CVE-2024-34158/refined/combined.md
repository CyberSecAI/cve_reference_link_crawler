constraints. The imposed limits are unlikely to ever be hit in real
world usage.

| In fact, using the use case in CL did not reproduce the stack overflow exception. In addition, in the `TestSizeLimits` function, the expression ends with "||"" or "&&". As a result, the expression is invalid. |

Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.23.1 and 1.22.7, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 3 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* go/parser: stack exhaustion in all Parse\* functions

  Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested literals can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2024-34155 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/69138>.
* encoding/gob: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Decode

  Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-30635.

  Thanks to Md Sakib Anwar of The Ohio State University (anwa...@osu.edu) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-34156 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/69139>.
* go/build/constraint: stack exhaustion in Parse

  Calling Parse on a "// +build" build tag line with deeply nested expressions can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2024-34158 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/69141>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.23.1>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.23.1` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Dmitri and Michael for the Go team
