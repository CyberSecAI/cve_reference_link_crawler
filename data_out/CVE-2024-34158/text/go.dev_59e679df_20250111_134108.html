number of stack exhaustions that can be hit when parsing overly complex
constraints. The imposed limits are unlikely to ever be hit in real
world usage.

| In fact, using the use case in CL did not reproduce the stack overflow exception. In addition, in the `TestSizeLimits` function, the expression ends with "||"" or "&&". As a result, the expression is invalid. |
