### Description

The GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and deletion of data due to a missing capability check on the 'handle\_request' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.14.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read attachment paths and delete attachment files.
