Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Oracle Help Technologies component, specifically in the Web UIX framework. When a user inserts a payload (JavaScript code), it's reflected in the response body without proper sanitization.
- When triggering a print page event, the payload is stored and associated with the page URL. When a user clicks the print button, the payload gets executed in the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. The malicious script is not only reflected on the page but is also saved and executed later.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Successful exploitation could grant an attacker unauthorized access to data accessible through Oracle Help Technologies. This includes critical and sensitive data.
-   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially perform unauthorized actions like updating, inserting, or deleting data within the application.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The core impact is arbitrary JavaScript execution in a user's browser, enabling a range of malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Oracle Help Technologies component.
-   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to navigate to a help topic, trigger the print page functionality, and view the page which stores the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Basic Knowledge of XSS:** An attacker needs a basic understanding of how to craft XSS payloads.
-   **Application Access:** The attacker needs access to the application to inject the malicious code. No special access seems required other than the ability to navigate the application and trigger the help functionalities.
- **Patience:** A successful exploitation of the stored XSS attack requires the victim to navigate to the page containing the injected payload, rather than the attacker being able to execute the payload directly.
