# Oracle Security Alert Advisory - CVE-2017-10269

## Oracle Security Alert Advisory - CVE-2017-10269

### Description

This Security Alert addresses CVE-2017-10269 and four other vulnerabilities affecting the Jolt server within Oracle Tuxedo. These vulnerabilities have a maximum CVSS score of 10.0 and may be exploited over a network without the need for a valid username and password. The Oracle Jolt client is not impacted.

Since Oracle PeopleSoft products include and use Oracle Tuxedo in their distributions, PeopleSoft customers should apply the Tuxedo patches referenced below.

Due to the severity of these vulnerabilities, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply the updates provided by this Security Alert as soon as possible.

### Security Alert Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Security Alert program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Security Alert. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Security Alert program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Security Alert program for products in the Extended Support Phase.
