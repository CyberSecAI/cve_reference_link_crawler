- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to the insecure handling of the `template` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server. This allows for arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to complete compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious `template` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication or special permissions to exploit this vulnerability. They only need network access to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker needs to know (or be able to discover) the path to a PHP file on the server, relative to the WordPress root.
