Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2781

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The same encryption process was used for encrypting both session cookies and variables within Octopus Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Shared Encryption Process:**  The core issue is the lack of distinct encryption processes for session cookies and variables. This potentially allows session cookies to be encrypted using unintended methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The advisory does not explicitly detail the specific impact, but it suggests a potential issue with how session cookies are encrypted. It could lead to unintended encryption or decryption of cookies which could potentially lead to unauthorized access if the encryption is weakened or misused.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The advisory doesn't describe a specific attack vector, but the core weakness is within the software's handling of encryption, implying that an attacker might leverage this flaw via network interactions with the Octopus server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need network access to the affected Octopus Server instance. The advisory does not explicitly specify user level or authorization requirements.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions that there are no known mitigations besides upgrading the software.
* The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Octopus Server and is rated as medium severity.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Justin Steven.
