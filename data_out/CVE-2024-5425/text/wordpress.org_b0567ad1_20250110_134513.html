## Description

LightPress Lightbox is a popular, very lightweight lightbox plugin for WordPress. It is active 40,000 websites. After activation, settings will appear under ‘Lightbox’ on your website’s main admin menu, and images and galleries will open in a nice lightbox.

To make images open in the lightbox, you need to set images to “Link To:” media file. For image blocks, this setting is on the toolbar at the top of the block. For galleries, this setting is on the sidebar by other block options.

  Default frontend appearance.

## Installation

1. Upload the `wp-jquery-lightbox`-folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Check out the jQuery Lightbox-panel in your admin interface for usage details and configuration.

## FAQ

### Trouble shooting:

If you have problems with WP jQuery Lightbox, please make sure you try these steps before asking for help. If you ask for help and I find any of these steps would fix the problem, I will just link you back here to do the work yourself.

1. Make sure your site is not throwing any javascript errors. Use [your browsers javascript console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) to find out.

If you’re running a custom theme:

1. Make sure you have [`wp_head();`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_head) just before the closing `</head>` tag of your theme, or you will break many plugins, which generally use this hook to reference JavaScript files.
2. For the same reason, always have `wp_footer();` just before the closing `</body>` tag of your theme.
3. Many JavaScript optimizers, combiners, minifiers, etc. conflict with [`wp_localize_script`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_localize_script2), used to configure this plugin and many others.

* If you have problems with jQuery Lightbox; first disable all JavaScript-optimizing plugins. (Optimize Scripts, W3 Total Cache, WP Minify etc)
* If you develop JavaScript optimizers for WordPress, please play nice with the default API…
* [More info about this issue](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/122-worked-13-does-not-work-for-me?replies=19)

Lastly:

1. Disable all other plugins, one at a time. Try the lightbox between each.
2. Revert to the default theme. Did it help? Fix your theme.
3. Search the forums for similar symptoms.

Still have problems? Post a link and describe what issue you’re having, and tell us what of these steps you’ve already tried.

### Can the lightbox display the image description instead of the title?

WP jQuery Lightbox grabs texts from three different HTML nodes;

1. `title`-attribute of link-to-image
2. `img` tag’s `title` attribute (if 1 is empty)
3. `img` tag’s `alt` attribute (if 1 and 2 is empty)
4. HTML content of `.gallery-caption` or `.wp-caption-text` (in that order)

Look at how the default TwentyTwelve theme uses these in its galleries and set up your theme so it outputs what you need in these places.

### I can see elements of my site through the overlay

It’s a problem of [z-index](http://www.w3schools.com/Css/pr_pos_z-index.asp). Check [the z-index property](http://www.w3schools.com/Css/pr_pos_z-index.asp) for the problematic elements, and force them to be less than 100. (Thanks [dway](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-jquery-lightbox-title-captions-bug-found-solved-and-fix-proposed?replies=20#post-2052340)!)

### How do I add images to a post?

[Inserting Images into Posts and Pages](https://codex.wordpress.org/Inserting_Images_into_Posts_and_Pages)

### How do I create a thumbnail gallery?

Upload images to a post (see previous question) and use [WordPress’ built-in gallery shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode): `[gallery link="file"]`

Note the `link="file"` – this is crucial! By default the gallery will link your humbnails to a page displaying your image. With `link="file"` the thumbnails links

directly to the image files – allowing Lightbox to function.

### Must fade-in and animation of all \*box-scripts be so slow?

WP-jQuery Lightbox lets you configure the animation duration and disable image resizing from the admin panel. Set duration to 0 to disable animations entirely.

### For developers:

1. Always have `wp_footer();` just before the closing `</body>` tag of your theme, or you will break many plugins, which generally use this hook to reference JavaScript files.
2. Apply lightbox to any content by running `jqlb_apply_lightbox($your_content, "any ID");` It returns a string with all image links lightboxed, grouped by `"any id"`.
3. Many JavaScript optimizers, combiners, minifiers, etc. conflict with [`wp_localize_script`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_localize_script2), used to configure this plugin and many others.

* If you have problems with jQuery Lightbox; first disable all JavaScript-optimizing plugins. (Optimize Scripts, W3 Total Cache, WP Minify etc)
* If you develop JavaScript optimizers for WordPress, please play nice with the default API…
* [More info about this issue](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/122-worked-13-does-not-work-for-me?replies=19)

### Can I help you in any way?

Indeed you can!

Translations and help with implementing them would be nice.

December 15, 2024

I have been using this photo display plugin on my site for many years before the latest updates, and I find it the simplest plugin without any add-ons like album management etc., like many other lightboxes. It also has a correct management of the display of captions linked to the “ALT” of wordpress.
