The Custom Field For WP Job Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.2 via the the 'cm_fieldshow' shortcode due to missing validation on the 'job_id' user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to expose potentially sensitive post metadata.
