Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-7049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the `job_id` parameter within the `cm_fieldshow` shortcode of the "Custom Field For WP Job Manager" plugin. This allows users to specify an arbitrary post ID, leading to the exposure of post metadata associated with that ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses the user-supplied `job_id` without verifying if the user has permission to access the post metadata associated with that ID.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The plugin does not validate the user-provided `job_id` to ensure it belongs to the 'job_listing' post type as intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive post metadata, which may contain confidential information related to job listings. This could include internal notes, contact details, or other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can insert the vulnerable `cm_fieldshow` shortcode on pages or posts they have access to, specifying an arbitrary `job_id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WordPress site with at least contributor-level access, which allows them to create and modify posts or pages, to insert the shortcode.
*   **Knowledge of Post IDs:** The attacker would need to know or guess the IDs of the posts whose metadata they wish to access.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes a changeset, highlighting the addition of post type verification to prevent IDOR, this was not present in earlier versions.
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on August 15, 2024.
* The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
* The vulnerable plugin is "Custom Field For WP Job Manager" and all versions up to and including 1.2 are affected. Version 1.3 and later contains a fix.
