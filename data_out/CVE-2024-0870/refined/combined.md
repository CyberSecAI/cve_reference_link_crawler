### Description

The YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'save\_mail\_status' and 'save\_email\_settings' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.12.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify WooCommerce settings.
