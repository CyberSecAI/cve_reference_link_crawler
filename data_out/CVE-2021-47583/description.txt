In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mxl111sf: change mutex_init() location

Syzbot reported, that mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() uses uninitialized
mutex. The problem was in wrong mutex_init() location.

Previous mutex_init(&state->msg_lock) call was in ->init() function, but
dvb_usbv2_init() has this order of calls:

	dvb_usbv2_init()
	  dvb_usbv2_adapter_init()
	    dvb_usbv2_adapter_frontend_init()
	      props->frontend_attach()

	  props->init()

Since mxl111sf_* devices call mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() in ->frontend_attach()
internally we need to initialize state->msg_lock before
frontend_attach(). To achieve it, ->probe() call added to all mxl111sf_*
devices, which will simply initiaize mutex.
