The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47583.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the incorrect location of `mutex_init(&state->msg_lock)`. It was previously called within the `->init()` function, which occurred *after* `->frontend_attach()`, where the `mxl111sf_ctrl_msg()` function was being used, leading to the use of an uninitialized mutex.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an uninitialized mutex. The `mxl111sf_ctrl_msg()` function was using the `state->msg_lock` without proper initialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability could lead to race conditions, data corruption, or other undefined behavior since an uninitialized mutex is used in the driver. The specific consequences are undefined as it depends on the context and timing of the race condition.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the DVB USB subsystem driver for mxl111sf devices. Any operation that calls the `mxl111sf_ctrl_msg()` function within the `->frontend_attach()` function before the mutex is initialized can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to trigger the initialization of the `mxl111sf` DVB USB device driver in such a way that `mxl111sf_ctrl_msg()` is called before the mutex is initialized. This could potentially be achieved through normal device operation.

The fix involves moving the `mutex_init(&state->msg_lock)` call to the `->probe()` function, which is called before `->frontend_attach()`. This ensures that the mutex is always initialized before being used.
