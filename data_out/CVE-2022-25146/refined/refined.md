Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-25146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of origin validation in the Remote App module when processing event messages. Specifically, the module doesn't verify if the origin of an incoming event message matches the expected origin of the remote application it's interacting with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF token exfiltration:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially steal the CSRF token associated with a user's session by crafting a malicious event message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exfiltrate a user's CSRF token. While the provided description doesn't specify the full impact of exfiltrating the CSRF token, it could lead to more serious attacks like:
    *   Performing actions on behalf of a user without their consent.
    *   Potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
    *   Modifying user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is launched remotely, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the affected server or system.
*   **Crafted Event Message:** The attacker sends a specially crafted event message to the vulnerable Remote App module.
*   **Event Message Response:** The module's response to the crafted event message inadvertently includes the user's CSRF token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the malicious event message.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker doesn't need prior user credentials, making it easier for the exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** The exploit requires some level of user interaction as the user must be logged in to Liferay to have a session where the CSRF token can be exfiltrated.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Liferay Portal versions 7.4.3.4 through 7.4.3.8.
*   The issue was reported by Jakub Zoczek from Securitum.
*   The fix is included in Liferay Portal version 7.4.3.9.
