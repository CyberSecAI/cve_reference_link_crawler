Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Overwolf loads and executes DLL files from a user-writable folder when launched. This occurs in the SYSTEM context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The application is not verifying the origin of the DLL files loaded, it will load any DLL file placed in a user writable directory.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability exists because a process runs with SYSTEM privileges and loads a DLL from a user-writable folder, which can be controlled by a low privileged user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, potentially leading to complete control over the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with low privilege user can gain SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **DLL Planting:** The attacker crafts a malicious DLL and places it in a user-writeable location. When Overwolf is launched, the malicious DLL will be executed as SYSTEM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low privilege access to the local system where Overwolf is installed.
- The attacker must be able to write files to a directory where Overwolf will load libraries from.

**Affected/Fixed Versions:**
- Affected versions: Overwolf versions prior to 250.1.1
- Fixed version: 250.1.1
