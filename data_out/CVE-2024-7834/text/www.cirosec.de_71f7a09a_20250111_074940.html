## CVE: CVE-2024-7834: Local Privilege Escalation

A local privilege escalation is caused by Overwolf loading and executing certain dynamic link library files from a user-writeable folder in SYSTEM context on launch. This allows an attacker with unprivileged access to the system to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by placing a malicious .dll file in the respective location.

The vulnerability was acknowledged and fixed by Overwolf within 3 weeks. We want to thank Overwolf for their exemplary reaction to the vulnerability report.

**CVSS Score**7.8 (CVSS v3) https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7834
