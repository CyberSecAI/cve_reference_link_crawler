A local privilege escalation is caused by Overwolf
loading and executing certain dynamic link library files from a user-writeable
folder in SYSTEM context on launch. This allows an attacker with unprivileged
access to the system to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by placing a
malicious .dll file in the respective location.
