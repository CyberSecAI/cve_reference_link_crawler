*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The WordPress "Order Your Posts Manually" plugin, versions 2.2.5 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

This could lead to redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads being injected. The specific impact can vary but allows for arbitrary actions.
