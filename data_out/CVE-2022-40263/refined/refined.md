- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The BD Totalysâ„¢ MultiProcessor versions 1.70 and earlier contain hardcoded credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hardcoded credentials within the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If exploited, threat actors may be able to access, modify, or delete sensitive information, including electronic protected health information (ePHI), protected health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information (PII). Incorrect patient-slide association could lead to inappropriate patient management.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical or network access to the system is required, along with bypassing additional security controls.  On systems with Windows 10, attackers would need to gain access to Windows authentication credentials (Remote Workstation) or break out of kiosk mode (Instrument) to gain access to the underlying Windows operating system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need physical or network access to the system and the ability to bypass additional security controls. For Windows 10 installations, access to Windows authentication credentials or the ability to break out of kiosk mode would be needed.
