- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Master Slider plugin lacks CSRF checks when deleting sliders.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting sliders, potentially disrupting website functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, triggers the slider deletion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious page and submit the form.
