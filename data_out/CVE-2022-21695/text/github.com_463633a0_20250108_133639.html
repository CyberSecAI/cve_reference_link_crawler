# OTF-009: Improper Access Control: Authenticated users (or unauthenticated in public mode) can send messages without being visible in the list of chat participants

Low

GHSA-99p8-9p2c-49j4

## Package

OnionShare
(OnionShare)

## Affected versions

>= 2.3

## Patched versions

2.5

## Description

Between September 26, 2021 and October 8, 2021, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) conducted a penetration test of OnionShare 2.4, funded by the Open Technology Fund's [Red Team lab](https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab/). This is an issue from that penetration test.

* Vulnerability ID: OTF-009
* Vulnerability type: Improper Access Control
* Threat level: Low

## Description:

Authenticated users (or unauthenticated in public mode) can send messages without being visible in the list of chat participants.

## Technical description:

Prerequisites:

* Existing chatroom
* Access to the chatroom (Public or known Private Key)
* Either a modified frontend client or manual requests from burp/curl

If a user opens the chatroom without emitting the join message he will not be present in session.users[x] list. Therefore there is no listing in the frontend and no chat participant knows another party joined the chat. It is still possible to send messages in the chatroom.

If a user decides to abuse OTF-003 (page 22) he can impersonate messages from existing users; others would not be able to distinguish original and faked messages. This is also a prerequisite for OTF-004 (page 19).

## Impact:

An adversary with access to the chat environment can send messages to the chat without being visible in the list of chat participants.

## Recommendation:

* Allow chat access only after emission of the join event.
* Implement proper session handling.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-21695
