This vulnerability is due to a logic error and improper management of resources related to the handling of CAPWAP Mobility messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CAPWAP Mobility packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected device. This would cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9800-mob-dos-342YAc6J>  This advisory is part of the September 2022 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: September 2022 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74745)  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software and are part of a Mobility group (disabled by default):    + Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controllers for Cloud   + Catalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controller for Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches   + Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Device Configuration A device is affected by this vulnerability if it is part of a Mobility group. To determine whether a device is part of a Mobility group, use the command **show wireless mobility summary**. At the end of the output generated by this command, the Mobility peers are listed under **Controllers configured in the Mobility Domain**, including the current controller. If the only entry is the current device, then it is not part of a Mobility group and is not affected. If there are devices listed other than the current device, then it is part of a Mobility group and is affected.  The example output below (layout changed for readability purposes) shows two devices: the device where the command was issued and its Mobility peer. Therefore, the example device is part of a Mobility group and is affected.  ```   WLC#show wireless mobility summary Mobility SummaryWireless Management VLAN: 999Wireless Management IP Address: 9.9.9.9Wireless Management IPv6 Address: Mobility Control Message DSCP Value: 48Mobility High Cipher : FalseMobility DTLS Supported Ciphers: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_AES128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_RSA_AES256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_RSA_AES128_CBC_SHAMobility Keepalive Interval/Count: 10/3Mobility Group Name: defaultMobility Multicast Ipv4 address: 0.0.0.0Mobility Multicast Ipv6 address: ::Mobility MAC Address: 001e.ffff.ffffMobility Domain Identifier: 0x34acControllers configured in the Mobility Domain:   ```      | IP | Public Ip | MAC Address | Group Name | Multicast IPv4 | Multicast IPv6 | Status | PMTU |   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | **9.9.9.9** | N/A | 001e.ffff.ffff | default | 0.0.0.0 | :: | N/A | N/A |   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | **9.9.9.10** | 9.9.9.10 | 001e.ffff.fffe | default | 0.0.0.0 | :: | Up | 1385 |    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Embedded Wireless Controller on Catalyst Access Points   + IOS Software   + IOS XR Software   + Meraki products   + NX-OS Software   + Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) AireOS Software  Indicators of Compromise  * The [Cisco Security Indicators of Compromise Reference Guide](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/iocs.html "Cisco Security Indicators of Compromise Reference Guide") lists commonly observed IoCs, which can help identify devices that may have been impacted by the vulnerability disclosed in this Cisco security advisory.  Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a crash of the **mobilityd** process on an affected device.
