- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error and improper management of resources in the processing of Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Mobility messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper resource management. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the software handles CAPWAP Mobility messages which can lead to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by exhausting resources, which results in the affected device reloading. The mobilityd process crashes, causing the device to reload.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted CAPWAP Mobility packets to an affected device. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker with network access to the affected device can send crafted CAPWAP mobility packets.

This content provides more detail than the basic CVE description by describing the specific vulnerable process (mobilityd), the type of packets used (CAPWAP Mobility), and providing example crash log messages.
