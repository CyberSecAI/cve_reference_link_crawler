- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability (CWE-200) exists in FortiSIEM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Full path disclosure. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to obtain the absolute path of files used by the supervisor.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information (absolute paths) which could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to cause further damage.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the FortiSIEM system.
