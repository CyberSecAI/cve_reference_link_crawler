- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application, which would be executed by other users when they access the affected parts of the application. This could lead to various impacts, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is stored, meaning that the malicious script is stored on the server (likely within the database) and then executed when a user loads a page with the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application. The precise method to accomplish this injection is not outlined in this document.
