The content is related to CVE-2021-36646.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `path` parameter from the GET request is directly echoed into the HTML without any sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application doesn't sanitize user-supplied input (`$_GET['path']`) before echoing it into the HTML context.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions. In this specific case, the attacker can send a phishing email to the administrator to steal admin's cookie and take control of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed through a crafted URL, injecting javascript code into the `path` parameter (e.g., `http://example.com/index.php?explorer/fileView&path=<script>alert(1234)</script>`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking a malicious URL. The attacker does not require prior access to the application.
