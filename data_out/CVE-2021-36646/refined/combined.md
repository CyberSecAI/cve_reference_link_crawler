| Analyse file: app/template/api/view.html  ``` G.shareInfo = {     path:"<?php echo $_GET['path'];?>",     name:"<?php echo get_path_this($_GET['path']);?>",     mtime:0,     size:0 }  ```  No any safety check for variable(path), it direct to echo in the page. Attacker can use this bug to send fish email to administrator and catch the admin's cookie so that control the website.
