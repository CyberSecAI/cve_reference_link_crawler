```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cgiserver.cgi` program incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element within a command will always be an object. When a non-object (e.g., a string) is provided as the `param`, the program attempts to access it using the subscription operator, leading to an assertion failure and a subsequent device reboot.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The application does not validate the type of the `param` JSON element, leading to a type confusion vulnerability."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted HTTP request that results in the `cgiserver.cgi` process crashing and the device rebooting.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON payload in the body where the param field is a non-object (e.g. an empty string).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device. If authentication is required, the attacker may be able to bypass it by exploiting TALOS-2021-1420"
