- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Textpattern CMS v4.8.7 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Body" parameter when creating or editing content. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTML Injection, a type of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code that can be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected content. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. In the provided example, the injected script attempts to extract and display the user's cookies.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the admin panel of the Textpattern CMS, an attacker can inject HTML into the `Content > Write > Body` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the Textpattern CMS admin panel.
