- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Franfinance module for PrestaShop uses the Atos SIPS v1 platform for payment validation, which involves decrypting returned data using a binary file execution. The module is vulnerable to OS command injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of the input data used in the execution of this binary file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78). This allows for command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject an arbitrary executable script, leading to the potential control and hijacking of the PrestaShop instance. This could result in complete compromise of the system including data theft and malware deployment.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely over the network. For version 1.x, the vulnerability can be exploited even if the module is disabled, while for version 2.x, the module needs to be enabled.
