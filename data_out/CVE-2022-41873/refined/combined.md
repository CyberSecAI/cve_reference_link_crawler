### @Scepticz **[Scepticz](/Scepticz)** commented [Jul 20, 2022](#issue-1311134489)

While the bounds check is performed on `l2cap_channel_count`, only the lower byte is checked due to the uint8\_t data type. Afterwards, the expression for `i` is re-calculated without the explicit data type, which means without truncation into 8 bits. Instead, the full 16-bit value is used as the channel index. This pointer will point out-of-bounds of the channel array.

This leads to a large 16 out-of-bounds channel id to be used as an index into the array for large CID inputs.

Sample value: 0xff41 -> 0xff41 - 0x41 = 0xff00 == 0x00 (as uint8\_t)

This results in out-of-bounds memory to be interpreted as a channel object, and this memory to potentially be corrupted in the following call to `input_l2cap_frame_flow_channel`, which fills the out-of-bounds memory (the supposed channel object) with user-supplied data.

The fix here is to re-use the `i` variable as an index, which was used to perform the bounds check, and is truncated to 8 bits.

As a side note, due to the unsignedness of the data type `uint8_t i`, the check `i >= 0` is always true. Instead, a signed data type such as `int16_t` could be used to make the check take effect.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Out-of-bounds read in BLE L2CAP module

Moderate

[nvt](/nvt)
published
GHSA-m5cj-fw8m-ffgf
Nov 10, 2022

## Package

ble-l2cap

## Affected versions

<= 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of the Contiki-NG operating system needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get\_channel\_for\_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.

However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request [2081](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2081).

### For more information

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng>
* Email us at security@contiki-ng.org

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-41873

### Weaknesses

[CWE-125](/advisories?query=cwe%3A125)
