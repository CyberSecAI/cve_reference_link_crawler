Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `TourController` in the `pollit` application. Specifically, the `show` action was using `render (params[:page] ||= 'start')`. This allows an attacker to control the value passed to the `render` method through the `page` parameter, potentially leading to arbitrary file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Arbitrary File Inclusion (Local File Inclusion):**  The `render` method, when provided with user-controlled input, could render views or potentially include arbitrary files present on the server's file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly stated, the ability to include arbitrary files can often be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if an attacker can upload and include a malicious file.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the server.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker would send a crafted HTTP request to the `TourController#show` action with a malicious value in the `page` parameter.
- For example, a URL like `http://example.com/tour?page=../../../../etc/passwd` would attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file from the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication would be needed to exploit this vulnerability because access to the `TourController#show` is not protected, based on the provided code.

**Additional details:**

- The provided commit (`6ef04f8`) shows the fix for this vulnerability. The vulnerable line: `render (params[:page] ||= 'start')` was changed to `render (params[:page].to_s ||= 'start')`. This change converts the `params[:page]` value to a string before rendering, mitigating the risk of arbitrary file inclusion. This forces the render method to treat the input as view name and not a file path.
