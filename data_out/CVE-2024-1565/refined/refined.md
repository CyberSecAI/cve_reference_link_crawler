Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-1565:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the EmbedPress plugin's PDF widget URL functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input, specifically within the PDF widget URL, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages via the PDF widget URL.
*   **Compromise of User Sessions:** When a user accesses a page with the injected script, the attacker's code will execute within the user's browser session. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **PDF Widget URL:** The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the URL field in the PDF widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows for adding and editing content, including the ability to use the EmbedPress plugin's PDF widget.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Functionality:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it through the PDF widget URL.

**Additional Information:**
