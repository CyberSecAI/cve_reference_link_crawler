In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: fix neighbour and rtable leak in smc_ib_find_route()

In smc_ib_find_route(), the neighbour found by neigh_lookup() and rtable
resolved by ip_route_output_flow() are not released or put before return.
It may cause the refcount leak, so fix it.
