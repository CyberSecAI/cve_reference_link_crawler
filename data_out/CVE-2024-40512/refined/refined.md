Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the `serverMReporting.asmx` function of openPetra v.2023.02.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, specifically the `tab` parameter in the URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This can be exploited to steal session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking or other malicious actions.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Beyond stealing cookies, successful XSS can be used to perform other browser-based attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes an XSS payload within the `tab` parameter of the `serverMReporting.asmx` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:**  The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability, making it easily exploitable.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the target application and must be able to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
