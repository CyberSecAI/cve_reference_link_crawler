*   **Change item visibility:** Attackers can modify the visibility settings of various items within the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints.
*   **AJAX requests:**  Attackers exploit the vulnerable AJAX functions by sending crafted HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
