The provided content is related to CVE-2023-51828.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in the `/admin/convert/export_z3950_new.php` file.
- The vulnerability is due to insecure concatenation of user-supplied input (`$query` parameter) in the SQL query within the `get_next_notice` function (located in `/admin/convert/export.class.php`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can allow attackers to extract session identifiers of other users, including the administrator, and use them to gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted GET request to `/admin/convert/export_z3950_new.php` with a malicious `query` parameter.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
