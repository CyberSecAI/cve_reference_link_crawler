- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CKAN plugins (XLoader, DataPusher, Resource proxy, ckanext-archiver) download content from URLs provided by users without proper validation or restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to lack of URL validation when downloading remote or local files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can create a resource with a URL pointing to internal services or other restricted resources that they should not have access to, enabling them to retrieve their contents. This could expose sensitive internal resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker crafts a malicious URL in a CKAN resource.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a CKAN user with the ability to create/modify resources.
    - The attacker must be able to supply a URL to a CKAN resource.
    - The attacker needs high privileges.
    - User interaction is required as an action needs to be performed on the resource by the affected CKAN plugins to trigger the download.
