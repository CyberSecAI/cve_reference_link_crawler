It took the world 15 years and nearly 10 years after his death to understand this. I remember asking people who supported Google before or after their IPO how they make money with your Data. No one cares. I remember pushing for Firefox instead of Chrome in 2009, no one cares. Not even on HN. The sad thing is that those who stood up for privacy got bashed down for so many years and never received an apology. Those who defended Big Tech like Google is safe to use our data never apologised. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [m463](user?id=m463) [6 months ago](item?id=40923470)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40923371) | [next](#40933403) [–]  > No one cares. People do care, they are just sort of powerless to do anything. Try the following exercises: - try not to use google docs at work - try to block google sites from your phone - try to pay for things on the internet without accessing google/recaptcha/etc it is both too big and too small of a problem for most people to deal with. I know most technical people have done these sorts of things, but it is sort of like being your own sysadmin/security researcher.

My bank's online site takes upwards of 2 seconds to redraw in Firefox now when I scroll, whereas in Chrome scrolling is virtually instantaneous. Same thing with Google Streetview. PDF rendering in Firefox and Thunderbird takes upwards of 20 seconds to render the first page of common documents, while evince is a few hundred milliseconds. This is on my latop running recent Fedora. I'm still mostly using Firefox, but my patience is almost done. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [soco](user?id=soco) [6 months ago](item?id=40969008)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40933403) | [next](#40933767) [–]  I don't think it's fair to call that "performance gap", when for sure your bank never invested one second to even test, to say nothing of optimizing their site for Firefox.

It’s funny to see people admit with the AI stuff that apple is getting it right, introducing privacy-protecting approaches and services, etc, yet refuse to admit that the same perspective and approaches have informed all their services for a long time. In the day to day, there is no legitimate debate that Apple Maps is vastly more privacy preserving than google maps, etc. People use some weird purity test where because App Store ads exist suddenly apple is the same as a literal adtech company. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [alemanek](user?id=alemanek) [6 months ago](item?id=40921783)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40921619) | [next](#40925240) [–]  If Apple still made a router I would buy it.

They sell broken-by-design devices with decades old kernel for an exuberant price but people still fall for the stale "sEcUrItY" marketing pitch. Talk about naive. and see, the problem is that people think this passes for a rebuttal, or even civilized discourse. You're literally the exact cliche that pops up in every discussion around privacy that I was referring to in my comment above. It truly costs you nothing to have a little bit of civility and class. Most of us are here to discuss and not to meme about “le apple CSAM”. I'm guessing that you're arguing about something that literally doesn't exist, to be honest. Endpoint CSAM scanning was never rolled out to consumer devices, it was a *proposal* from the EU (that popular savior!) that Apple successfully stalled and navigated until E2E was ready for rollout, upon which they said "lol no, that's stupid" and then the push fell apart. Regardless though, complying with lawful authorities inside their jurisdictions is something that every corporation is gonna have to do... even in china. If the EU makes dumb decisions, it's not exactly Apple's fault. EU sovereignty cuts both ways, sometimes you get GDPR and sometimes you get mandatory nannyware. But since it didn't pass, I don't know why you'd bring it up as even an issue, let alone as being something caused by apple? And again, to go back to the start, the fact that this vague "apple bad" argumentation is so routine and so tolerated is silly. You're mad about something that wasn't caused by apple and *didn't actually happen anyway*. It's vague tonal FUD and virtue-signaling to other people who are similar haters, and there's enough people who upvote/echo similar sentiments that it is self-sustaining. You can address the point without ducking out to random "but what about that one unrelated-to-apple bad-thing that almost happened that one time???" virtue-signaling points.

Closed operating systems, applications, drivers, can all be used to exfiltrate data unbeknownst to users, including administrators. We're forced to give them some trust, otherwise the only choice would be to use only systems, software, hardware that is completely open down to the last bit, which sadly don't exist as a whole. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cqqxo4zV46cp](user?id=cqqxo4zV46cp) [6 months ago](item?id=40922552)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40921369) | [next](#40925245) [–]  This sort of ideological take is lacking necessary nuance is and ultimately thought-terminating. There’s a difference between trust and concrete proof that something is happening, and there are degrees of both.

BTW, I don't live under a rock, I do online banking from the PC and have pretty much given up telling my lawyer and doctor not to use Whatsapp to send and receive sensitive documents, then keep them in their unencrypted phones, but that doesn't prevent me to be worried by how easy it has become to obtain personal data about someone for those who can. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JohnFen](user?id=JohnFen) [6 months ago](item?id=40919691)   | [parent](#40918007) | [prev](#40918054) | [next](#40918640) [–]  I'm certainly not OK with that. I'm not OK with a router sending anything whatsoever off to a mystery server somewhere (sending data somewhere when the user overtly sets it up to do so is OK), and any router that does that is not fit for purpose in my view. That said, I haven't considered Linksys routers to be fit for purpose at all for years now anyway. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Reubachi](user?id=Reubachi) [6 months ago](item?id=40920182)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40919691) | [next](#40920183) [–]  I understand your concerns and feel exactly the same. But I think at a certain point you can only care so much and dedicate so much time to it. With a home network you can obfuscate so much with little know how, and further you ultimately are "aware" of all packets being sent via examining your own traffic. The real problem is cars, IoT Devices. Do you drive a vehicle newer than model year ~2015? That thing is sending all kinds of telemetry to OEM manufacturer and their entire supply line of OEM suppliers. That data is firstly used to audit and evaluate functions in the vehicle for future iterations....but then that data is sold as many times as they can to research firms, advertisers, gov't planning boards etc. Taking ownership of the vehicle is you signing away any investigation or litigation rights, or even access to those data/data systems. I think THIS is where data privacy awareness needs to be pivoted to, Geolocating "iot" devices like vehicle CPU that no one, not even service techs can ever access. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JohnFen](user?id=JohnFen) [6 months ago](item?id=40920495)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40920182) | [next](#40921111) [–]  > Do you drive a vehicle newer than model year ~2015? No, I don't, for that exact reason. Some things are important enough for me to go to the effort to find a way to mitigate the security threat they pose. Other things, like relatively modern cars and IoT devices that I can't control, aren't important enough to do that.

The US, for example, allows one to build a kit car totally by ones-self, and the waitlist for VIN certification is fairly short. If you want to shortcut the VIN certification you can build a car on a car that has at least 30% of the original frame in tact and piggy-back onto that VIN number with proper certification. If that frame is older than the mid 70s, go hog-wild; you can operate it with a coal engine if you want to. If you're a 'dedicated individual' that is concerned with having a modern car that is engineered well for safety's sake, then go buy a kit from the hundreds of companies that do nothing but engineering work. If you're afraid that there will be electrification mandates, no worries -- there are hundreds of startups focused on the conversion of existing ICEs into EVs. What I'm trying to say : a world locked down to prevent all forms of vehicular autonomy is a lot different than the one we exist in today; it's not something easily predictable to assume when that will end, given the many different venues one can explore to express vehicular autonomy and individualistic choice. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ozfive](user?id=ozfive) [6 months ago](item?id=40933838)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40924051) | [prev](#40927115) | [next](#40921111) [–]  I ripped my GPS out of the head unit of a 2020 Toyota Corolla.

Auto OEMs as a rule have more "data points" for inference than any other hardware platform/software integration. IE; actions you take in the car and the info gleamed from those actions ar more valuable to marketers than data from your cell phone. None of this needs a gps signal, there are dozens of speed,time,weight,weather,delta, sensors.. Ford for example can brag that it, more than any other manufacturer on the planet, knows exactly how often you go to gas station X from location Y, if you get gas, and where you go after. They can tell where you look, how much you weigh, your common routine, even your contacts PID. You type of "personality" can be determined trivially (IE buying/travel habits). Your vehicle is 100 percent complicent in building a marketing/safety profile for you. Is this^ even "bad"? I think so. But I am not an expert and have yet to have an issue with it in my life. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [st3fan](user?id=st3fan) [6 months ago](item?id=40921111)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40920182) | [prev](#40920495) | [next](#40920856) [–]  > But I think at a certain point you can only care so much and dedicate so much time to it. That is most likely what \_Linksys\_ did. Please! Lets not just accept this poor state of security and somehow try to be apologetic for this issue. The BAR IS SO LOW .. Do not send unencrypted PII over the internet. And bonus points for not sharing someone's WiFi password with a third party. A third party in the US. We can probably assume that some three letter US government agency has intercepted all these requests. The bar is really low. This is basic stuff.

While I do still encourage people to do this as any security is better than no security, it is worth noting that you can entirely bypass things like a DNS block (i.e. pihole). For example, your browser probably does. Idk where it is in Chrome, but in Firefox you can go to Settings > Privacy & Security[0] and down at the bottom is "Enable DNS over HTTPS using:". Which, in general, I'd also encourage people to use. Cloudflare suggests this feature is available in Brace, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox[1] So I'm saying there's an extra step to be aware of because if you rely on only DNS to perform the blocking, then it may not catch everything because there might just be a host file with the IPs manually specified. Which isn't unlikely. I think the bigger problem is the complexity of all of this and how we're all being spied on unknowingly and in unexpected ways (you might know that you're being spied on in some ways but I'm willing to bet there's also ways you don't know). It's pervasive, invasive, and quite difficult to escape for even technologically adept people. And we shouldn't have a society where people are victims of things just because they do not have domain expertise in that subject matter. No one is a domain expert in all domains and it would be ludicrous to suggest one could be in even several of the critical ones.

If your TV is connected to an already networked box via a HDMI cable, chances are that it won't need a WiFi connection to go online.

I'm not sure this has been proven but it seems a bit hard to catch and it seems like a thing that could be done in the name of accessibility. I'd be interested if anyone has dumped firmware and looked to see if it does or doesn't happen. Either way, not connecting your TV to wifi isn't an excuse for the behavior. Good for you, but that doesn't justify their actions or make anybody who is not up to date with what kind of spying happens any less of a victim. It shouldn't happen even if you are able to get around them. You should be able to use wifi AND not be spied on. Full stop.

Have you thought about the ethics of what you are doing. Anyway while I would not call the original accusation of the TV using any open WIFI automatically out of the question this experiment provides little evidence of that. It's hardly unthinkable that your neighbor or someone using their TV just clicked OK on some prompts to make them go away and thereby selecting the first network in the list. It's also not unthinkable that your neighbor *wanted* to use some functionality that requires an internet connection to setup and just didn't pay attention to the WIFI network selection. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cma](user?id=cma) [6 months ago](item?id=40921814)   | [root](#40918007) | [parent](#40920201) | [prev](#40920609) | [next](#40918640) [–]  I think Fire TVs may connect over Amazon Sidewalk to someone walking by your house.

For sure that is slightly weirder than DOCSIS (which is all I've ever known personally). Since it's not really a standard like DOCSIS you probably "must have" some piece of Verizon-proprietary gear whether rented or otherwise and I'm sure Verizon remote-manages those in the same basic ways like you said. But I am pretty sure that still, security-conscious or advanced users can disable the Verizon device's WiFi and drop it into bridge mode and provide their own router and APs.

They charge $15/month for the router/modem which doesn’t sound too bad, but is $180/year on a device that retails for $180 or so.

AT&T has the WiFi password printed on the device along with the admin password. That's my experience with ISPs in SF. It's clear that many people don't buy Internet access.

But I've assisted people who's mental model is simply "Verizon put this box in my home and now I have internet". Who panic when a site doesn't load, and will call the first person they think is responsible for the problem. (typically, the company that gave them internet). Or more commonly nowadays, "my phone is my internet connection" -- and the only thing they think they have the power to do is to wave the phone in the air to find 'more bars'. I suppose it makes *sense* from Verizon's (or any ISPs) perspective, and honesty, if you understand how all this works, then you understand how to trivially eliminate the issue, and then of course, you know when and when not to call Verizon with problems. (Of course, it'd be awful nice if they offered 'Shibboleet' [1] service for folks who do undertsand when the problem is between the site and the router.)

This has turned into the same abuse of customers we see from others. For example TP Link uses the same dark patterns in their routers as companies like Roku, where they make updates to the terms of service and force you to accept it in a pop up if you want to use the app. And the app is the ONLY way to access most of the router configuration features, as compared to the old method where routers would let you navigate to a password protected website to configure them. So if you don’t accept the new terms, you can’t control your router that you were able to control all this time. Additionally their app constantly pushes trials of their useless and unwanted services through nudges within the app like red circular badges next to menu items and user interface elements. It wouldn’t surprise me if their terms also let them abuse my privacy and security in the same way as Linksys. But who else do we go to? Every company is doing this. Maybe they just cannot survive without it. It’s probably why we need regulation here (consequences for security breaches, limitations on terms of service abuse, etc). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [abadpoli](user?id=abadpoli) [6 months ago](item?id=40918444)   | [prev](#40918324) | [next](#40917902) [–]  Is this *actually* plaintext, or is this plaintext-inside-HTTPS? The article and source material don’t say. It’s pretty normal for passwords to be “plaintext” inside an HTTPS request. That’s how practically every login to a web app works. If it’s not HTTPS, there’s a whole slew of other issues along with putting a plaintext password in the request. If it is HTTPS, then the issue really is just that the password gets sent anywhere rather than staying local. This is a lot more debatable as a practice, but unfortunately is also common for a lot of routers to support their cloud/app management functionalities. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SahAssar](user?id=SahAssar) [6 months ago](item?id=40918606)   | [parent](#40918444) | [next](#40919637) [–]  > is also common for a lot of routers to support their cloud/app management functionalities Why does the cloud need to know the wifi password to support mgmt functionalities? The only reasons I can think of right now are for more "automatic" setup of a second unit for meshing or if you want a factory reset to have the same password. Both of those cases have better solutions. If it's for setting a new password I don't see why they need the old one, if it's for remote management access using the wifi password as the access credential then that seems both bad (access to my network should not mean access to manage it) and like it can be done a lot better if actually needed (send just a well salted and hashed password). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [iudqnolq](user?id=iudqnolq) [6 months ago](item?id=40918732)   | [root](#40918444) | [parent](#40918606) | [next](#40919637) [–]  This appears to be a cloud password first stetup feature. As in you type your new password into the app, the app sends your password to a cloud API, and then the cloud API instructs the router to change to the new password over a management API. So the password is sent for a specific feature that legitimately wants it. You could have the app connect to a special WiFi network and then communicate directly with an API exposed by the router. That's what my router does. But the experience of using a special-purpose WiFi network is janky on many common devices so I understand not taking that choice. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [abadpoli](user?id=abadpoli) [6 months ago](item?id=40918774)   | [root](#40918444) | [parent](#40918732) | [next](#40918859) [–]  > But the experience of using a speical-purpose WiFi network is janky on many common devices so I understand not taking that choice. Yea, this is my hunch as well as to why this works this way. Consumers are easily confused, and asking them to disconnect from their currently working internet connect and connect to a router that hasn’t yet been set up (and might not be able to provide an internet connection) can get confusing.

Their "setup app" can't connect to <http://> 192.168.1.1/ (or if if can, does so only after popping up dire warnings in scare dialogs) -- but it can connect to the "cloud" server so just send it up to the cloud and back down the WAN port. I can see how they arrived here. Still this is why "apps" suck for this purpose, but I bet they moved to apps for because there are probably plenty of households without a working computer, who need wi-fi for their phones and Rokus, and this proved to be the friendliest way to do it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SahAssar](user?id=SahAssar) [6 months ago](item?id=40919138)   | [root](#40918444) | [parent](#40918910) | [prev](#40921056) | [next](#40922256) [–]  Even if all that is true why would you not use a temporary password to then directly set the real password?

Look, I'm a cowboy coder, through and through; but I still know better than to close the barn door after the horse bolted. Information security and software processes aren't that closely related. You can be secure and yolo in production. You can run an extensive change management system and a) push mostly unnecessary cloud services, b) not use reasonable precautions to protect information in transit (and at rest) when sending to cloud services. I picked up some of the Linksys Velop wifi 6 routers recently, because OpenWRT works on them, but I figured I'd try the factory firmware first... Woof, it's bad (but I only used the web interface... I wasn't willing to install the app), I lasted a day. Forming a mesh involves the central node using the default password when accessing the other nodes. I guess that's effective, but felt pretty gross to me. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ClumsyPilot](user?id=ClumsyPilot) [6 months ago](item?id=40917784)   | [parent](#40917495) | [prev](#40918085) | [next](#40918268) [–]  > Stop cowboy coding Why are you giving this company benefit of the doubt - just because it’s western? They haven’t even bothered to comment on the issue, they made no promise to fix it, for all you know they are selling your data to the highest bidder. And to anyone from China too. If a Chinese company does it we are quick to label it stealing, but here we have the authority to regulate, and we go soft, oh no, it’s disorganisation, poor them, they’ve only been in this business for like 40 years or whatever.

The mention of Huawei was to point out the humor that the government has banned a company on the potential for subtle back doors. Something like the xz exploit.
