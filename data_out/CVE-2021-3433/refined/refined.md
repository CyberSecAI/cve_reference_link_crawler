- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An invalid channel map in a `CONNECT_IND` message leads to a deadlock.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the Bluetooth (BT) stack's handling of `CONNECT_IND` messages. Specifically, when an invalid channel map is received, it triggers a deadlock condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) due to the deadlock, which renders the affected device unresponsive or inoperable. The CVSS score reflects a low impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have some form of local access (e.g., physically nearby or on the same network segment).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to send a crafted Bluetooth `CONNECT_IND` message with an invalid channel map to the vulnerable device. No user interaction or special privileges are needed.
