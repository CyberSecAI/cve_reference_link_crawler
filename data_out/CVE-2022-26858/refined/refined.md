- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication in Dell BIOS versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication, allowing bypass of security controls.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A locally authenticated malicious user may bypass security controls by sending malicious input to an SMI. This could lead to compromise of the affected system with potential impacts on Confidentiality and Integrity of the data and system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malicious input to a System Management Interrupt (SMI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Locally authenticated malicious user with the ability to send malicious input to SMI.
