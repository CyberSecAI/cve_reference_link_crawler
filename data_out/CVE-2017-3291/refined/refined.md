Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3291, extracted from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The `mysqld_safe` script in MySQL and MariaDB honors the `ledir` option value set within a MySQL configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted `ledir` option:** The `mysqld_safe` script doesn't properly restrict the `ledir` option, which is meant to specify a directory for log files.
*   **Configuration File Manipulation:** A user able to modify MySQL configuration files can control the value of the `ledir` option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the `ledir` option to point to a controlled location, a malicious user can cause `mysqld_safe` to write log or pid files to locations where they should not have write permissions.
*   This could then lead to privilege escalation to the root user by tricking the script to overwrite critical files, by controlling file paths or similar mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local File Manipulation:** An attacker needs the ability to modify MySQL configuration files.
*   **Script Execution:** The attacker leverages the `mysqld_safe` script's behavior with the manipulated `ledir` setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to MySQL Configuration Files:** The attacker must have write access to one or more MySQL configuration files to set the malicious `ledir` value. This access can be achieved in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, exploiting another vulnerability on the system, social engineering, or compromised credentials.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the system where MySQL/MariaDB is running to be able to access configuration files and execute the vulnerable script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in both MySQL and MariaDB implementations of the `mysqld_safe` script.
*   Multiple sources specify that this vulnerability requires user interaction, as it is assumed that an attacker with this level of local system access, can also execute the affected script.
*   Multiple Red Hat advisories state "A user able to modify one of the MySQL configuration files could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root."
*   The vulnerability was addressed in MySQL version 5.6.35, 5.7.17 and MariaDB 10.0.29, by restricting the possible values for ledir.

In summary, CVE-2017-3291 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in MySQL and MariaDB caused by insufficient validation of the `ledir` option in the `mysqld_safe` script. An attacker with the ability to modify MySQL configuration files could exploit this flaw to gain root-level privileges.
