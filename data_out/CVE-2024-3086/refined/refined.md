Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the "searchdata" parameter of the `ambulance-tracking.php` page in the PHPGurukul Emergency Ambulance Hiring Portal 1.0. User-supplied input is directly embedded into the HTML response without any validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it reflects the unsanitized user-supplied input back in the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal user session cookies, leading to account impersonation and unauthorized actions.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing or malware-hosting websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the "searchdata" parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker can send the malicious URL to the victim via email, chat, or other means. When the victim clicks the link, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special position required:** The attacker does not need any special access or privileges on the server.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `ambulance-tracking.php` endpoint and the `searchdata` parameter.
*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to construct a URL that includes a malicious JavaScript payload.
