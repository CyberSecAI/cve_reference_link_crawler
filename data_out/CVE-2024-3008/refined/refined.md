Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formexeCommand` function of Tenda FH1205 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `formexeCommand` function copies the user-controlled `cmdinput` parameter to a fixed-size buffer (`v7`) using `strcpy`.
- The size of `v7` is 512 bytes.
- Lack of input validation or bounds checking on the `cmdinput` parameter before copying.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by overflowing the buffer.
- It could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted, although this is not explicitly stated.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/execCommand`.
- The `cmdinput` parameter within the POST request's cookie can be manipulated to send a payload that exceeds the buffer size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This implies the attacker needs network access to the device, or be able to perform cross-site request forgery.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/execCommand`) and the parameter (`cmdinput`).
- No authentication is mentioned, suggesting that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without prior authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda FH1205 V2.0.0.7(775).
- A Proof of Concept (POC) is provided in the form of a Python script that demonstrates how to trigger the overflow by sending a cookie with a long string as the value for the `cmdinput` parameter.
- The vulnerable code snippet `strcpy(v7, src);` is mentioned in the vulnerability details.
