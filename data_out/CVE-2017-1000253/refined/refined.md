### CVE-2017-1000253

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw exists in the Linux kernel's ELF executable loader. When loading Position Independent Executables (PIE), the loader may allow the data segment of the application to overwrite the stack memory area.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The kernel's `load_elf_binary()` function fails to properly account for the total size of the binary when allocating memory. This results in a memory mapping overlap, specifically with the application's data segment being mapped over its stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This memory overlap could lead to memory corruption and privilege escalation. An unprivileged local user with access to a SUID (or otherwise privileged) PIE binary can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation, requiring access to a vulnerable system and a SUID or otherwise privileged PIE binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to execute code on the target machine as an unprivileged user. They must also have access to or the ability to craft and use a vulnerable SUID or otherwise privileged PIE binary on the system.

The provided content also highlights that the vulnerability is not limited to PIEs with large data segments, due to how stack space and randomization interact, especially after the Stack Clash mitigations were implemented. It also provides a detailed analysis of the exploitation process and the different layouts of memory before and after the "Stack Clash" mitigations in the kernel. A particular exploit is shown as example, that works on CentOS 7.
