- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unfiltered parameter in the log file viewer allows for path traversal. Specifically, the `service` parameter of the `load-logfiles` function is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of user session tokens, which allows an attacker to hijack any user session, gaining access to their websites and data.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker can exploit the path traversal vulnerability through the `service` parameter in the `load-logfiles` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker, must have the ability to send requests to the vulnerable application.
