When performing an online tag generation to devices which communicate 
using the ControlLogix protocol, a machine-in-the-middle, or a device 
that is not configured correctly, could deliver a response leading to 
unrestricted or unregulated resource allocation. This could cause a 
denial-of-service condition and crash the Kepware application. By 
default, these functions are turned off, yet they remain accessible for 
users who recognize and require their advantages.
