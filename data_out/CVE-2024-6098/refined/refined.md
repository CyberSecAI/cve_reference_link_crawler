Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6098

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how PTC Kepware products handle online tag generation when communicating with devices using the ControlLogix protocol. A malicious actor, or a misconfigured device can send a crafted response during the online tag generation process, leading to excessive resource allocation on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:** The software does not properly limit or throttle the resources allocated during online tag generation when using the ControlLogix protocol. This could cause a denial-of-service condition and crash the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially crashing the Kepware application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Machine-in-the-middle attack:** An attacker positioned between the Kepware server and the target device can intercept and modify network traffic, sending a malicious response during online tag generation.
- **Compromised or misconfigured device:** A compromised or incorrectly configured device communicating with the Kepware server can also trigger the vulnerability by sending a malformed response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to the targeted system.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept or send network traffic between the Kepware server and a device utilizing the ControlLogix protocol.
- No authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**
- ThingWorx Kepware Server 8.0 to 6.16
- KEPServerEX 6.0.2107.0 to 6.16
- TOP Server 6.0.2107.0 to 6.16
- GE Industrial Gateway Server 7.610 to 7.616

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable functionality is turned off by default, however it remains accessible.
- The vulnerability is rated as a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.3 (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) and CVSS v4 score of 5.9 (AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).
- The vulnerability was reported by Sharon Brizinov and Vera Mens of Claroty Research - Team82.
- PTC recommends using a defense-in-depth approach and adhering to the Kepware Secure Deployment Guide to mitigate the vulnerability.
- CISA also provides recommendations for mitigating the risk, including minimizing network exposure, locating control system networks behind firewalls, and using secure remote access methods.
