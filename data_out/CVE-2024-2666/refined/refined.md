### Summary of Vulnerability Information for CVE-2024-2666

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of user-supplied attributes within the "Bullet List Widget" of the Premium Addons for Elementor plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts. This is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious scripts are saved in the database and executed when a user views or tries to edit the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, especially when they try to edit the content.
*   The injected script could potentially lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing user session cookies, leading to account takeover
    *   Redirecting users to phishing sites or sites hosting malware
    *   Modifying page content, including injecting advertising, defacing content or modifying data

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the **Bullet List Widget** of the Premium Addons for Elementor plugin.
*   An attacker injects malicious scripts by manipulating attributes through this widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least **contributor-level access** to the WordPress site.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of XSS and how to insert malicious code through user-supplied attributes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Premium Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including version 4.10.24.
*   The vulnerability has been patched in version 4.10.25.
*   The provided changelog link shows the vast amount of changed files in the update, however, it does not point to the specific code changes that remediated the XSS issue, only that the version containing the fix is 4.10.25
