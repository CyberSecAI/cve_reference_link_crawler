- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that will be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites. This is especially dangerous if the targeted user is an administrator, as it could lead to full site compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious URLs with XSS payloads in parameters such as `podcastName`, `podcastSlug`, and `title`, an attacker can inject scripts into the page that will be executed when a user visits the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious link to a victim. No authentication or special privileges are required. The victim must click the link for the script to execute.
