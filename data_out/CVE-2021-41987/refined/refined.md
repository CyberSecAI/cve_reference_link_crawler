Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41987:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies in the `base64Decode` function within `ScepRequest::parseRequest` in `/nova/lib/www/scep.p`.
* A miscalculation occurs during the Base64 decoding process when calculating the output buffer size. The formula `output_buffer_length = 3 * (input_buffer_length >> 2)` can result in an undersized buffer allocation. Specifically, when the input length is not a multiple of 4, the integer division (`>> 2` or `// 4`) will cause the buffer to be too small to hold the decoded data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The miscalculation in buffer allocation leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when the decoded data exceeds the allocated buffer's size. This allows an attacker to overwrite heap metadata, specifically chunk sizes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By carefully crafting the Base64 encoded payload, an attacker can trigger the heap overflow, overwrite a vtable pointer, and gain control of execution flow. This enables them to execute arbitrary shellcode on the vulnerable Mikrotik router.
* **Privilege Escalation:** The provided exploit leads to the attacker being able to log into the web service as an administrator without a password.
* **Device compromise**: The shellcode used in the exploit reboots the target device after deleting the `/nova/store/user.data` file.

**Attack vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/scep` endpoint.
* **Specifically, the payload structure is**
   `GET /scep/{scep_server_name}?operation=PKIOperation&message={} HTTP/1.1\r\n`, with the `message` parameter containing the malicious base64 encoded data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Mikrotik router, specifically its WAN interface, because the attack can be performed without authentication.
* **Knowledge of `scep_server_name`:** The attacker must know the path name `scep_server_name` to successfully exploit the vulnerability. This implies some prior information gathering or potentially social engineering.
* **Payload crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious Base64 encoded payload that triggers the overflow and contains the shellcode.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit has low stability (5-6% success rate), potentially due to ASLR and other factors. However, the watchdog process restarts the vulnerable service (`www`) after a crash, which prevents denial of service and allows for multiple attempts.
* The provided technical analysis is more detailed than the typical CVE description. It includes decompiled code snippets, exploit flow overview, and steps to trigger the exploit.
* The document mentions specific affected versions: `6.46.8`, `6.47.9`, and `6.47.10`, which could be helpful when assessing the scope of the vulnerability.
* The exploit uses heap spraying to improve success rate by creating a predictable heap layout.
* The exploit uses a ROP chain to control the execution flow to the attacker's shellcode after the heap overflow.
