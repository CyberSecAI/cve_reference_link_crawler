# Vulnerability Exposure & Notification on Mikrotik (CVE-2021-41987)

2022.03.01D39Share:
## Brief

In 2021, we discovered an open directory on Huapiâs C2. We found the source code contained an exploit aiming at Mikrotik routers. More specifically, our analysis found that the exploit would allow the attackers to send specially crafted payloads to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via WAN without any authentications. The targeted RouterOS products include mikrotik-tile-6.46.8, mikrotik-vm-64.8, and mikrotik-vm-6.48.TeamT5 alerted Mikrotik to patch this vulnerability upon discovery. The patch for this vulnerability was released on 2021/11/17 and can be downloaded from the official Mikrotik website. All affected organizations should update their RouterOS immediately to avoid actorsâ exploitation.HUAPI (aka BlackTech, Palmerworm, or PLEAD) has been active since 2007 and has been targeting Taiwan for over a decade. Huapiâs malwares are highly sophisticated, and some of them use unique anti-analysis packers. Some of Huapiâs malware utilized a modified RC4 algorithm to encrypt the malicious C2 communication. Huapi focused on governmental entities, technology or telecommunication industries, and think tanks. Our observation suggested that over half of the victims were governmental agencies in Taiwan, the United States, Japan, and South Korea.
### Attack vector

As a powerful and easy-to-use router, Mikrotik routerboard supports SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol), a service that was designed for simple certificate delivery. During transport, the binary data is encoded in Base64 via HTTP GET. Unfortunately, when processing the data from the payload, a miscalculation may occur if the payload is not properly formatted, potentially resulting in a Heap-based Buffer Overflow.The open directory we had discovered contained exploit code that targeted `mikrotik-tile-6.46.8`, `mikrotik-vm-64.8` and `mikrotik-vm-6.48`, along with their corresponding shellcode snippets. In the following sections, we will be analyzing the exploit code that was designed for `mikrotik-vm-6.46.8`.
#### Root cause analysis

By sending the following payload, we can cause the service `www` to crash and potentially trigger a Heap-based Buffer Overflow. `GET /scep/{scep_server_name}?operation=PKIOperation&message={} HTTP/1.1\r\n`The crash can be traced back to the function `base64Decode`, located under `ScepRequest::parseRequest` from `/nova/lib/www/scep.p`. When unpacking the Base64 request, the following code is used to calculate the output buffer size,`output_buffer_length = 3 * (input_buffer_length >> 2)`â¦which may cause a miscalculation of the output buffer, resulting in an insufficient memory allocation from `malloc`, leading to a heap overflow.![Mikrotik 1.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic1_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)
#### What happened?

For instance, we assume that the our input data is `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxhCE`, and the length of input buffer is 19. Based on the decompiled code, `out_len = 3 * (input_len >> 2)` which is `out_len = 3 * (input_len // 4)` (double slashes represent integer division), thereby allocating 12 bytes as decoded data buffer. However, the decoded data buffer should be 14 bytes instead of 12. This oversight allows the attacker to overwrite data in heap.
#### Overview of the exploit flow

According to the chunk-recycling mechanism, by overwriting the chunk size of a chunk in bins to a larger value (`0x4121`), the next `malloc` call will return a heap chunk overlapped with allocated chunks. This will lead to a heap overflow when writing to the chunk.The part which will be overwritten is a vtable pointer in a destructor (`sub_8052E90`) function, and by setting the register `edx` to `0x8061a74`, the instruction `call [edx+4]` will execute the gadget at `0x8058e89` ( `xchg eax, ebp; ret;` ) and execute the shellcode after pivoting the stack to the attacker-owned buffer.![Mikrotik 2.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic2_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)
#### Heap spray

The attacker can begin heap spraying by requesting 64 concurrent connections, and close some of them in order to let the vtable pointer be overwriten by the heap overflow later.![Mikrotik 3.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic3_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)The function `aaaa` assembles the ROP gadgets, and the variable `sc` contains the shellcode for execution.
![Mikrotik 4.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic4_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)
#### Trigger heap overflow

The function `bbbb` sends the payloads to the victim server in the aforementioned format.![Mikrotik 5.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic5_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)
![Mikrotik 6.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic6_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)The parameter message (`'x'*801*4+'hCE'`) in the function `bbbb` will overwrite the size of next chunk. Here in gdb , it shows that the parameter message has been decoded to `c7 1c 71 84 21` at `0x80859f0`, and the last byte `\x21` has been written as the next chunk size at `0x80859f4`.![Mikrotik 7.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic7_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)
#### Attempting to retrieve the oversized chunk on heap

![Mikrotik 8.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic8_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)In order to retrieve the overflowed chunk, we need to send out more request. At some point, the register `edx` will be set to `0x8061a74` when the attempt reaches `i=3`.![Mikrotik 9.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic9_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)
#### Trigger destructor

The final step of the exploit, set off destructor `call [edx+4]` by closing connections.
![Mikrotik 10.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic10_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)
#### Fingers crossed

Thanks to the heap spraying at the initial phase of the exploit, the data in the address `0x8061a74` will be modified, thus the instruction `call [edx+4]` will end up calling `0x8058e89` instead (the address of gadget `xchg eax, ebp; ret;`) and start executing our gadgets.![Mikrotik 11.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic11_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)Once the gadgets have been hit, `0x8058e89: xchg eax, ebp; ret` and `0x8052eb9: leave` will allow us to pivot from the stack to the controllable buffer and start to execute our ROP chain from `0x804fbfc`.The ROP chain will try to increase the address of `open` to the address of `mprotect`, and the `0x804fc04: pop esp; ret;` will set `esp` to `0x8061a74+8` to wrap up the ROP chain. Lastly, calling `mprotect` and jump right into the shellcode (`0x8061674`).![Mikrotik 12.png](https://uploads.teamt5.org/upload/original/pic12_vulnerability-mikrotik-cve-2021-41987.png)In the exploit, the shellcode can be interpreted as `unlink('/nova/store/user.data') + sync() + reboot()`, after the target device has finished rebooting. The attacker should then be able to login into web service as admin without a password.
### Conclusion

To wrap up, letâs go over the exploit code once again:**1. Low stability**

* Since `add()` does not work in our favor and that ASLR is enabled by default, the exploit chain may fail on the first try.
* Occasionally, even though the `/nova/store/user.dat` file will be deleted, the device does not end up rebooting. The shellcode may require extra improvements to make it more stable.
* Even in best case scenario, the success rate is only about 5~6%.
* Thankfully, in the event where the attack attempt fails, the watchdog process will restart the `www` service for us. This ensures stability and allows the attacker to not cause noticeable disruption during the attack.

**2. Strict prerequisites**

* The attacker must be aware of the path name `scep_server_name` before being able to begin such attack.

**3. Disclosure Timeline**`2021/07/11`: Acquire exploit codes from the open directory`2021/10/04`: Responsible disclosure to Mikrotik and reserved CVE-2021-41987`2021/11/17`: Official patch released`2022/03/01`: Full disclosure released**4. Affected versions of RouterOS**

* `6.46.8`
* `6.47.9`
* `6.47.10`
