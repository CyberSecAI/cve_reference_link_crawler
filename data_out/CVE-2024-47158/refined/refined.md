*   The scope of the vulnerability is "Changed" meaning that the exploit of the vulnerability in one component of the application may impact other components.
*   The impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are Low.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited via a Network (N) attack vector.
*   The application allows a student's device to send malicious input, which impacts the instructor's screen.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a "Low" privilege level within the application to inject malicious HTML.
*   No user interaction is required from the instructor to trigger the exploit (UI:N)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in N-LINE version 2.0.6 and prior versions. It has been fixed in version 2.0.7.
*   The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Ayato Shitomi of Fore-Z co.ltd.
