# Low-risk cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability linked to potential domain takeover

Low

GHSA-6v96-m24v-f58j
Aug 21, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 4.22.0, < 4.25.0-lts

## Patched versions

4.25.0-lts

## Description

### Affected Packages

The issue impacts only editor instances with enabled [version notifications](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-versionCheck).

Please note that this feature is disabled by default in all CKEditor 4 LTS versions. Therefore, if you use CKEditor 4 LTS, it is highly unlikely that you are affected by this vulnerability. If you are unsure, please contact us.

### Impact

A theoretical vulnerability has been identified in CKEditor 4.22 (and above). In a highly unlikely scenario where an attacker gains control over the <https://cke4.ckeditor.com> domain, they could potentially execute an attack on CKEditor 4 instances. Although the vulnerability is purely hypothetical, we have addressed it in CKEditor 4.25.0-lts to ensure compliance with security best practices.

### Patches

The issue has been recognized and patched. The fix is available in version 4.25.0-lts.

### For More Information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at security@cksource.com.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-43411

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
