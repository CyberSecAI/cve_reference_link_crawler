The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41010.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. The `sprintf` function is used to format strings into fixed-size stack buffers without proper bounds checking of the input parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) caused by using `sprintf` without proper bounds checking. The `DetranCLI` binary uses a command template system where several commands take parameters as input. These parameters are then used in `sprintf` calls to format strings into stack buffers. However, the size of the input parameters is not checked against the size of the target buffers, causing a buffer overflow if the input is too long.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary command execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is sending a specially crafted network packet to trigger the vulnerable `DetranCLI` commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device, which would require some form of network access and knowledge of the vulnerable commands and their syntax. The CVSS score indicates that the attacker would need high privileges on the target to exploit the vulnerability.

**Specific to CVE-2022-41010:**
The specific vulnerable command for CVE-2022-41010 is:

```
no port triger protocol (tcp|udp|tcp/udp) triger port <1-65535> forward port <1-65535> description WORD
```

And the vulnerable code snippet is:

```
sprintf(buff_0x80,"%d<%d<%s<%s<%s",1,based_on_argv[0],atoi_argv[1],atoi_argv[2],argv[3]);
```
This shows the `sprintf` function writing to `buff_0x80`, a buffer with a size of 0x80 bytes, using parameters from the command. If the `description` parameter (argv[3]) is longer than what `buff_0x80` can hold, then a buffer overflow will occur.
