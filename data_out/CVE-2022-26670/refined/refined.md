- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Specific fields on the D-Link DIR-878 router's web interface lack proper sanitization of special parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the router's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable router and does not need to be authenticated.
