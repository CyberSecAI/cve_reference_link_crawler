The above command is missing its backslash.  This triggers a crash:

printf '\e[4;65535;65535t'

and so does this:

printf '\e[8;65535;65535t'

The latter is a different escape sequence that accepts the sizes in
different units.  I hope the fix covers both, but I didn't review nor
test it - I hope someone does and posts in here.
