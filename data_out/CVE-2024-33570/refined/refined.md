Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function of the Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of sufficient access control mechanisms. This allows users with low privileges (like 'Subscriber') to potentially perform actions that should be restricted to higher-level users (like Administrators).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The specific impact varies, as it depends on the actions exposed through the vulnerable function. The provided text specifies a general description of broken access control, but not a specific exploitation scenario. However, it is noted to be of low severity and unlikely to be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerable function due to missing access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site, with the minimum required privilege being a 'Subscriber'.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 3.8.3 of the Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.8.4.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
- The vulnerability falls under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.
