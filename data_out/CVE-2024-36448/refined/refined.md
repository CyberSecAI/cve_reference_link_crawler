- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to SSRF, meaning it can be tricked into making requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially to internal resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially use the SSRF vulnerability to access internal resources or perform actions on behalf of the server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could manipulate the application into making requests to attacker-controlled or internal destinations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable application in such a way as to manipulate the destination of the server-side request, making the server initiate requests to unauthorized locations.
