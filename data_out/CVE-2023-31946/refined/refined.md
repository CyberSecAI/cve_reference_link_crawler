Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Type:** Unrestricted File Upload

**Root Cause:** The application lacks proper validation and sanitization of uploaded file names in `artical.php`. Specifically, the code directly uses the user-provided filename from `$_FILES['file']['name']` when saving the uploaded file and storing its path in the database, without any checks or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without validating their type or extension. This means an attacker can upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize the filename, allowing attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions (e.g., `.php`)
*   **Direct Use of User Input:** The code directly incorporates the user-provided filename into the file path and the database without validation.
* **Lack of Access Control:**  The uploaded file is stored in the `/uploaded/` directory which appears to be publicly accessible via the webserver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file and then execute it by directly accessing its URL. This could lead to complete compromise of the server.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could upload files that alter the website's content or appearance.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could use the RCE to gain access to sensitive data stored on the server, including the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Upload a malicious file:** An attacker uses the file upload form at `/Travel/admin/artical.php` to upload a PHP file (e.g., `shell.php`) containing malicious code.
2.  **Access the uploaded file:** After uploading, the attacker accesses the uploaded file directly via the web server using the predicted/known path at `/Travel/admin/uploaded/shell.php`.
3.  **Execute the code:**  The web server executes the malicious PHP code, allowing the attacker to perform arbitrary actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the admin interface, which is accessible via `/Travel/admin/artical.php`.
*   The attacker must be able to authenticate to the application as an admin user (username: admin, password: admin, per documentation) to access the vulnerable file upload functionality.
