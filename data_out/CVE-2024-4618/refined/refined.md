Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'url' attribute within the Team Member widget of the Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the 'url' field in the Team Member widget. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into pages that use the Team Member widget.
- **Account compromise:** When a user views a page containing the malicious script, the script will execute within their browser. This could potentially lead to actions being performed on the victim's behalf, including session hijacking, credential stealing, or other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker must be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker can then inject malicious JavaScript code through the 'url' field of the Team Member widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress site with a role of Contributor or higher.
- **Elementor editing access:** The attacker must be able to edit pages using the Elementor page builder.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.9.7 of the plugin.
- The provided changeset shows that the fix included the use of `sanitize_url()` function on the image URL.
- The vulnerable code is located in `exclusive-addons-for-elementor/trunk/elements/team-member/team-member.php`
- The vulnerable parameter is `exad_team_members_cta_btn_link.url` which was not sanitized before version 2.6.9.7.
- This vulnerability is also present in the `exad_team_member_image.url`, `exad_magnify_image.url`, `exad_testimonial_image.url`, and `exad_tooltip_img_content.url` parameters.
