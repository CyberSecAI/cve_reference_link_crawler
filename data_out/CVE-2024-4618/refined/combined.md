I am currently using version 2.6.9.2, where relative URLs are functioning correctly when applied to entire columns. However, after updating to version 2.6.9.3, I noticed that relative URLs no longer work, although absolute URLs do.I’ve now upgraded to the latest version, 2.6.9.4, and the issue with relative URLs persists, while absolute URLs continue to work as expected.

I love this plugin! It adds a ton of features to Elementor without needing Elementor Pro. The free version has a lot, but I got Exclusive Addons Pro with a lot more widgets, and it’s definitely worth the price. The widgets are great, but also it comes with a bunch of premade blocks and pages, that will save time – just what I needed!

### Description

The Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Team Member widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.9.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied 'url' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
