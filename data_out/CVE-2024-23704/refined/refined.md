Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23704:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `WifiDialogActivity` within the Android Settings app. It appears that the activity could be shown to the user even when the user has restrictions that disallow adding new Wi-Fi configurations (`DISALLOW_ADD_WIFI_CONFIG`). This suggests an improper access control or permission check within the `WifiDialogActivity`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper permission handling. The `WifiDialogActivity` is displayed even when the user is not supposed to create new WiFi configurations, which indicates an improper check or lack thereof for the `DISALLOW_ADD_WIFI_CONFIG` restriction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** As stated in the bulletin, this vulnerability could lead to a local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. Although the specific escalation of privilege is not described here, the implication is that a user with restricted Wi-Fi configuration permissions could bypass those restrictions and potentially add or modify Wi-Fi configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker, specifically a user on the device, can trigger the display of the `WifiDialogActivity` even if they are restricted from adding Wi-Fi configurations. This could involve navigating through the settings or through an intent that launches this activity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user on the device. They would need to have access to the settings or the ability to launch the specific activity through intent or some other way. They would also need the `DISALLOW_ADD_WIFI_CONFIG` restriction enabled in their user profile or device configuration.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix involves restricting the `WifiDialogActivity` to not be shown if the user has `DISALLOW_ADD_WIFI_CONFIG` set.
- This vulnerability is categorized as "High" severity and applies to Android 13 and 14.
- The commit [A-299931761](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/%2B/2e90322bab7de1deaf3c82e207bf4404b92743d7) addresses this vulnerability.
