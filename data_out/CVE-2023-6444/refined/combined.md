## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Seriously Simple Podcasting < 3.0.0 - Unauthenticated Administrator Email Disclosure

### Description

The plugin discloses the Podcast owner's email address (which by default is the admin email address) via an unauthenticated crafted request.

This was fixed in 3.0.0 for new plugin installation, however when upgrading, users will have to unset the "Owner email address" in the Feed Details settings

### Proof of Concept

View the source of the page below and notice the email being disclosed:
https://example.com/?feed=itunes
