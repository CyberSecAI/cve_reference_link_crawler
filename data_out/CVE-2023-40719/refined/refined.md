- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the use of hardcoded credentials within the fmgsvrd service of FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hardcoded credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain access to Fortinet dummy testing data. This constitutes an information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves using the hardcoded credentials to access the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position where they can leverage the hardcoded credentials to access the dummy testing data. The CVSS score indicates that the attacker would need a local or high privileged access to exploit the vulnerability.
