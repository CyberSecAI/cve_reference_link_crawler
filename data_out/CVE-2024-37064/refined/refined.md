{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `read_pandas` function in `src/ydata_profiling/utils/dataframe.py` uses `pd.read_pickle` to load serialized pandas datasets when the file extension is `.pkl` or `.pickle`. The python pickle module is inherently insecure and can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the user's system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious pickle file is crafted and loaded using the `read_pandas` function, either directly through code or indirectly through command line tools."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious pickle file and convince the victim to load it using the vulnerable function."
  },
