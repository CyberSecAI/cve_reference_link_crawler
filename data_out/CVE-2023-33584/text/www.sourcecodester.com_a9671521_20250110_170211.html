The Enrollment System using PHP/MySQL is a project to manage the record of enrolled students of a certain school. This project was developed using HTML5, CSS, PHP, JavaScript (jQuery / Ajax) and Bootstrap for the design.

## About

The Enrollment System project manages the records of the enrolled students of a certain school. The system can only be managed by the admin users, which means students and faculties do not have any access to this record. The system admins will create the academic year to organize the enrollment records. By setting the academic year as default to the system, all enrolled student records that can be found will be based on the default academic year. This system is easy to modify to create more features such as creating a tracking record view for the record of the student per academic year.

## Features

* **Dashboard Page** - This is the welcome page of the admin after logging in to the system. On this page, the Total numbers of enrolled students and faculties are displayed as the summary of the system records.
* **Academic Yea**r - This page is located under Academic navigation. This is where the academic year or school year is listed and being managed.
* **Level and Section** - This page is located under Academic navigation. This is where you can create, edit, and delete grade level and section.
* **Faculty Page** - On this page, the list of advisers are displayed and their handled grade level and section. This is where an admin sets an adviser for the class.
* **Student List** - This is the page where enrolled students are listed filtered by the default academic year. Also, on this page, the admin can enroll students.
* **System Settings Page** - This is the page where the admin will set the school details. On this page, the admin can dynamically change the system info such as the school name, address, and logo.

## Installation

2. Download or set up any local web server that runs a PHP script.
