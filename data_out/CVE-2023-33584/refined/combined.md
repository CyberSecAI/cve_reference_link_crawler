# Enrollment System Project with Source Code Using PHP/MySQL

Submitted by [oretnom23](/users/tips23 "View user profile.") on Sunday, September 13, 2020 - 18:25.

The Enrollment System using PHP/MySQL is a project to manage the record of enrolled students of a certain school. This project was developed using HTML5, CSS, PHP, JavaScript (jQuery / Ajax) and Bootstrap for the design.

## About

The Enrollment System project manages the records of the enrolled students of a certain school. The system can only be managed by the admin users, which means students and faculties do not have any access to this record. The system admins will create the academic year to organize the enrollment records. By setting the academic year as default to the system, all enrolled student records that can be found will be based on the default academic year. This system is easy to modify to create more features such as creating a tracking record view for the record of the student per academic year.

## Features

* **Dashboard Page** - This is the welcome page of the admin after logging in to the system. On this page, the Total numbers of enrolled students and faculties are displayed as the summary of the system records.
* **Academic Yea**r - This page is located under Academic navigation. This is where the academic year or school year is listed and being managed.
* **Level and Section** - This page is located under Academic navigation. This is where you can create, edit, and delete grade level and section.
* **Faculty Page** - On this page, the list of advisers are displayed and their handled grade level and section. This is where an admin sets an adviser for the class.
* **Student List** - This is the page where enrolled students are listed filtered by the default academic year. Also, on this page, the admin can enroll students.
* **System Settings Page** - This is the page where the admin will set the school details. On this page, the admin can dynamically change the system info such as the school name, address, and logo.

## Installation

1. Download the source code and extract the **zip**file.
2. Download or set up any local web server that runs a PHP script.
3. Open web server database and create a new database name it **enrollment\_db**.
4. Import the **SQL** file located in the database folder of the source code.
5. Copy and paste the source code to the location where your local web server accessing your local projects. example for XAMPP('C:\xampp\htdocs')
6. Open a web browser and browse the project. e.g [ http://localhost/enrollment-system-using-php ]

## Default Admin Access:

**Username: admin**

**Password: admin123**

Feel free to download and modify the project. I hope his project will cater your needs for development or can help you with what you are looking for.

# Exploit Title: Enrollment System Project v1.0 - SQL Injection Authentication Bypass (SQLI)
# Date of found: 18/05/2023
# Exploit Author: VIVEK CHOUDHARY @sudovivek
# Version: V1.0
# Tested on: Windows 10
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.sourcecodester.com
# Software Link: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14444/enrollment-system-project-source-code-using-phpmysql.html
# CVE: CVE-2023-33584
# CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-33584

Vulnerability Description -

	Enrollment System Project V1.0, developed by Sourcecodester, has been found to be vulnerable to SQL Injection (SQLI) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application. The system fails to properly validate user-supplied input in the username and password fields during the login process, enabling an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.

Steps to Reproduce -

	The following steps outline the exploitation of the SQL Injection vulnerability in Enrollment System Project V1.0:

	    1.	Launch the Enrollment System Project V1.0 application.

	    2.	Open the login page by accessing the URL: http://localhost/enrollment/login.php.

	    3.	In the username and password fields, insert the following SQL Injection payload shown inside brackets to bypass authentication: {' or 1=1 #}.

	    4.	Click the login button to execute the SQL Injection payload.

As a result of successful exploitation, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the system and is logged in with administrative privileges.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Vulnerability Description -

Enrollment System Project V1.0, developed by Sourcecodester, has been found to be vulnerable to SQL Injection (SQLI) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application. The system fails to properly validate user-supplied input in the username and password fields during the login process, enabling an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Exploit Title:** Enrollment System Project v1.0 - SQL Injection Authentication Bypass (SQLI)

**Exploit Author:** VIVEK CHOUDHARY @sudovivek

**Vendor Homepage:** <https://www.sourcecodester.com>

**Software Link:** <https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14444/enrollment-system-project-source-code-using-phpmysql.html>

**Tested on:** Windows 10

**CVE:** CVE-2023-33584

**CVE URL:** <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-33584>

## Steps to Reproduce -

1. Launch the Enrollment System Project V1.0 application.
2. Open the login page by accessing the URL: <http://localhost/enrollment/login.php>.
3. In the username and password fields, insert the following SQL Injection payload shown inside brackets to bypass authentication: {`' or 1=1 #`}.
4. Click the login button to execute the SQL Injection payload.
