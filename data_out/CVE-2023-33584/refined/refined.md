Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-33584

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the username and password fields of the login form in the "Enrollment System Project v1.0". This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code into the database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLI): The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the failure to sanitize user-supplied input in the username and password fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: A successful SQL injection allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the system with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is through the login form of the web application, specifically the username and password fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable web application, typically through a web browser, and they do not need any prior access or authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker can use the following payload in both username and password fields: `' or 1=1 #`
- By submitting this payload, the SQL query constructed will always evaluate to true, granting access without valid credentials

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit was tested on Windows 10.
- The vulnerable application is the "Enrollment System Project v1.0" developed by Sourcecodester.
- The specific vulnerable login page is `http://localhost/enrollment/login.php`
