# Arbitrary code execution when checking out an attacker-controlled Git branch

High

[me-and](/me-and)
published
GHSA-rmp3-wq55-f557
Apr 24, 2021

## Package

git
(Cygwin)

## Affected versions

<=2.31.1-1

## Patched versions

2.31.1-2

## Description

### Impact

A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files with backslash characters in the file name may cause Git to overwrite arbitrary files when checking out a repository using Git on Cygwin. In particular, this would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as soon as the repository is checked out.

### Patches

The problem is patched in the Cygwin Git v2.31.1-2 release.

At time of writing, the vulnerability is present in the upstream Git source code; any Cygwin user who compiles Git for themselves from upstream sources should manually apply a patch to mitigate the vulnerability: <https://github.com/cygporter/git/blob/v2.31.1-2/check-backslash-safety.patch>

### Workarounds

You should not clone or pull from repositories from untrusted sources.

* [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/cygporter/git/security/advisories/GHSA-rmp3-wq55-f557)
* [CVE-2019-1354](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-xjx4-8694-q2fq) was an equivalent vulnerability in Git for Windows and Git for Visual Studio.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* For public questions specifically relating to Git on Cygwin, contact the Cygwin mailing list (details at <http://cygwin.com/ml>)
* For public questions relating to Git in general, contact the Git mailing list (details at <https://git-scm.com/community>)
* To disclose further vulnerabilities privately, contact the Git-security list by emailing git-security@googlegroups.com

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Hi folks,

I don't typically announce Cygwin releases of Git on this mailing
list, but this one's for a security vulnerability, and in particular
I'd like to catch the (hopefully very small number of) people who use
Git on Cygwin compiling it themselves.

I've just uploaded version 2.31.1-2 of Git to the Cygwin distribution
server, and it will be being distributed to the Cygwin mirrors over
the next few hours.

This update addresses CVE-2021-29468, which would cause Git to
overwrite arbitrary files with attacker-controlled contents when
checking out content from a malicious repository, and in particular
would allow an attacker to overwrite Git hooks to execute arbitrary
code.

Having discussed with the Git security list, I believe there are very
few people compiling Git on Cygwin themselves, and therefore agreed to
release the patched Cygwin build without yet having a patch in the
main Git source code. However if you do use a version of Git on Cygwin
that isn't from the official Cygwin distribution servers, I'd strongly
recommend either not checking out or cloning from any untrusted
repositories until you've applied at least the functional part of the
patch I'll be submitting shortly.

I'd like to thank RyotaK (<https://github.com/Ry0taK> /
<https://twitter.com/ryotkak>) for finding and responsibly disclosing
this vulnerability, and Johannes Schindelin for helping manage the
response.

Kind regards,

Adam

Hi folks,

Version 2.31.1-2 of Git has been uploaded and should be coming soon to
a mirror near you.

This update addresses CVE-2021-29468, which would cause Git to
overwrite arbitrary files with attacker-controlled contents when
checking out content from a malicious repository, and in particular
would allow an attacker to overwrite Git hooks to execute arbitrary
code.

This vulnerability is present on all Cygwin Git versions prior to
v2.31.1-2. Until you have that release, the best mitigation is to not
clone or check out from any untrusted Git repositories.

There is a small amount of additional information in the GitHub
Security Advisory at
<https://github.com/me-and/Cygwin-Git/security/advisories/GHSA-rmp3-wq55-f557>

If you compile Git on Cygwin yourself, there is currently no upstream
patch that addresses the vulnerability. Until there is, I would
recommend applying the preliminary patch at
<https://github.com/me-and/Cygwin-Git/blob/main/check-backslash-safety.patch>

I'd like to thank RyotaK (<https://github.com/Ry0taK> /
<https://twitter.com/ryotkak>) for finding and responsibly disclosing
this vulnerability, and Johannes Schindelin for helping manage the
response.

Kind regards,

Adam
