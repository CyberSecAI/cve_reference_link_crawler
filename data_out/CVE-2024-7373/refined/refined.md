Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7373 (Note: Although the provided text does not explicitly mention CVE-2024-7373, it describes a SQL injection vulnerability. Since the description of the CVE is a placeholder, it is assumed the described vulnerability is the target of this CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application fails to sanitize user input passed through the `id` parameter in the POST request to `/ajax.php?action=load_answered`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation, meaning an attacker could potentially gain elevated access within the system.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to read, modify, or delete data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `/ajax.php?action=load_answered`, including malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, specifically the `/ajax.php` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to identify the `id` parameter as a vulnerable input.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Simple Realtime Quiz System" by SourceCodester.
- The vulnerable endpoint is `/ajax.php?action=load_answered`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The provided `sqlmap` command demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The POST request data shows an example of a request with the `id` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (POC) using `sqlmap` and a sample HTTP request.
- The `sqlmap` command in the POC includes options for banner grabbing, which can help the attacker gather more information about the database, and flushing the session, which can improve the testing process by clearing previous session data.
