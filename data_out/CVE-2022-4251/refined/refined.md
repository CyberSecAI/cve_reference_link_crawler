{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application directly stores user-provided input into the database without any sanitization, and later outputs this data to the page without encoding.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected content. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript via a specific input field (likely when editing booking details). This input is then stored in the database.",
       "When a user views the relevant pages (e.g., booking details in `view.php`), the malicious script stored in the database is output to the page without proper encoding."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the 'editBooking' functionality to inject malicious code and a user to view the page where the stored payload is displayed."
