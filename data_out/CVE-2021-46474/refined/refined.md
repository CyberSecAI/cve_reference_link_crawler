- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `jsiEvalCodeSub` function in `src/jsiEval.c` at line 1366.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs during the execution of the `jsiEvalCodeSub` function when evaluating code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided output shows that the program crashed with an AddressSanitizer error, indicating memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by evaluating crafted JavaScript code, specifically involving the use of `eval` within a function in strict mode and an object property access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `jsish` interpreter to execute the malicious JavaScript code.

The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description, including the exact code location of the bug, a test case, and the full output from AddressSanitizer showing the memory corruption.
