- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user arguments passed to specific CLI commands in Cisco IOS XR Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied input to CLI commands. This can lead to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker with a low-privileged account to obtain read/write file system access on the underlying operating system, potentially escalating privileges to *root*.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, through the command-line interface (CLI) of the affected Cisco IOS XR software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an existing low-privileged account on the affected device to craft and execute malicious CLI commands.
