The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Event Registration System.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `username` and `password` parameters within the login functionality. The application does not properly sanitize or parameterize these inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Compromise of the application: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application.
- Data access and modification: Attackers can access sensitive data or modify existing records in the database.
- Potential for further exploitation: With control of the database, an attacker can potentially leverage further vulnerabilities in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to `/event/classes/Login.php?f=rlogin`.
- Injection parameters: The `username` and `password` POST parameters are the injection points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the application.
- Knowledge of SQL Injection: The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- Burp Suite or similar tools: The attacker will typically use tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- SQLMap: The attacker uses SQLMap to automate the SQL injection process.
