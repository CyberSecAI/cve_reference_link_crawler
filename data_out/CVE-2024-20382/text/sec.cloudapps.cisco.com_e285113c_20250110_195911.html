These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input to application endpoints. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to follow a link designed to submit malicious input to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or script code in the browser in the context of the web services page.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-xss-yjj7ZjVq>  This advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of the following Cisco software:    + ASA Software with Cisco AnyConnect VPN or Clientless SSL VPN enabled   + FTD Software with Cisco AnyConnect VPN enabled For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Cisco ASA Software Configuration To determine whether Cisco ASA Software has a vulnerable feature enabled, use the **show-running-config** CLI command. In the following table, the left column lists vulnerable Cisco ASA Software features. The right column indicates the basic configuration for each feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. A device is affected by these vulnerabilities if it is running a vulnerable release and has one of these features enabled.       | Cisco ASA Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable client-services port |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Clientless SSL VPN | webvpn enable |      Determine the Cisco FTD Software Configuration To determine whether Cisco FTD Software has a vulnerable feature enabled, use the **show-running-config** CLI command. In the following table, the left column lists vulnerable Cisco FTD Software features. The right column indicates the basic configuration for each feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. A device is affected by these vulnerabilities if it is running a vulnerable release and has one of these features enabled.       | Cisco FTD Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Remote Access (with client services)1,2 | crypto ikev2 enable client-services port |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN1,2 | webvpn enable |      1. Remote Access VPN features were introduced in Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2.   2. To enable Remote Access VPN features in Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC), formerly Firepower Management Center Software, choose **Devices > VPN > Remote Access**. To enable Remote Access VPN features in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), choose **Remote Access VPN**.      Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco FMC Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5. Click **Check**.
