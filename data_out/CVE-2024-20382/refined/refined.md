- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input to application endpoints within the VPN web client services of Cisco ASA and FTD software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code in the browser within the context of the web services page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can persuade a user to follow a link that submits malicious input to the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a user to click it. No authentication is needed.
