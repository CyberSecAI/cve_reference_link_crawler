    "summary": "The vulnerability is due to a symlink attack vulnerability in pmpost. An attacker with a compromised PCP user account can exploit this vulnerability by creating a symlink in `/var/log/pcp` to coerce pmpost to write arbitrary files with arbitrary content with root user privileges. This could be leveraged to overwrite critical system files and escalate privileges.",

      "Creation of a malicious symlink in the `/var/log/pcp` directory by an attacker with a compromised PCP user account.",
