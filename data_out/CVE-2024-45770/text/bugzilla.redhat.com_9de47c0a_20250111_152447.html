| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-09-06 17:17:49 UTC  ``` This issue is somewhat similar to [CVE-2023-6917](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6917) from a previous audit.  `pmpost` is used to append messages to the "PCP notice board". It is called from different contexts, one of which is as `root` from within the `pmcd` startup script. The program writes the message provided on the command line to the file in /var/log/pcp/NOTICES.  The directory /var/log/pcp belongs to pcp:pcp. The file is opened without passing the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag, thus it will open symlinks placed there by the pcp user. This would allow `pmpost` to be coerced into creating new files in arbitrary locations, or to corrupt arbitrary existing files in the system.  Furthermore, if the NOTICES file is newly created and `pmpost` runs as root, then a `fchown()` to pcp:pcp is executed on the file. Thus it allows to pass the ownership of arbitrary newly created files in the system to pcp:pcp.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 11:31:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2024:6846 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6846](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6846)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 11:37:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:6840 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6840](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6840)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 11:39:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:6843 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6843](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6843)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 11:48:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:6837 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6837](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6837)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 12:11:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:6842 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6842](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6842)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 12:11:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:6844 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6844](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6844)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 12:12:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:6847 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6847](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6847)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 12:12:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:6848 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6848](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6848)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2310451#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-12 11:11:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9452 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9452](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9452)   ``` |  |
