**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the `getMacAddressByIP` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before passing it to a system call, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- Lack of Authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- Full System Control: The code is executed with SYSTEM privileges, giving the attacker complete control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- User-supplied Input: The attack is triggered by supplying a malicious string to the vulnerable function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- No Authentication: No authentication is required, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.
