Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-9855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of predictable "grid guard" codes for a secondary installer authentication system in SMA inverters. A single, predictable code can be used on any SMA inverter when combined with the installer account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Codes:** The grid guard codes used for installer authentication are predictable, making them vulnerable to guessing or pre-calculation.
- **Lack of Uniqueness:** The same grid guard code can be used across different SMA inverters, meaning that if an attacker discovers one, it is potentially valid for many devices.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The combination of the installer account and the grid guard code provides access to sensitive parameters, implying insufficient access control and privilege separation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full Device Compromise:** An attacker who obtains a valid grid guard code combined with the installer account can change sensitive parameters, potentially leading to full device compromise.
- **Denial of Service:** Modification of device parameters could lead to a denial of service.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability allows for the escalation of privileges by granting access to sensitive settings.
- **Information Disclosure:** Access to sensitive parameters may lead to the disclosure of confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the SMA inverter.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs to send specially crafted packets over the network to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Internet Exploitation:** If the inverter is directly connected to the internet, or reachable via NAT, the attack can be carried out remotely via the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to communicate with the SMA inverter on the network.
- **Grid Guard Code:**  The attacker needs to obtain a valid, predictable grid guard code.
- **Installer Account Access:** The attacker also needs some level of access to the installer account.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, specifically in describing the predictability of the grid guard codes and the impact of their use across multiple devices.
- The content clearly states that the vulnerability affects all SMA inverters.
- The vulnerability has been confirmed by the vendor.
- It is noted that this CVE can be used as part of the "horus scenario".
