- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer copy operation without proper size checking ('Classic Buffer Overflow') exists within the `libjansson` component. This vulnerability is present in the Synology Camera firmware's implementation and not in the upstream library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Classic Buffer Overflow due to lack of input size validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the affected devices.
- **Attack vectors**: Unspecified vectors that exploit the buffer overflow in `libjansson`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker without prior authentication is required to exploit.
