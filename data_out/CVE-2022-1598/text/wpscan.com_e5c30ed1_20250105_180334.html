## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WPQA < 5.5 - Unauthenticated Private Message Disclosure

### Description

The plugin which is a companion to the Discy and Himer themes, lacks authentication in a REST API endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to discover private questions sent between users on the site.

### Proof of Concept

Visit /wp-json/wp/v2/asked-question
or /wp-json/wp/v2/asked-question/<iD> (where ID is numeric and can be bruteforced!)
