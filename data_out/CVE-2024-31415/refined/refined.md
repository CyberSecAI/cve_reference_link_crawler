- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The keys used for encrypting server configurations were insecurely stored on the host machine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially change or remove the server configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the host machine is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) and local access to the host machine where Foreseer is installed.
