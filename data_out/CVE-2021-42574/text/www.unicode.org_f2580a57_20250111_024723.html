([Announcement](http://blog.unicode.org/2021/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-140.html)) *Version 14.0.0 has been superseded by the [latest version](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/) of the Unicode Standard.*  This page summarizes the important changes for the Unicode Standard, Version 14.0.0. This version supersedes all previous versions of the Unicode Standard.  A. [Summary](#Summary) B. [Technical Overview](#Technical_Overview) C. [Stability Policy Update](#Stability_Policy) D. [Textual Changes and Character Additions](#Character_Additions) E. [Conformance Changes](#Conformance_Changes) F. [Changes in the Unicode Character Database](#Database_Changes) G. [Changes in the Unicode Standard Annexes](#UAX_Changes) H. [Changes in Synchronized Unicode Technical Standards](#UTS_Changes) M. [Implications for Migration](#Migration) A. Summary Unicode 14.0 adds 838 characters, for a total of 144,697 characters. These additions include [5 new scripts](#New_Scripts), for a total of 159 scripts, as well as 37 new emoji characters.  The new scripts and characters in Version 14.0 add support for lesser-used languages and unique written requirements worldwide, including numerous symbols additions. Funds from the [Adopt-a-Character](https://www.unicode.org/consortium/adopt-a-character.html) program provided support for some of these additions. The new scripts and characters include:   * Toto, used to write the Toto language in northeast India * Cypro-Minoan, an undeciphered historical script primarily used on the island of Cyprus * Vithkuqi, an historic script used to write Albanian, and undergoing a modern revival * Old Uyghur, an historic script used in Central Asia and elsewhere to write Turkic, Chinese, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Arabic languages * Tangsa, a modern script used to write the Tangsa language, which is spoken in India and Myanmar * Many Latin additions for extended IPA * Arabic script additions used to write languages across Africa and in Iran,   Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Java, and Bosnia, and to write honorifics,   and additions for Quranic use * Other character additions support languages of North America and of the Philippines, India, and Mongolia   Popular symbol additions:   * 37 emoji characters. For complete statistics regarding all emoji as of   Unicode 14.0, see   [Emoji Counts](https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts-14.0/emoji-counts.html).   For more information about emoji additions in version 14.0, including new   emoji ZWJ sequences and emoji modifier sequences, see   [Emoji Recently Added, v14.0](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-14.0/emoji-released.html).   Other symbol and notational additions include:   * The som currency sign used in the Kyrgyz Republic * Znamenny musical notation used to write Znamenny Chant, a form of liturgical singing that developed in Russia in the 11th century CE. It is derived from early Byzantine musical notation and is mainly of scholarly interest.   Support for CJK unified ideographs was enhanced in Version 14.0 by significant corrections and improvements to the Unihan database. Changes to the Unihan database include updated source lists, regular expressions, and new and updated fields. See [UAX #38, Unicode Han Database (Unihan)](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/tr38-31.html) for more information on the updates.  Additional support for lesser-used languages and scholarly work was extended, including:   * Ahom, Balinese, Brahmi, Canadian aboriginal languages (UCAS), Glagolitic, Kaithi, Kannada, Mongolian, Tagalog, Takri, and Telugu * Arabic support for Hausa, Wolof, Hindko, and Punjabi, and Ethiopic support for Gurage   Important chart font updates, including:   * CJK auxiliary blocks and enclosed alphanumerics. See the [delta charts](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-14.0/) for detailed information on significant chart font changes.  Synchronization Several other important Unicode specifications have been updated for Version 14.0. The following four Unicode Technical Standards are versioned in synchrony with the Unicode Standard, because their data files cover the same repertoire. All have been updated to Version 14.0:   * [UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/tr10-45.html) — sorting Unicode text * [UTS #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/tr39-24.html) — reducing Unicode spoofing * [UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/tr46-27.html) — compatible processing of non-ASCII URLs * [UTS #51, Unicode Emoji](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-21.html) — emoji-related data and behavior   Some of the changes in Version 14.0 and associated Unicode Technical Standards may require modifications to implementations. For more information, see the migration and modification sections of UTS #10, UTS #39, UTS #46, and UTS #51.  See Sections D through H below for additional details regarding the changes in this version of the Unicode Standard, its associated annexes, and the other synchronized Unicode specifications. B. Technical Overview Version 14.0 of the Unicode Standard consists of:   * The core specification * The code charts (delta and archival) for this version * The Unicode Standard Annexes * The Unicode Character Database (UCD)   The core specification gives the general principles, requirements for conformance, and guidelines for implementers. The code charts show representative glyphs for all the Unicode characters. The Unicode Standard Annexes supply detailed normative information about particular aspects of the standard. The Unicode Character Database supplies normative and informative data for implementers to allow them to implement the Unicode Standard. Core Specification The core specification is available as a [single pdf for viewing](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/UnicodeStandard-14.0.pdf). (14 MB) Links are also available in the navigation bar on the left of this page to access [individual chapters](#Chapters_nb) and [appendices](#Appendices_nb) of the core specification. It is also available as Print-on-Demand (POD) for purchase: [Volume 1](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/unicode-consortium/the-unicode-standard-version-140-volume-1/paperback/product-p8674j.html%20) and [Volume 2](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/unicode-consortium/the-unicode-standard-version-140-volume-2/paperback/product-q46246.html). Code Charts Several sets of code charts are available. They serve different purposes:   * The [latest set of code charts](https://www.unicode.org/charts/) for   the Unicode Standard is available online. Those charts are always the most current   code charts available, and may be updated at any time. The charts are organized by   scripts and blocks for easy reference.   An online [index by character name](https://www.unicode.org/charts/charindex.html)   is also provided. The [Tableaux des caractères](https://www.unicode.org/charts/fr/)   provides a French translation of these latest code charts.   For Unicode 14.0.0 in particular two additional sets of code chart pages are provided:   * A [set of delta code charts](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-14.0/) showing the   new blocks and any blocks in which characters were added for Unicode 14.0.0. The new characters are visually highlighted in the charts. * A [set of archival code charts](https://www.unicode.org/Public/14.0.0/charts/) that represents   the entire set of characters, names and representative glyphs at the time of publication of Unicode 14.0.0.   A [French translation](https://www.unicode.org/Public/14.0.0/charts/fr/) of the archival code charts is also available for this version.   The delta and archival code charts are a stable part of this release of the Unicode Standard. They will never be updated.  The old, frozen UCS2003 source column has been removed from the multi-column display for CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B for Version 14.0.0. For permanent reference, a [single source display of UCS2003](https://www.unicode.org/Public/13.0.0/charts/UCS2003.pdf) (8.7 MB) for the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B has been provided as part of the Version 13.0.0 archival charts. Unicode Standard Annexes Links to the individual [Unicode Standard Annexes](#Unicode_Standard_Annexes_nb) are available in the navigation bar on the left of this page. The list of significant changes in the content of the Unicode Standard Annexes for Version 14.0 can be found in [Section G](#UAX_Changes) below. Unicode Character Database [Data files](https://www.unicode.org/Public/14.0.0/) for Version 14.0 of the Unicode Character Database are available. The ReadMe.txt in that directory provides a roadmap to the functions of the various subdirectories. [Zipped versions](https://www.unicode.org/Public/zipped/14.0.0/) of the UCD for bulk download are available, as well. Version References Version 14.0.0 of the Unicode Standard should be referenced as:  The Unicode Consortium. *The Unicode Standard, Version 14.0.0*, (Mountain View, CA: The Unicode Consortium, 2021.

Implications for Migration There are a significant number of changes in Unicode 14.0 which may impact implementations upgrading to Version 14.0 from earlier versions of the standard. The most important of these are listed and explained here, to help focus on the issues most likely to cause unexpected trouble during upgrades. Script-related Changes Five new scripts have been added in Unicode 14.0.0. Some of these scripts have particular attributes which may cause issues for implementations. The more important of these attributes are summarized here.   * Old Uyghur is an abjad, historically related to Sogdian. Representation   of Old Uyghur text poses many significant issues. See the original proposal   documentation in [L2/20-191](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20191-old-uyghur.pdf)   for an extensive discussion.  Casing Issues  * Four new Latin case pairs and one new Glagolitic case pair have been added   in Version 14.0.0. In addition, one of the newly added scripts, Vithkuqi,   is a bicameral script with casing. Implementations   of case mapping and case folding should be checked to ensure they account   correctly for the new case pairs.  Numeric Property Issues  * A new set of decimal digits has been added for the Tangsa script.   See U+16AC0..U+16AC9. Implementations of digits will need to take those   into account.  CJK/Unihan Changes  * A new provisional property, kStrange, has been added to Unihan.   This property is documented in detail in a new Unicode Technical   Note, [UTN #43](https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn43/). * The provisional kCantonese property was extensively refined.   This work included 6,000 additional property values, as well as changing the property   values for nearly 5,000 existing ideographs to reflect only one reading. * Over 1,000 kIRG\_VSource property values with "VU-"" prefix were changed   to use the "VN-" prefix. * WARNING: There are changes to the ends of three existing   CJK unified ideograph ranges in Unicode 14.0.0. Because implementations often hard-code   ideographic ranges to short-cut lookups and reduce table sizes, it is   especially important that implementers pay close attention to the   implications of range changes for Version 14.0.0. These extensions bump up the end   ranges of the encoded ideographs by a few code points within each block:    + 3 code points for the [URO](https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#URO):     ending at U+9FFF [fills the block]   + 2 code points for Extension B: ending at U+2A6DF [fills the block]   + 4 code points for Extension C: ending at U+2B738 See [Section 4.4,   *Listing of Characters Covered by the Unihan Database*](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/tr38-31.html#BlockListing)   in UAX #38   for the version history of all these small CJK unified ideograph additions   inside existing blocks.   See [UAX #38](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/tr38-31.html), Unicode Han Database (Unihan) for further details on these changes, especially Section 4.2, *Listing by Date of Addition to the Unicode Standard*, and Section 4.3, *Listing by Location within Unihan.zip*. UAX #38 also has updated regex values for numerous Unihan properties. Emoji Changes  * 37 new emoji characters have been added. However, in addition   to those individual characters, many new emoji sequences have been   recognized, as well. Implementations supporting emoji should be   checked to reflect changes in   [UTS #51, Unicode Emoji](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-21.html)   and all of its associated data files.  Code Charts  * There was a significant update in the fonts used for many CJK auxiliary blocks,   to improve the design and consistency of glyphs. Details of the affected ranges   of glyphs can be found in the Glyph and Variation Sequence Changes table   on the   [single block delta charts page](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-14.0/). * There have also been systematic updates to many glyphs in the   [Egyptian Hieroglyphs](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-14.0/U140-13000.pdf)   block, to more accurately reflect current practice.   The old, frozen UCS2003 source column has been removed from the multi-column display for CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B for Version 14.0.0. For permanent reference, a [single source display of UCS2003](https://www.unicode.org/Public/13.0.0/charts/UCS2003.pdf) (8.7 MB) for the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B has been provided as part of the Version 13.0.0 archival charts. The rationale for this change is that the UCS2003 source was the source corresponding to the single column chart first printed in Unicode 4.0 in 2003. The glyphs for that single source had not tracked the extensive updates for characters in Extension B over the intervening years, and so in some cases were becoming misleading about the identity of some of the corrected characters in Extension B.   ---   | [Access to Copyright and terms of use](https://www.unicode.org/copyright.html) | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
