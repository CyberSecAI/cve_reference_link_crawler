		<h2>
			1 <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			A common task facing an implementer of the Unicode Standard is the
			provision of a parsing and/or lexing engine for identifiers, such as
			programming language variables or domain names.
				There are also realms where identifiers need to be defined with an extended set of
				characters to align better with what end users expect, such as in
				hashtags.
		</p>
		<p>
			To assist in the standard treatment of identifiers in Unicode
			character-based parsers and lexical analyzers, a set of
			specifications is provided here as a
				basis for parsing identifiers that contain Unicode characters. These specifications
				include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a
					href="#Default_Identifier_Syntax">Default Identifiers</a>: a
				recommended default for the definition of identifiers.</li>
			<li><a href="#Immutable_Identifier_Syntax">Immutable
					Identifiers</a>: for environments that need a definition of
				identifiers that does not change across versions of Unicode.</li>
			<li><a href="#hashtag_identifiers">Hashtag
					Identifiers</a>: for identifiers that need a broader set of
				characters, principally for hashtags.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These guidelines follow the typical pattern of identifier
			syntax rules in common programming languages, by defining an ID_Start
			class and an ID_Continue class and using a simple BNF rule for
			identifiers based on those classes; however, the composition of those
			classes is more complex and contains additional types of characters,
			due to the universal scope of the Unicode Standard.</p>
		<p>
			This annex also provides guidelines for the use of normalization and
			case insensitivity with identifiers, expanding on a section that was
			originally in Unicode Standard Annex #15, “Unicode Normalization
			Forms” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UAX15">UAX15</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			Lexical analysis of computer languages is also concerned with lexical
			elements other than identifiers, and with white space and line breaks
			that separate them. This annex provides guidelines for the sets of
			characters that have such lexical significance outside of identifiers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The specification in this annex provides a definition of identifiers
			that is guaranteed to be backward compatible with each successive
			release of Unicode, but also allows any appropriate new Unicode
			characters to become available in identifiers. In addition, Unicode
			character properties for stable pattern syntax are provided. The
			resulting pattern syntax is backward compatible <i>and</i> forward
			compatible over future versions of the Unicode Standard. These
			properties can either be used alone or in conjunction with the
			identifier characters.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Figure 1</i> shows the disjoint categories of code points defined
			in this annex. (The sizes of the boxes are not to scale.)

			The set consisting of the union of <i>ID_Start</i> and <i>ID_Nonstart</i>
			characters is known as <i>Identifier Characters</i> and has the
			property <i>ID_Continue</i>. The <i>ID_Nonstart</i> set is defined as
			the set difference <i>ID_Continue</i> minus <i>ID_Start</i>: it is
			not a formal Unicode property. While lexical rules are traditionally
			expressed in terms of the latter, the discussion here is simplified
			by referring to disjoint categories.

		<h3>
			1.1 <a name="Stability" href="#Stability">Stability</a>
		</h3>
		<p>There are certain features that developers can depend on for
			stability:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Identifier characters, Pattern_Syntax characters, and
				Pattern_White_Space are disjoint: they will never overlap.</li>
			<li>By definition, the Identifier characters are always a superset of the
				ID_Start characters.</li>
			<li>The Pattern_Syntax characters and Pattern_White_Space
				characters are immutable and will not change over successive
				versions of Unicode.</li>
			<li>The ID_Start and ID_Nonstart characters may grow over time,
				either by the addition of new characters provided in a future
				version of Unicode or (in rare cases) by the addition of characters
				that were in Other.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In successive versions of Unicode, the only allowed changes of
			characters from one of the above classes to another are those listed
			with a plus sign (+) in <i>Table 1.</i>

			The Unicode Consortium has formally adopted a stability policy on

		</p>
		<h3>
			1.2 <a name="Customization" href="#Customization">Customization</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Each programming language standard has its own identifier
			syntax; different programming languages have different conventions
			for the use of certain characters such as $, @, #, and _ in
			identifiers. To extend such a syntax to cover the full behavior of a
			Unicode implementation, implementers may combine those specific rules
			with the syntax and properties provided here.</p>
		<p>
			Each programming language can define its identifier syntax as <i>relative</i>
			to the Unicode identifier syntax, such as saying that identifiers are
			defined by the Unicode properties, with the addition of “$”. By
			addition or subtraction of a small set of language specific
			characters, a programming language standard can easily track a
			growing repertoire of Unicode characters in a compatible way. See
			also <i>Section 2.5, <a href="#Backward_Compatibility">Backward
					Compatibility</a></i>.
		</p>
		<p>Similarly, each programming language can define its own
			whitespace characters or syntax characters relative to the Unicode
			Pattern_White_Space or Pattern_Syntax characters, with some specified
			set of additions or subtractions.</p>
		<p>
			Systems that want to extend identifiers to encompass words used in
			natural languages, or narrow identifiers for security may do so as
			described in <i>Section 2.3, <a
				href="#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters">Layout and Format
					Control Characters</a></i>, <i>Section 2.4, <a
				href="#Specific_Character_Adjustments">Specific Character
					Adjustments</a></i>, and <i>Section 5, <a
				href="#normalization_and_case">Normalization and Case</a></i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To preserve the disjoint nature of the categories illustrated in <i>Figure
				1</i>, any character <i>added</i> to one of the categories must be <i>subtracted</i>
			from the others.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> In many cases there are important
				security implications that may require additional constraints on
				identifiers. For more information, see [<a
					href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTR36">UTR36</a>].
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>
			1.3 <a name="Display_Format" href="#Display_Format">Display
				Format</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Implementations may use a format for <em>displaying</em> identifiers
			that differs from the internal form used to <em>compare</em>
			identifiers. For example, an implementation might display what
			the user has entered, but use a normalized format for comparison.
			Examples of this include:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<strong>Case. </strong>The display format retains case differences,
				but the comparison format erases them by using Case_Folding. Thus
				“A” and its lowercase variant “a” would be treated as the same
				identifier internally, even though they may have been input
				differently and may display differently.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Variants. </strong>The display format retains variant
				distinctions, such as halfwidth versus fullwidth forms, or between
				variation sequences and their base characters, but the comparison
				format erases them by using NFKC_Case_Folding. Thus “A” and its
				full-width variant “Ａ” would be treated as the same identifier
				internally, even though they may have been input differently and may
				display differently.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			For an example of the use of display versus comparison formats see <em>UTS
				#46: Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing</em> [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS46">UTS46</a>]. For more information
			about normalization and case in identifiers see <em>Section 5, <a

		<h3>1.5 <a name="Notation" href="#Notation">Notation</a></h3>
		<p>This annex uses <em>UnicodeSet</em> notation to illustrate the derivation of
		some properties or sets of characters.
		This notation is defined in the
		<a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Sets">“Unicode Sets” section</a> of
		<i>UTS #35, Unicode Locale Data Markup Language</i>
		[<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS35">UTS35</a>].</p>

		<h2>
			2 <a name="Default_Identifier_Syntax"
				href="#Default_Identifier_Syntax">Default Identifiers</a>
		</h2>

		<p>The formal syntax provided here captures the general intent
			that an identifier consists of a string of characters beginning with
			a letter or an ideograph, and followed by any number of letters,
			ideographs, digits, or underscores. It provides a definition of
			identifiers that is guaranteed to be backward compatible with each
			successive release of Unicode, but also adds any appropriate new
			Unicode characters.</p>
		<p>The formulations allow for extensions, also
			known as <em>profiles</em>. That is, the particular set of code points or sequences of code points for
			each category used by the syntax can be customized according to the
			requirements of the environment. Profiles are described
			as additions to or removals from the categories used by the syntax.
			They can thus be combined, provided that there are no conflicts (whereby one profile adds a character
			and another removes it), or that the resolution of such conflicts is specified.</p>
		<p>If such extensions include characters from Pattern_White_Space or
			Pattern_Syntax, then such identifiers do not conform to an unmodified
			<i><a href="#R3">UAX31-R3 Pattern_White_Space and Pattern_Syntax
				Characters</a></i>. However, such extensions may often be necessary. For
			example, Java and C++ identifiers include ‘$’, which is a
			Pattern_Syntax character.</p>

			Identifiers are defined by assigning the

		<p>One such profile may
		  be to use the contents of ID_Start and ID_Continue in place of

	  <p>Another such profile would be to include  some set of
		    the optional characters, for example:
      <ul>
		      <li>Start := XID_Start, plus some characters
		        from <a href="#Table_Optional_Start">Table 3</a></li>
		      <li>Continue := Start + XID_Continue, plus some

      		<p>
      		<b>Note:</b> Characters in the Medial class must not overlap with those in

			must be be checked to ensure they do not also occur in either the newly defined Start class
			or Continue class.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			Beyond such minor modifications, profiles could also be used to significantly extend the
			character set available in identifiers.
			In so doing, care must be taken not to unintentionally include undesired characters,
			or to violate important invariants.
		</p>
		<p>
			An implementation should be careful when adding a property-based set to a profile.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, consider a profile that adds subscript and superscript digits and
			operators in order to support technical notations, such as:</p>
		<div align="center">
			<table class="subtle">
				<tr>
					<th>Context</th>
					<th>Example Identifier</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Assyriology</td>
					<td><code>dun₃⁺</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Chemistry</td>
					<td><code>Ca²⁺_concentration</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mathematics</td>
					<td><code>xₖ₊₁</code> <i>or</i> <code>f⁽⁴⁾</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Phonetics</td>
					<td><code>daan⁶</code></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			That profile may be described as adding the following set to XID_Continue:
		</p>
			<blockquote>
				<code>[⁽₍⁾₎⁺₊⁼₌⁻₋⁰₀¹₁²₂³₃⁴₄⁵₅⁶₆⁷₇⁸₈⁹₉]</code>.
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<b>Note:</b> The above list is for illustration only.
				A standard profile is provided to support the use of Mathematical Compatibility Notation Profile in identifiers.
				See <i>Section 7.1, <a href="#Mathematical_Compatibility_Notation_Profile">Mathematical Compatibility Notation Profile</a></i>.
			</blockquote>
		<p>
			If, instead of listing these characters explicitly, the profile had chosen to use
			properties or combinations of properties, that might result in including
			undesired characters.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, <code>\p{General_Category=Other_Number}</code> is the general category set
			containing the subscript and superscript digits.
			But it also includes the compatibility characters [<code>⑴ 🄂 ⒈</code>], which are
			not needed for technical notations,
			and are very likely inappropriate for identifiers—on multiple counts.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, a language that allows currency symbols in identifiers could have
			<code>\p{General_Category=Currency_Symbol}</code> as a profile,
			since that property matches the intent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, a profile based on adding entire blocks is likely to include unintended characters,
			or to miss ones that are desired.
			For the use of blocks see <i>Annex A, Character Blocks</i>,
			in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			Defining a profile by use of a property also needs to take account of the fact that
			unless the property is designed to be stable (such as XID_Continue),
			code points could be removed in a future version of Unicode.
			If the profile also needs stable identifiers (backwards compatible),
			then it must take additional measures.
			See <i><a href="#R1b">UAX31-R1b Stable Identifiers</a></i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Implementations that require identifier closure
			under normalization should ensure that any custom profile preserves identifier closure
			under the chosen normalization form. See
			<i>Section 5.1.3, <a href="#Identifier_Closure">Identifier Closure Under Normalization</a></i>. The example cited above regarding subscripts and superscripts preserves identifier closure under
			Normalization Forms C and D, but <em>not</em> under Forms KC and KD.
			Under NFKC and NFKD, the subscript and superscript parentheses and operators normalize
			to their ASCII counterparts.
			If an implementation that uses this profile relies on identifier closure under normalization, it
			should conform to <a href="#R4">UAX31-R4</a> using NFC, not NFKC.

		<h3>
			2.1 <a name="Combining_Marks" href="#Combining_Marks">Combining
				Marks</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Combining marks are accounted for in identifier syntax: a composed
			character sequence consisting of a base character followed by any
			number of combining marks is valid in an identifier. Combining marks
			are required in the representation of many languages, and the
			conformance rules in <i>Chapter 3, Conformance</i>, of [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] require the
			interpretation of canonical-equivalent character sequences. The
			simplest way to do this is to require identifiers in the NFC format
			(or transform them into that format); see <i>Section 5, <a
				href="#normalization_and_case">Normalization and Case</a></i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Enclosing combining marks (such as U+20DD..U+20E0) are excluded from
			the definition of the
			lexical class
			<code>ID_Continue</code>,
			because the composite characters that result from their composition
			with letters are themselves not normally considered valid
			constituents of these identifiers.
		</p>
		<h3>
			2.2 <a name="Modifier_Letters" href="#Modifier_Letters">Modifier
				Letters</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Modifier letters (General_Category=Lm) are also included in the
			definition of the syntax classes for identifiers. Modifier letters
			are often part of natural language orthographies and are useful for
			making word-like identifiers in formal languages. On the other hand,
			modifier symbols (General_Category=Sk), which are seldom a part of
			language orthographies, are excluded from identifiers. For more
			discussion of modifier letters and how they function, see [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
		</p>
		<p>Implementations that tailor identifier syntax for special
			purposes may wish to take special note of modifier letters, as in

			which may be confused with common syntax characters such as quotation
			marks.</p>
		<h3>
			2.3 <a name="Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters"
				href="#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters">Layout and Format
				Control Characters</a>
		</h3>

		<p>
			Certain Unicode characters are known as
			Default_Ignorable_Code_Points. These include variation selectors and
			characters used to control joining behavior, bidirectional ordering
			control, and alternative formats for display (having the
			General_Category value of Cf). The use of
			default-ignorable characters in identifiers is problematic, first
			because the effects they represent are stylistic or otherwise out of
			scope for identifiers, and second because the characters themselves
			often have no visible display. It is also possible to misapply these
			characters such that users can create strings that look the same but
			actually contain different characters, which can create security
			problems. In environments where spoofing concerns are paramount, such as top-level domain names, identifiers should also be limited to
			characters that are case-folded and normalized with the NFKC_Casefold
			operation. For more information, see <i>Section 5, <a
				href="#normalization_and_case">Normalization and Case</a></i> and <i>UTR
				#36: Unicode Security Considerations</i> [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTR36">UTR36</a>].
		</p>
	  <p> While not all Default_Ignorable_Code_Points are in XID_Continue, the variation selectors and joining controls <em>are</em> included in XID_Continue.
		  These variation selectors are used in standardized variation sequences, sequences from the Ideographic Variation Database, and emoji variation sequences.
			The joining controls are used in the orthographies of some languages, as well as in emoji ZWJ sequences.
		  However, these characters are subject to the same considerations as other Default_Ignorable_Code_Points listed above.
		  Because variation selectors and joining controls request a difference in display but do not guarantee it, they do not work well in general-purpose identifiers.
		  A profile should be used to remove them from general-purpose identifiers (along with other Default_Ignorable_Code_Points), unless their use is required in a particular domain, such as in a profile that includes emoji.
	      For such a profile it may be useful to explicitly retain or even add certain  Default_Ignorable_Code_Points in the identifier syntax.</p>
		<p>For programming language identifiers, spoofing issues are more comprehensively addressed by higher-level diagnostics rather than at the syntactic level. See Unicode Technical Standard #55, “Unicode Source Code Handling” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS55">UTS55</a>].</p>
	  <p><b><em>Comparison.</em></b> In any environment where the display form for identifiers differs from the form used to compare them, Default_Ignorable_Code_Points should be ignored for comparison.
		  For example, this applies to case-insensitive identifiers.
		  For more information, see <em>Section 1.3, <a href="#Display_Format">Display Format</a></em>.</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
			  <ul><li>An implementation of <a href="#R4">UAX31-R4</a> and <a href="#R5">UAX31-R5</a> (Equivalent Case and Compatibility-Insensitive Identifiers) that compares identifiers under the <i>identifier caseless match</i> defined by D147 [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>], that is, canonical decomposition (NFD) followed by the toNFKC_Casefold operation, ignores Default_Ignorable_Code_Points.</li>
			    <li>The  Default_Ignorable_Code_Point property values are not guaranteed to be stable.
					However, the derivation of the NFKC_Casefold property will be changed if necessary to ensure that it remains stable for default identifiers.
					That means that the toNFKC_Casefold operation applied to a string with only characters in XID_Continue in a version of Unicode will have the same results in any future version of Unicode.</li>
			  </ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				In addition, a standard profile is provided to exclude all Default_Ignorable_Code_Points; see <i>Section 7, <a href="#Standard_Profiles">Standard Profiles</a></i>. Note however that, even if Default_Ignorable_Code_Points are excluded, spoofing issues remain unless the mechanisms in Unicode Technical Standard #39, “Unicode Security Mechanisms” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS39">UTS39</a>] are utilized.

		<p>The General Security Profile defined in Section 3.1, General Security Profile for Identifiers, in <em>UTS #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms</em> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS39">UTS39</a>], excludes all Default_Ignorable_Code_Points by default, including variation selectors.</p>

				href="#Specific_Character_Adjustments">Specific Character
				Adjustments</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Specific identifier syntaxes can be treated as tailorings (or <i>profiles</i>)
			of the generic syntax based on character properties. For example, SQL
			identifiers allow an underscore as an identifier continue, but not as
			an identifier start; C identifiers allow an underscore as either an
			identifier continue or an identifier start. Specific languages may
			also want to exclude the characters that have a Decomposition_Type
			other than Canonical or None, or to exclude some subset of those,
			such as those with a Decomposition_Type equal to Font.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are circumstances in which identifiers are expected to more
			fully encompass words or phrases used in natural languages.
		</p>
		<p>
			For more natural-language identifiers, a profile should allow the
			characters in <i><a href="#Table_Optional_Start">Table 3</a></i>, <i><a href="#Table_Optional_Medial">Table
						3a</a></i>, and<i> <a href="#Table_Optional_Continue">Table 3b</a></i> in

				to medial positions. These are listed in <i><a
					href="#Table_Optional_Medial">Table 3a</a></i>. A few characters can
				also occur in final positions, and are listed in <i><a
					href="#Table_Optional_Continue">Table 3b</a></i>. The contents of these
				tables may overlap.

			This is the recommendation as of the current version of Unicode; as

			be added to Tables <i><a
				href="#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers">4</a></i>,
			<i><a href="#Table_Recommended_Scripts">5</a></i>, and <i><a
				href="#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts">7</a></i>. Characters may also be
			moved from one table to another as more information becomes
			available.
		</p>
		<p>There are a few special cases:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Common and Inherited script values
				[\p{script=Zyyy}\p{script=Zinh}] are used widely with other scripts,
				rather than being scripts per se. See also the Script_Extensions
				property in the Unicode Character Database [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UAX44">UAX44</a>].
			</li>
			<li>The Unknown script \p{script=Zzzz} is used for Unassigned
				characters.</li>
			<li>Braille \p{script=Brai} consists only of symbols</li>
			<li>Katakana_Or_Hiragana \p{script=Hrkt} is empty. This value was used
				in earlier versions, but is no longer used.</li>
			<li>With respect to the scripts Balinese, Cham, Ol Chiki, Vai,
				Kayah Li, and Saurashtra, there may be large communities of people
				speaking an associated language, but the script itself is not  in
				widespread use. However, there are significant revival efforts.</li>
			<li>Bopomofo is used primarily in education.</li>

		<p>
			Unicode General_Category values are kept as stable as possible, but
			they can change across versions of the Unicode Standard. The bulk of
			the characters having a given value are determined by other
			properties, and the coverage expands in the future according to the
			assignment of those properties. In addition, the Other_ID_Start
			property provides a small list of characters that qualified as
			ID_Start characters in some previous version of Unicode solely on the
			basis of their General_Category properties, but that no longer
			qualify in the current version.
		</p>
		<p>The Other_ID_Start property includes characters such as the
			following:</p>
		<blockquote>
			U+2118 ( ℘ ) SCRIPT CAPITAL P<br> U+212E ( ℮ ) ESTIMATED SYMBOL<br>
			U+309B ( ゛ ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA VOICED SOUND MARK<br> U+309C ( ゜
			) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK
		</blockquote>
		<p>Similarly, the Other_ID_Continue property adds a small list of
			characters that qualified as ID_Continue characters in some previous
			version of Unicode solely on the basis of their General_Category
			properties, but that no longer qualify in the current version.</p>
		<p>The Other_ID_Continue property includes characters such as the
			following:</p>
		<!-- Do NOT put the actual Ethiopic characters back in the examples. For
         whatever reason, they trigger an IE8 quirk that puts the browser in
         compatibility mode for this document! -->
		<blockquote>
			U+1369 ETHIOPIC DIGIT ONE...U+1371 ETHIOPIC DIGIT NINE<br>
			U+00B7 ( · ) MIDDLE DOT<br> U+0387 ( &#x0387; ) GREEK ANO TELEIA<br>
			U+19DA ( ᧚ ) NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The exact list of characters covered by the Other_ID_Start and
			Other_ID_Continue properties depends on the version of Unicode. For
			more information, see Unicode Standard Annex #44, “Unicode Character
			Database” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UAX44">UAX44</a>].
		</p>
		<p>The Other_ID_Start and Other_ID_Continue properties are thus
			designed to ensure that the Unicode identifier specification is
			backward compatible. Any sequence of characters that qualified as an
			identifier in some version of Unicode will continue to qualify as an
			identifier in future versions.</p>
		<p>If a specification tailors the Unicode recommendations for
			identifiers, then this technique can also be used to maintain
			backwards compatibility across versions.</p>


		<h2>
			3 <a name="Immutable_Identifier_Syntax"
				href="#Immutable_Identifier_Syntax">Immutable Identifiers</a><a
				name="Alternative_Identifier_Syntax"></a>
		</h2>
		<p>The disadvantage of working with the lexical classes defined
			previously is the storage space needed for the detailed definitions,
			plus the fact that with each new version of the Unicode Standard new
			characters are added, which an existing parser would not be able to
			recognize. In other words, the recommendations based on that table
			are not upwardly compatible.</p>
		<p>This problem can be addressed by turning the question around.
			Instead of defining the set of code points that are allowed, define a
			small, fixed set of code points that are reserved for syntactic use
			and allow everything else (including unassigned code points) as part
			of an identifier. All parsers written to this specification would
			behave the same way for all versions of the Unicode Standard, because
			the classification of code points is fixed forever.</p>
		<p>
			The drawback of this method is that it allows “nonsense” to be part
			of identifiers because the concerns of lexical classification and of
			human intelligibility are separated. Human intelligibility can,
			however, be addressed by other means, such as usage guidelines that
			encourage a restriction to meaningful terms for identifiers. For an
			example of such guidelines, see the XML specification by the W3C,
			Version 1.0 5th Edition or later [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#XML">XML</a>].
		</p>
		<p>By increasing the set of disallowed characters, a reasonably
			intuitive recommendation for identifiers can be achieved. This
			approach uses the full specification of identifier classes, as of a
			particular version of the Unicode Standard, and permanently disallows
			any characters not recommended in that version for inclusion in
			identifiers. All code points unassigned as of that version would be
			allowed in identifiers, so that any future additions to the standard
			would already be accounted for. This approach ensures both upwardly
			compatible identifier stability and a reasonable division of
			characters into those that do and do not make human sense as part of
			identifiers.</p>
		<p>With or without such fine-tuning, such a compromise approach
			still incurs the expense of implementing large lists of code points.
			While they no longer change over time, it is a matter of choice
			whether the benefit of enforcing somewhat word-like identifiers
			justifies their cost.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, one can use the properties described below and
			allow all sequences of characters to be identifiers that are neither
			Pattern_Syntax nor Pattern_White_Space. This has the advantage of
			simplicity and small tables, but allows many more “unnatural”
			identifiers.		</p>
		<p>
			<b><a name="R2" href="#R2">UAX31-R2</a></b>.
				<b>Immutable Identifiers:</b> <i>To meet this requirement,
				an implementation shall
				choose either <a href="#R2-1">UAX31-R2-1</a> or <a href="#R2-2">UAX31-R2-2</a>.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
				<b><a name="R2-1" href="#R2-1">UAX31-R2-1</a></b>.
				<i>Define identifiers to be any non-empty

		<ul>
			<li>Pattern_White_Space=True</li>
			<li>Pattern_Syntax=True</li>
			<li>General_Category=Private_Use, Surrogate, or Control</li>
			<li>Noncharacter_Code_Point=True</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<b><a name="R2-2" href="#R2-2">UAX31-R2-2</a></b>.
				<i>Declare that it uses a <b>profile</b>
				of <a href="#R2-1">UAX31-R2-1</a>
				and define that profile with a precise specification of the
				characters and character sequences that are added to or removed from the sets of code points
				defined by these properties and/or provide a list of additional constraints on identifiers.
			</i>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<b>Note:</b> The expectation from an implementation meeting requirement UAX31-R2 Immutable Identifiers is that it will never change its definition of identifiers; in particular, that it will not switch to UAX31-R1 Default Identifiers. However, the downsides of normalization issues and the inapplicability of measures guarding against spoofing attacks may warrant such a change in definition. In such circumstances, a profile should be used to extend XID_Start and XID_Continue to cover likely existing usages. See <i>Section 3.3, Language Evolution</i>, in Unicode Technical Standard #55, “Unicode Source Code Handling” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS55">UTS55</a>].
		</blockquote>

		<p>In its profile, a specification can define identifiers to be
			more in accordance with the Unicode identifier definitions at the
			time the profile is adopted, while still allowing for strict
			immutability. For example, an implementation adopting a profile after
			a particular version of Unicode is released (such as Unicode 5.0)
			could define the profile as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>All characters satisfying <i><a href="#R1">UAX31-R1
						Default Identifiers</a></i> according to Unicode 5.0
			</li>
			<li>Plus all code points unassigned in Unicode 5.0 that do not
				have the property values specified in
				<i><a href="#R2">UAX31-R2 Immutable Identifiers</a></i>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This technique allows identifiers to have a more natural
			format—excluding symbols and punctuation already defined—yet also
			provides absolute code point immutability.</p>
		<p>Immutable identifiers are intended for those cases (like XML) that
			cannot update across versions of Unicode, and do not require
			information about normalization form, or properties such as
			General_Category and Script. Immutable identifers that allow
			unassigned characters cannot provide for normalization forms
			or these properties, which means that they:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>cannot be compared for NFC, NFKC, or case-insensitive equality</li>
          <li>are unsuitable for restrictions such as those in UTS #39</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For best practice, a profile disallowing unassigned characters should be provided where  possible.</p>

		</h2>

		<p>Most programming languages have a concept of
			whitespace as part of their lexical structure, as well as some set of
			characters that are disallowed in identifiers but have syntactic
			use, such as arithmetic operators.
			Beyond general programming languages,
			there are also many circumstances where software interprets
			patterns that are a mixture of literal characters, whitespace, and syntax
			characters. Examples include regular expressions, Java collation
			rules, Excel or ICU number formats, and many others. In the past,
			regular expressions and other formal languages have been forced to
			use clumsy combinations of ASCII characters for their syntax. As
			Unicode becomes ubiquitous, some of these will start to use non-ASCII
			characters for their syntax: first as more readable optional
			alternatives, then eventually as the standard syntax.</p>
		<p>
			For forward and backward compatibility, it is advantageous to have a
			fixed set of whitespace and syntax code points.
			This follows the recommendations that the Unicode Consortium has made
			regarding completely stable identifiers, and the practice that is
			seen in XML 1.0, 5th Edition or later [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#XML">XML</a>]. (In particular, the
			Unicode Consortium is committed to not allocating characters suitable
			for identifiers in the range U+2190..U+2BFF, which is being used by
			XML 1.0, 5th Edition.)
		</p>

		<p>As of Unicode 4.1, two Unicode character properties are defined
			to provide for stable syntax: Pattern_White_Space and
			Pattern_Syntax.&nbsp; Particular languages may, of course,
			override these recommendations, for example, by adding or removing
			other characters for compatibility with ASCII usage.</p>
		<p>For stability, the values of these properties are absolutely
			invariant, not changing with successive versions of Unicode. Of
			course, this does not limit the ability of the Unicode Standard to
			encode more symbol or whitespace characters, but the default sets of syntax and
			whitespace code points recommended for use in computer languages will not
			change.</p>

		<h3>4.1 <a name="Whitespace" href="#Whitespace">Whitespace</a></h3>

		<p>
		Many computer languages treat two categories of whitespace differently: horizontal space (such as the ASCII horizontal tabulation and space), and line terminators.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a syntax supports non-ASCII characters, it is useful to consider a third category: <em>ignorable format controls</em>. Ignorable format controls may be inserted between lexical elements in order to resolve bidirectional ordering issues, as described in <i>Section 4.1.1, <a href="#Bidirectional_Ordering">Bidirectional Ordering</a></i>. The insertion of these characters does not change the meaning of the program; in particular, they are not spacing characters. See <i>Section 4.1.2, <a href="#Required_Spaces">Required Spaces</a></i>.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<b>Note:</b> Allowing for the insertion of ignorable format controls does not prevent spoofing based on bidirectional reordering.
			In order to guard against such spoofing, implementations should make use of the higher-level protocols and conversion to plain text described in Unicode Standard Annex #9, “Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>]. See Unicode Technical Standard #55, “Unicode Source Code Handling” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS55">UTS55</a>].
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<b>Note:</b> Since these characters are allowed only where a boundary would, in their absence, exist between lexical elements, an implementation could ignore them when lexing, and then consider as illegal any lexical element that contains them. An exception must be made for comments and strings, which should be able to freely contain these characters.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Implementations should also allow these characters in other contexts where reordering issues could arise. See Unicode Technical Standard #55, “Unicode Source Code Handling” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS55">UTS55</a>].

		<h4>4.1.1 <a href="#Bidirectional_Ordering" name="Bidirectional_Ordering">Bidirectional Ordering</a></h4>
			<p>
				Requirement <a href="#R3a">UAX31-R3a</a> is relevant even for languages that do not
				use immutable identifiers, or that have lexical structure outside of the
				categories of syntax and whitespace characters. In particular, the set of
				Pattern_White_Space characters is chosen to make it possible to correct
				bidirectional ordering issues that can arise in a wide range of programming
				languages, visually obfuscating the logic of expressions.
				In the absence of higher-level protocols (see Section 4.3,
				<i>Higher-Level Protocols</i>, in
				[<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>]), tokens may be visually
				reordered by the Unicode Bidi Algorithm in bidirectional source text,
				producing a visual result that conveys a different logical intent.
				To remedy that, two implicit directional marks are among Pattern_White_Space
				characters; if these can be freely inserted between tokens, implicit
				directional marks <i>consistent with the paragraph direction</i> can be used to
				ensure that the visual order of tokens matches their logical order.
			</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>Example:</b> Consider the following two lines:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				(1) <code>x + tav == 1</code>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				(2) <code>x + תו == 1</code>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				Internally, they are the same except that the ASCII identifier <code>tav</code> in line (1) is replaced by the Hebrew
				identifier <code>תו</code> in line (2). However, with a plain text display (with left-to-right paragraph direction) the user
				will be misled, thinking that line (2) is a comparison between <code>(x + 1)</code> and <code>תו</code>, whereas it is actually a
				comparison between <code>(x + תו)</code> and <code>1</code>.
				The misleading rendering of (2) occurs because the directionality of the identifier תו
				influences subsequent weakly-directional tokens; inserting a left-to-right
				mark after the identifier <code>תו</code> stops it from influencing the remainder of the
				line, and thus yields a better rendering in plain text with left-to-right
				paragraph direction, as demonstrated in the following table, wherein characters
				whose ordering is affected by that identifier have been highlighted.

			visual appearance would otherwise be too confusing to readers: “<code>else</code>⟨LRM⟩<code>if</code>”
			would be seen by the user as “<code>elseif</code>” but parsed by the compiler as “<code>else if</code>”,
			whereas “<code>else</code>⟨LRM⟩<code> if</code>” would be seen and parsed as “<code>else  if</code>” and be harmless.
		</p>

		<h4>4.1.3 <a href="#Contexts_for_Ignorable_Format_Controls" name="Contexts_for_Ignorable_Format_Controls">Contexts for Ignorable Format Controls</a></h4>

		<h3>4.2 <a name="Syntax" href="#Syntax">Syntax</a></h3>

		<p>The lexical structure of formal languages involves characters that are not allowed in identifiers and are not whitespace, but that have some special lexical significance other than being literal characters (such as in string literals) or ignored (such as in comments). These are referred to in this document as <em>characters with syntactic use</em>.</p>
		<p>Examples of characters with syntactic use include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>decimal marks in numeric literals</li>
			<li>arithmetic operators, such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code></li>
			<li>parentheses and other brackets</li>
			<li>characters in comment delimiters, such as <code>#</code>, <code>/*</code>, <code>--</code>, or <code>⍝</code></li>
			<li>quotation marks delimiting strings</li>
			<li>characters such as <code>\</code> introducing escape sequences</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		It is useful to bound the set of characters with syntactic use.
		This makes it possible to build tools that handle source code, but do not validate it, such as
		syntax highlighters, in a forward-compatible way; see Unicode Technical Standard #55, “Unicode Source Code Handling” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS55">UTS55</a>].
		It further provides a stable set of characters that can be used for user-defined operators.
		In addition, this allows for backward compatibility of literals (including patterns), as described in <i>Section 4.3, <a href="#Pattern_Syntax">Pattern Syntax</a></i>.

			For instance, in a language which uses the C syntax for hexadecimal literals and meets requirement <a href="#R1">UAX31-R1</a>, the literal <code>0xDEADBEEF</code> consists entirely of identifier characters, yet the <code>0x</code> has special significance in the syntax, and the characters after that prefix are subject to special restrictions (only 0 through 9 and A through F are allowed).
			</p>
			<p>
			However, characters outside of those allowed in identifiers, those treated as whitespace, and the set [:Pattern_Syntax:] cannot be given special significance in the syntax. For instance, if a language meets requirements <a href="#R1">UAX31-R1</a> and <a href="#R3">UAX31-R3</a> with no profile and allows for user-defined operators, that language cannot allow the user to define an operator 🐈.

			Some programming languages allow for user-defined operators.

		When meeting this requirement, a profile is likely to be needed depending on the specifics of the syntax. For instance, a programming language wherein string literals start with " should remove that character from the characters allowed in operators.

		<h3>4.3 <a name="Pattern_Syntax" href="#Pattern_Syntax">Pattern Syntax</a></h3>

		<p>With a fixed set of whitespace and syntax code points, a
			pattern language can have a policy requiring all possible syntax
			characters (even ones currently unused) to be quoted if they are
			literals. Using this policy preserves the freedom to extend the
			syntax in the future by using those characters. Past patterns on
			future systems will always work; future patterns on past systems will
			signal an error instead of silently producing the wrong results.
			Consider the following scenario, for example.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				In version 1.0 of program X, &#39;≈&#39; is a reserved syntax
				character; that is, it does not perform an operation, and it needs
				to be quoted. In this example, &#39;\&#39; <i>quotes</i> the next
				character; that is, it causes it to be treated as a literal instead
				of a syntax character. In version 2.0 of program X, &#39;≈&#39; is
				given a real meaning—for example, “uppercase the subsequent
				characters”.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The pattern abc...\≈...xyz works on both versions 1.0 and
					2.0, and refers to the literal character because it is quoted in
					both cases.</li>
				<li>The pattern abc...≈...xyz works on version 2.0 and
					uppercases the following characters. On version 1.0, the engine
					(rightfully) has no idea what to do with ≈. Rather than silently
					fail (by ignoring ≈ or turning it into a literal), it has the
					opportunity to signal an error.</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			When <i>generating</i> rules or patterns, all whitespace and syntax
			code points that are to be literals require quoting, using whatever
			quoting mechanism is available. For readability, it is recommended
			practice to quote or escape all literal whitespace and default-ignorable code points as well.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Consider the following example, where the items in angle
				brackets indicate literal characters:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>a&lt;SPACE&gt;b &#x2192; x&lt;ZERO WIDTH SPACE&gt;y&nbsp; +
					z;</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Because &lt;SPACE&gt; is a Pattern_White_Space character, it
				requires quoting. Because &lt;ZERO WIDTH SPACE&gt; is a default-ignorable character, it should also be quoted for readability. So in
				this example, if \uXXXX is used for a code point literal, but is
				resolved before quoting, and if single quotes are used for quoting,
				this example might be expressed as:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>&#39;a\u0020b&#39; &#x2192; &#39;x\u200By&#39; + z;</p>

		<p>This section discusses issues that must be taken into account

			programming languages or scripting languages. Using normalization
			avoids many problems where apparently identical identifiers are not
			treated equivalently. Such problems can appear both during
			compilation and during linking—in particular across different
			programming languages. To avoid such problems, programming languages
			can normalize identifiers before storing or comparing them. Generally
			if the programming language has case-sensitive identifiers, then
			Normalization Form C is appropriate; whereas, if the programming
			language has case-insensitive identifiers, then Normalization Form KC
			is more appropriate.</p>

				Modifications</a>
		</h3>

		<p>Where programming languages are using NFKC to fold differences
			between characters, they need the following modifications of the
			identifier syntax from the Unicode Standard to deal with the
			idiosyncrasies of a small number of characters. These modifications
			are reflected in the XID_Start and XID_Continue properties.</p>

		<h4>
			5.1.1 <a name="Combining_Mark_Mods" href="#Combining_Mark_Mods">
				Modifications for Characters that Behave Like Combining Marks</a>
		</h4>

		<p>Certain characters are not formally combining characters,
			although they behave in most respects as if they were. In most cases,
			the mismatch does not cause a problem, but when these characters have
			compatibility decompositions, they can cause identifiers not to be
			closed under Normalization Form KC. In particular, the following four
			characters are included in XID_Continue and not XID_Start:</p>

		<ul style="list-style-type: none">
			<li>U+0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM</li>
			<li>U+0EB3 LAO VOWEL SIGN AM</li>
			<li>U+FF9E HALFWIDTH KATAKANA VOICED SOUND MARK</li>
			<li>U+FF9F HALFWIDTH KATAKANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>
			5.1.2 <a name="Irreg_Decomp_Mods" href="#Irreg_Decomp_Mods">
				Modifications for Irregularly Decomposing Characters</a>
		</h4>

		<p>U+037A GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI and certain Arabic presentation
			forms have irregular compatibility decompositions and are excluded
			from both XID_Start and XID_Continue. It is recommended that all
			Arabic presentation forms be excluded from identifiers in any event,
			although only a few of them must be excluded for normalization to
			guarantee identifier closure.</p>

		<h4>
			5.1.3 <a name="Identifier_Closure" href="#Identifier_Closure">
				Identifier Closure Under Normalization</a>
		</h4>

		<p>
			With these amendments to the identifier syntax, all identifiers are
			closed under all four Normalization Forms. This means that for any
			string S, the implications shown in <i>Figure 5</i> hold.
		</p>

			Those programming languages with case-insensitive identifiers should
			use the case foldings described in <i>Section 3.13, Default Case
				Algorithms</i>, of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
			to produce a case-insensitive normalized form.
		</p>
		<p>When source text is parsed for identifiers, the folding of
			distinctions (using case mapping or NFKC) must be delayed until after
			parsing has located the identifiers. Thus such folding of
			distinctions should not be applied to string literals or to comments
			in program source text.</p>
		<p>
			The Unicode Standard supports case folding with normalization, with
			the function toNFKC_Casefold(X). See definition R5 in <em>Section
				3.13, Default Case Algorithms</em> in [<a
				href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for the
			specification of this function and further explanation of its use.
		</p>
		<h3>
			5.2 <a name="Case_and_Stability" href="#Case_and_Stability">Case
				and Stability</a>
		</h3>
		<p>The alphabetic case of the initial character of an identifier
			is used as a mechanism to distinguish syntactic classes in some
			languages like Prolog, Erlang, Haskell, Clean, and Go. For example,
			in Prolog and Erlang, variables must begin with capital letters (or
			underscores) and atoms must not. There are some complications in the
			use of this mechanism.</p>
		<p>For such a casing distinction in a programming language to work
			with unicameral writing systems (such as Kanji or Devanagari),
			another mechanism (such as underscores) needs to substitute for the
			casing distinction.</p>
		<p>
			Casing stability is also an issue for bicameral writing systems. The
			assignment of General_Category property values, such as gc=Lu, is not
			guaranteed to be stable, nor is the assignment of characters to the
			broader properties such as Uppercase. So these property values cannot
			be used by themselves, without incorporating a 
			mechanism that preserves backward compatibility,
			such as is done for Unicode identifiers in <em>Section
				2.5 <a href="#Backward_Compatibility">Backward Compatibility</a></em>.
				That is, the implementation would maintain its own list of special
			inclusions and exclusions that require updating for each new version
			of Unicode.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, a programming language specification can use the
			operation specified in <a
				href="https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html#Case_Folding">Case
				Folding Stability</a> as the basis for its casing distinction. That
			operation <em>is</em> guaranteed to be stable. That is, one can use a
			casing distinction such as the following:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>S is a <strong>variable</strong> if S begins with an
				underscore.
			</li>
			<li>Otherwise, produce S' = toCasefold(toNFKC(S))
				<ol type="a">
					<li>S is a <strong>variable</strong> if firstCodePoint(S) ≠
						firstCodePoint(S'),
					</li>
					<li>otherwise S is an <strong>atom</strong>.<br>
					</li>
				</ol></li>
		</ol>
		<p>This test can clearly be optimized ​for the normal cases, such
			as initial ASCII. It is also recommended that identifiers be in NFKC
			format, which makes the detection even simpler.</p>
		<h4>
			5.2.1 <a name="Edge_Cases_for_Folding" href="#Edge_Cases_for_Folding">Edge
				Cases for Folding</a>
		</h4>
		<p>In Unicode 8.0, the Cherokee script letters have been changed
			from gc=Lo to gc=Lu, and corresponding lowercase letters (gc=Ll) have
			been added. This is an unusual pattern; typically when case pairs are
			added, existing letters are changed from gc=Lo to gc=Ll, and new
			corresponding uppercase letters (gc=Lu) are added. In the case of
			Cherokee, it was felt that this solution provided the most
			compatibility for existing implementations in terms of font
			treatment.</p>
		<p>The downside of this approach is that the Cherokee characters,
			when case-folded, will convert as necessary to the pre-8.0
			characters, namely to the uppercase versions. This folding is unlike
			that of any other case-mapped characters in Unicode. Thus the
			case-folded version of a Cherokee string will contain uppercase
			letters instead of lowercase letters. Compatibility with fonts for
			the current user community was felt to be more important than the
			confusion introduced by this edge case of case folding, because
			Cherokee programmatic identifiers would be rare.</p>
		<p>The upshot is that when it comes to identifiers,
			implementations should never use the General_Category or Lowercase or
			Uppercase properties to test for casing conditions, nor use
			toUppercase(), toLowercase(), or toTitlecase() to fold or test
			identifiers. Instead, they should instead use Case_Folding or
			NFKC_CaseFold.</p>

		</p>
		<p>
		These profiles are associated with profiles for requirements <a href="#R3b">UAX31-R3b</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Further, a standard profile is provided to exclude default-ignorable code points from identifiers. Having no visible effect in most contexts, these characters can lead to spoofing issues; see <i>Section 2.3, <a href="#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters">Layout and Format Control Characters</a></i>.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<h3>7.1 <a href="#Mathematical_Compatibility_Notation_Profile" name="Mathematical_Compatibility_Notation_Profile">Mathematical Compatibility Notation Profile</a></h3>

		<h3>7.2 <a href="#Emoji_Profile" name="Emoji_Profile">Emoji Profile</a></h3>
		<p>
			The Emoji Profile for  default identifiers provides for the inclusion of emoji characters and sequences in identifiers. A large subset of emoji are already supported in some programming languages, but this profile provides a mechanism for treating them consistently as part of the lexical structure of a language.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Emoji Profile for default identifiers consists of:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The addition of the RGI emoji set defined by ED-27 in Unicode Technical Standard #51, “Unicode Emoji” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS51">UTS51</a>] for a given version of Unicode to the sets <i>Start</i> and <i>Continue</i> in definition <a href="#D1">UAX31-D1</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				The removal of the code point U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (the Text Presentation Selector) from the set <i>Continue</i>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<b>Note:</b> The Emoji Profile requires the use of character sequences, rather than individual code points, in the sets <i>Start</i> and <i>Continue</i> defined by <a href="#D1">UAX31-D1</a>.  When using this profile, U+002A asterisk (*), U+203C double exclamation mark (‼), or U+263A white smiling face (☺) are not legal identifiers, but the sequences (U+002A, U+FE0F, U+20E3) *️⃣, (U+203C, U+FE0F) ‼️, and (U+263A, U+FE0F) ☺️ are allowed in identifiers. This would require some changes to lexers: when they hit a character that starts an emoji sequence they will (logically) switch to a different mechanism for parsing.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The Emoji Profile includes characters that are in Pattern_Syntax; it is therefore associated with a profile for <a href="#R3b">UAX31-R3b</a>, which consists of replacing each emoji character of a certain subset of [:Pattern_Syntax:] by its <b><i>text presentation sequence</i></b> (ED-8a):
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Remove the characters in the set [[:Pattern_Syntax:]&amp;[:Emoji_Presentation:]] from the set of characters with syntactic use.
			</li>
			<li>
			For all C in [[:Pattern_Syntax:]&amp;[:Emoji_Presentation:]], add the sequence consisting of C followed by U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (the Text Presentation Selector) to the set of characters with syntactic use.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In addition, in order to avoid lexical ambiguities between identifiers and operators, the Emoji Profile includes a profile for <a href="#R3c">UAX31-R3c</a>, which consists of the removal of the character U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (the Emoji Presentation Selector) from the set <i>Continue</i>.
		</p>
		<blockquote><b>Example:</b> Consider a language that meets requirements <a href="#R3b">UAX31-R3b</a>  and <a href="#R3b">UAX31-R3c</a> with no profile. U+2615 HOT BEVERAGE (☕) is a character with syntactic use, and therefore it is an operator. When meeting these requirements with the Emoji Profile, U+2615 HOT BEVERAGE (☕) is not a character with syntactic use (which allows it to be an identifier character) and ☕ is not a valid operator. However, the sequence U+2615 U+FE0F (☕︎) is added to the set of characters with syntactic use, and therefore ☕︎ is a valid operator.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			This change means that if some of the Pattern_Syntax characters with the Emoji_Presentation property were in syntactic use (e.g., in operators)  prior to adopting the Emoji Profile, they become identifiers once the profile is adopted, but can be turned back into operators by adding U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15, allowing for a migration path.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, if a programming language only uses a subset of the Pattern_Syntax characters that does not include these characters, no action needs to be taken.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some other characters in Pattern_Syntax (such as ↔) are used in emoji (such as ↔️), but they are not emoji on their own, so that they do not need to be removed from the set of characters with syntactic use as long as lexical analysis properly takes sequences into account.
		</p>
		<p>
		The emoji sequences require 98 default-ignorable characters:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER (also known as ZWJ)</li>
			<li>U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (also known as Emoji Presentation Selector)</li>
			<li>U+E0020..U+E007F 96 TAG characters</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Thus, if this profile is combined with any profile that removes default-ignorable characters, such as the Default-Ignorable Exclusion Profile, those characters need to be retained in the context of emoji sequences.
		</p>
		<p>Consider the following examples, in a language that meets requirement <a href="#R1">UAX31-R1</a> with both the Emoji Profile and the Default Ignorable Exclusion Profile:</p>
		<div align="center">
		<table class="subtle">

		<p><strong>Version 15.1</strong></p>
			<p>Requirement <a href="#R1a">UAX31-R1a Restricted Format Characters</a> has been withdrawn.</p>
			<p>If implementations that claimed conformance to UAX31-R1a wish to retain the contextual checks for ZWJ and ZWNJ, they should refer to the General Security Profile in Unicode Technical Standard #39, “Unicode Security Mechanisms” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS39">UTS39</a>].</p>
			<p>In previous versions, requirement <a href="#R3">UAX31-R3 Pattern_White_Space and Pattern_Syntax Characters</a> did not require any particular interpretation of whitespace characters. It now specifies which characters are to be treated as line terminators, horizontal space, and ignorable format controls. The meaning of syntactic use has also been clarified.</p>
			<p>Implementations that claim conformance to UAX31-R3 should check that they interpret the characters in Pattern_White_Space as described in <a href="#R3a">UAX31-R3a Pattern_White_Space Characters</a>, and that their use of Pattern_Syntax characters is consistent with <a href="#R3b">UAX31-R3b Pattern_Syntax Characters</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Version 15.0</strong></p>
			<p>In previous versions, the note explaining how to implement requirement <a href="#R7">UAX31-R7 Filtered Case-Insensitive Identifiers</a> with full case folding referred to the wrong property, and the requirement itself incorrectly refered to Normalization Form rather than case folded form.</p>
			<p>Implementations that claim conformance to UAX31-R7 should check that they use the correct property.</p>
		<p><strong>Version 13.0</strong></p>
        <p>Version 13.0 changed the structure of Table 4. <a href="#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers">Excluded Scripts</a> significantly, dropping conditions that were not based on script. Implementations that were based on Table 4 should refer to <em>UTS #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms</em> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-34.html#UTS39">UTS39</a>] for additional restrictions.</p>
        <p><strong>Version 11.0</strong></p>
		<p>Version 11.0 refines the use of ZWJ in identifiers (adding some restrictions and relaxing others slightly), and broadens the definition of hashtag identifiers somewhat. For details, see the <a href="#Modifications">Modifications</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Version 9.0</strong>
	  </p>
		<p>In previous versions, the text favored the use
			of XID_Start and XID_Continue, as in the following paragraph. However, the formal definition used ID_Start and ID_Continue.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				The XID_Start and XID_Continue properties are improved lexical
				classes that incorporate the changes described in <i>Section
					5.1, <a href="#NFKC_Modifications">NFKC Modifications</a></i>.
					They are recommended for most purposes, especially for security,
				over the original ID_Start and ID_Continue properties.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In version 9.0, that is swapped and the X versions are
			stated explicitly in the formal definition. This affects just the
			following characters.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<code>
					037A ; GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI<br> 0E33 ; THAI CHARACTER SARA AM<br>
					0EB3 ; LAO VOWEL SIGN AM<br> 309B ; KATAKANA-HIRAGANA VOICED
					SOUND MARK<br> 309C ; KATAKANA-HIRAGANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK<br>

				</code>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p> Implementations that wish to maintain
			conformance to the older recommendation need only declare a profile
			that uses  ID_Start and ID_Continue instead of XID_Start and XID_Continue.</p>
		<p>Version 9.0 splits the older Table 3 from Version 8.0 into 3
			parts.</p>
		<div align="center">
		<table class="subtle">
			<tr>
				<th>Current Tables</th>
				<th>Unicode 8.0</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><em>Table 3, <a href="#Table_Optional_Start">Optional Characters for Start</a></em></td>
				<td style="text-align: center" rowspan="2"><em>Table 3, Candidate Characters for Inclusion in ID_Continue</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><em>Table 3a, <a href="#Table_Optional_Medial">Optional Characters for Medial</a></em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><em>Table 3b, <a href="#Table_Optional_Continue">Optional Characters for Continue</a></em></td>
				<td style="text-align: center"><em>only outlined in text</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Version 6.1</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Between Unicode Versions 5.2, 6.0 and 6.1, Table 5 was split in
			three. In Version 6.1, the resulting tables were renumbered for
			easier reference. The titles and links remain the same, for
			stability.</p>
		<p>The following shows the correspondences:</p>
		<div align="center">
			<table class="subtle">
				<tr>
					<th>Current Tables</th>
					<th>Unicode 6.0</th>
					<th>Unicode 5.2</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>Table 5, <a href="#Table_Recommended_Scripts">Recommended Scripts</a></em></td>
					<td style="text-align: center" rowspan="2">5a</td>
					<td style="text-align: center" rowspan="3">5</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

				<tr>
					<td><em>Table 7, <a href="#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts">Limited Use Scripts</a></em></td>
					<td style="text-align: center">5b</td>

		<p><b>Revision 41</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Reissued</b> for Unicode 16.0.</li>
			<li><i>Section 2.3, <a href="#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters">Layout and Format Control Characters</a></i>,
			and <i>Section 5, <a href="#normalization_and_case">Normalization and Case</a></i>: clarified that
			NFD must be applied before toNFKC_Casefold in order to correctly meet
			requirements UAX31-R4 and UAX-R5 with NFKC and full case folding, and added
			a reference to definition D147 of the Unicode Standard.</li>
			<li><i>Section 2.4, <a href="#Specific_Character_Adjustments">Specific Character Adjustments</a></i>,
			Removed the suggestion to add MIDDLE DOT to as part of a profile:
			it is already part of default identifiers with no profile since Unicode Version 5.1.</li>
			<li><i>Section 2.5, <a href="#Backward_Compatibility">Backward Compatibility</a></i>:
			corrected the inappropriately-normalized occurrence of U+0387 in the list of Other_ID_Continue characters.</li>
