			3 <a name="Identifier_Characters" href="#Identifier_Characters">Identifier
				Characters</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Identifiers ("IDs") are strings used in application contexts
			to refer to specific entities of certain significance in the given application. In a
			given application, an identifier will map to at most one specific entity.
			Many applications have security requirements related to identifiers.  
			A common example is URLs referring to pages
			or other resources on the Internet: when a user wishes to access  a
			resource, it is important that the user can be certain what resource they
			are interacting with. For example, they need to know that they are interacting with a
			particular financial service and not some other entity that is spoofing the
			intended service for malicious purposes. This illustrates a
			general security concern for identifiers: potential ambiguity of strings.
			While a machine has no difficulty distinguishing between any two different
			character sequences, it could be very difficult for humans to
			recognize and distinguish identifiers if an application did not limit which
			Unicode characters could be in identifiers. 
			The focus of this specification is mitigation of such issues related
			to the security of identifiers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Deliberately restricting the characters that can be used in identifiers 
			is an important security technique. 
			The exclusion of characters from identifiers does not affect the general
			use of those characters for other purposes, such as for general text in documents. 
			Unicode Standard Annex #31,
			&quot;Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax&quot; [<a href="#UAX31">UAX31</a>]
			provides a recommended method of determining which strings should
			qualify as identifiers. The UAX #31 specification extends the common
			practice of defining identifiers in terms of letters and numbers to
			the Unicode repertoire.
		</p>
		<p>
			That specification also permits other protocols to use that method as
			a base, and to define a <i> profile</i> that adds or removes
			characters. For example, identifiers for specific programming
			languages typically add some characters like &quot;$&quot;, and
			remove others like &quot;-&quot; (because of the use as <i>minus</i>),
			while IDNA removes &quot;_&quot; (among others)âsee Unicode
				Technical Standard #46, &quot;Unicode IDNA Compatibility
					Processing&quot; [<a href="#UTS46">UTS46</a>], as well as [<a
				href="#IDNA2003">IDNA2003</a>], and [<a href="#IDNA2008">IDNA2008</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			This document provides for additional identifier profiles for
			environments where security is an issue. These are profiles of the
			extended identifiers based on properties and specifications of the
			Unicode Standard [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>], including:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The XID_Start and XID_Continue properties defined in the
				Unicode Character Database (see [<a href="#DCore">DCore</a>])
			</li>
			<li>The toCasefold(X) operation defined in <i>Chapter
					3, Conformance</i> of [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
			</li>
			<li>The NFKC and NFKD normalizations defined in <i>Chapter
						3, Conformance</i> of [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The data files used in defining these profiles follow the UCD File
			Format, which has a semicolon-delimited list of data fields
			associated with given characters, with each field referenced by
			number. For more details, see [<a href="#UCDFormat">UCDFormat</a>].
		</p>
		<h3>
			3.1 <a name="General_Security_Profile"
				href="#General_Security_Profile">General Security Profile for
				Identifiers</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			The files under [<a href="#idmod">idmod</a>] provide data for a profile of
			identifiers in environments where security is at issue. The files
			contain a set of characters recommended to be restricted from use.
			They also contain a small set of characters that are recommended as
			additions to the list of characters defined by the XID_Start and
			XID_Continue properties, because they may be used in identifiers in a
			broader context than programming identifiers.
		</p>
		<p>The Restricted characters are characters not in common use, and
			they can be blocked to further reduce the possibilities for visual
			confusion. They include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>characters not in modern use</li>
			<li>characters only used in specialized fields, such as
				liturgical characters, phonetic letters, and mathematical
				letter-like symbols</li>
			<li>characters in limited use by very small communities</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The choice of which characters to specify as Restricted starts conservatively, but allows additions
			in the future as requirements for characters are refined. 
			For information on handling modifications
			over time, see <i>2.10.1, Backward
				Compatibility</i> in <em>Unicode Technical Report #36,
				&quot;Unicode Security Considerations&quot;</em> [<a href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			An implementation following the General Security Profile does not
			permit any characters in \p{Identifier_Status=Restricted}, unless it documents the
		additional characters that it does allow. Such documentation can specify characters via properties, such as \p{Identifier_Type=Technical}, or by explicit lists, or by combinations of these. Implementations may&nbsp;also specify that fewer characters are allowed than implied by  \p{Identifier_Status=Allowed}; for example, they can allow only characters permitted by [<a
				href="#IDNA2008">IDNA2008</a>].</p>
		<p>Common candidates for such
			additions include characters for scripts listed in <em>Table 7,
			<a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts">Limited Use Scripts</a></em> of [<a href="#UAX31">UAX31</a>]. However,
			characters from these scripts have not been a priority for
			examination for confusables or to determine specialized, non-modern,
			or uncommon-use characters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Canonical equivalence is applied when testing candidate identifiers
			for inclusion of <em>Allowed</em> characters. For example, suppose
			the candidate string is the sequence
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			&lt;u, <em>combining-diaeresis</em>&gt;
		</p>
		<p>
			The target string would be Allowed in <em>either</em> of the
			following 2 situations:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>u is Allowed and Â¨ is Allowed, or</li>
			<li>Ã¼ is Allowed</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type are properties of characters (code points).
			See <i>UTS #18: Unicode Regular Expressions</i> [<a href="#UTS18">UTS18</a>] 
			and <i>UTR #23: The Unicode Character Property Model</i> [<a href="#UTR23">UTR23</a>] for
			more discussion.
			For the purpose of regular expressions,
			the long and short names of these properties and their values
			are documented in their respective data files;
			see <i>Section 7, <a href="#Data_Files">Data Files</a></i>.</p>

		<p>For stability considerations, see <a href="#Migrating_Persistent_Data">Migrating
		Persistent Data</a>.</p>
		<p>
			There may be multiple reasons for restricting a character; therefore,
			the Identifier_Type property allows multiple  values that correspond with
			Restricted. For example, some characters have Identifier_Type values of
			Limited_Use and Technical. Multiple values are not assigned to characters with strong restrictions: Not_Character, Deprecated, Default_Ignorable, Not_NFKC. For 
			example, if a character is Deprecated, there is little value in also 
			marking it as Uncommon_Use. For  the qualifiers on usage, Obsolete, 
			Uncommon_Use and Technical, the distinctions among the Identifier_Type values is not strict and
			only one might be given. The important characteristic is the Identifier_Status:
			whether or not the character is Restricted.
		</p>
		<p>The default Identifier_Type property value should be Uncommon_Use if no other categories apply.
		</p>
		<p> <em>As more
				information is gathered about characters, this data may change in
				successive versions.</em> That can cause either the Identifier_Status
			or Identifier_Type to change for a particular character. Thus users of
			this data should be prepared for changes in successive versions, such
			as by having a grandfathering policy in place for previously
			supported characters or registrations. Both Identifier_Status
			and Identifier_Type values are to be compared
			case-insensitively and ignoring hyphens and underbars.
		</p>
		<p>
			Restricted characters should be treated with caution when considering possible use in identifiers,
			and should be disallowed unless there is good reason to allow them in the
			environment in question. However, the set of Identifier_Status=Allowed
			characters are not typically used as is by implementations. Instead,
			they are applied as filters to the set of characters C that are
			supported by the identifier syntax, generating a new set Câ².
			Typically there are also particular characters or classes of
			characters from C that are retained as <strong>Exception</strong>
			characters.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			Câ² = (C â© {Identifier_Status=Allowed}) âª <strong>Exception</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The implementation may simply restrict use of new identifiers to Câ²,
			or may apply some other strategy. For example, there might be an
			appeal process for registrations of ids that contain characters
			outside of Câ² (but still inside of C), or in user interfaces for
			lookup of identifiers, warnings of some kind may be appropriate. For
			more information, see [<a href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			The <strong>Exception</strong> characters would be
			implementation-specific. For example, a particular implementation
			might extend the default Unicode identifier syntax by adding <strong>Exception</strong>
			characters with the Unicode property <em>XID_Continue=False</em>,
			such as â$â, â-â, and â.â. Those characters are specific to that
			identifier syntax, and would be retained even though they are not in
			the Identifier_Status=Allowed set. Some
			implementations may also wish to add some [<a href="#CLDR">CLDR</a>]
			exemplar characters for particular supported languages that have
			unusual characters.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Identifier_Type=Inclusion characters already
			contain some characters that are not letters or numbers, but that are
			used within words in some languages. For example, it is recommended
			that U+00B7 (Â·) MIDDLE DOT be allowed in identifiers, because it is
			required for Catalan.
		</p>
		<p>The implementation may also apply other restrictions discussed
			in this document, such as checking for confusable characters or doing
			mixed-script detection.</p>
	  <h3>3.1.1 <a name="Joining_Controls" href="#Joining_Controls">Joining Controls</a></h3>

				<p>
			Visible distinctions
			created by certain characters excluded by the
			General Security Profile because their Identifier_Type is Default_Ignorable (particularly the <i>Join_Control
				characters</i>) are necessary in certain languages. A blanket exclusion
			of these characters makes it impossible to create identifiers with
			the correct visual appearance for common words or phrases in those
			languages.
		</p>
		<p>
			Identifier systems that attempt to provide more natural
			representations of terms in &quot;modern, customary usage&quot;
			should allow these characters in input and display, but limit them to
			contexts in which they are necessary. The term <em>modern
				customary usage</em> includes characters that are in common use in
			newspapers, journals, lay publications; on street signs; in
			commercial signage; and as part of common geographic names and
			company names, and so on. It does not include technical or academic
			usage such as in mathematical expressions, using archaic scripts or
			words, or pedagogical use (such as illustration of half-forms or
			joining forms in isolation), or liturgical use.
		</p>
		<p>The goals for such a restriction of format characters to
			particular contexts are to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allow the use of these characters where required in normal
				text</li>
			<li>Exclude as many cases as possible where no visible
				distinction results</li>
			<li>Be simple enough to be easily implemented with standard
				mechanisms such as regular expressions</li>
		</ul>

		<p>An implementation following the General Security Profile that allows the additional characters ZWJ and ZWNJ shall only permit them where they 
			satisfy the conditions A1, A2, and B in <em>Section 3.1.1.1, <a href="#Limited_Contexts_for_Joining_Controls">Limited Contexts for Joiner Controls</a></em>, unless it documents the
		additional contexts where it allows them.</p>
		<p>More advanced implementations may use script-specific information for more detailed testing. In particular, they can:</p>
		<p>1. <em>Disallow joining controls</em> in sequences that meet the conditions of A1, A2, and B, where in common fonts the resulting appearance of the sequence is normally not distinct from appearance in the same sequences with the joining controls removed.</p>
		<p>2. <em>Allow joining controls</em> in sequences that don't meet the conditions of A1, A2, and B,  where in common fonts the resulting appearance of the sequence is normally distinct from the appearance in the same sequences with the joining controls removed. The following regular expressions describe sequences that typically result in distinct rendering. They use the notation explained below in <a href="#A1">A1</a>.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>/$L ZWNJ $V $L/</p>
	  		<p>/$L ZWJ $V $L/</p>

		</p>
		<blockquote>

		<p>
			There are also two global conditions incorporated in each of <a

		<p>
			This corresponds to the following regular expression (in Perl-style

			While the restrictions in <a href="#A1">A1</a>, <a

			limit visual confusability, they do not prevent it. For example,

		than specified in <i>Section 3.1.1.2, <a
				href="#Limited_Contexts_for_Joining_Controls">Limited Contexts for Joining Controls</a></i>âfor example, by explicitly providing for the exceptional sequence, while otherwise disallowing the joiner in context.</p>
		<p>There are also cases where a joiner preceding a

		<p>
			<b><em>Performance.</em></b> Parsing identifiers can be a

		<p>
			The <em>SMTP Extension for Internationalized Email</em> provides for specifications of internationalized email addresses [<a href="#EAI">EAI</a>]. However, it does not provide for testing those addresses for security issues. This section provides an email security profile that  may be used for that. It can be applied for different purposes, such as:<br>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>When an email address is registered, flag anything that
				does not meet the profile:
				<ul>
					<li>Either forbid the registration, or</li>
					<li>Allow for an appeals process.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When an email address is detected in linkification of plain
				text:
				<ul>
					<li>Do not linkify if the identifier does not meet
						the profile.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When an email address is displayed in incoming email:
				<ul>
					<li>Flag it as suspicious with a wavy underline, if it
						does not meet the profile.</li>
					<li>Filter characters from the quoted-string-part to prevent
					display problems.
	      </li>
				</ul>
		  </li>
		</ol>
				  <p>This profile does not exclude characters from
				EAI. Instead, it provides a profile that can be used for registration, linkification,
				and notification. The goal is to  flag 
				    addresses that are structurally unsound or contain unexpected detritus.</p>
	    <p>An email address is formed from three main parts. (There are more elements of an email address, but these are the ones for which Unicode security is important.) For example:</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>&quot;Joey&quot; &lt;joe31834@gmail.com&gt;</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The <strong>domain-part</strong> is &quot;gmail.com&quot;</li>
		    <li>The <strong>local-part</strong> is &quot;joe31834&quot;</li>
		    <li>The <strong>quoted-string-part</strong> is &quot;Joey&quot;</li>
	      </ul>
	  </blockquote>
		<p>To meet the requirements of the <strong>Email Security Profiles for Identifiers</strong> section of this specification, an identifier must satisfy the following
		  conditions for the specified &lt;restriction level&gt;.</p>
        <h4>Domain-Part</h4>
      <p>The domain-part of an email address must satisfy <i>Section 3.2, <a

      <p>That is, dots can also occur in the local-part, but

              <h4>Quoted-String-Part</h4>

        <p>The quoted-string-part of an email address  must
          satisfy the following conditions:
          
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>It must be in NFC.</li>
          <li>It must not contain any stateful bidirectional format characters.
            
            <ul>
              <li>That is, no [:bidicontrol:] except for the LRM, RLM, and ALM, since the bidirectional controls could influence the ordering of characters outside
              the quotes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>It must not contain more than four nonspacing marks in a row, and no
            sequence of two of the same nonspacing marks.</li>
          <li>It may contain mixed scripts, symbols (including emoji),
            and so on.
          </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Other Issues</h4>

		<p>The restrictions above are insufficient to
			prevent bidirectional-reordering that could intermix the quoted-string-part
			with the local-part or the domain-part in display. To prevent that,
			implementations could use bidirectional isolates (or equivalent) around the
			each of these parts in display.</p>
		<p>Implementations may also want to use other checks, such as for confusability, or services such as Safe Browsing.</p>
		<p>
			A serious practical issue is that clients do not know what the
			identity rules are for any particular email server: that is, when two
			email addresses are considered equivalent. For example, are <em>mark@macchiato.com</em>
			and <em>Mark@macchiato.com</em> treated the same by the server?
			Unfortunately, there is no way to query a server to see
			what identity rules it follows. One of the techniques used to deal with
			this problem is having whitelists of email providers indicating which of them are  case-insensitive, dot-insensitive, or both.

		<p>
			The data in [<a href="#confusables">confusables</a>] provide a
			mechanism for determining when two strings are visually confusable.
			The data in these files may be refined and extended over time. For
			information on handling modifications over time, see <i>Section
					2.10.1, Backward Compatibility</i> in Unicode Technical Report #36,
			&quot;Unicode Security Considerations&quot; [<a href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>]
			and the <a href="#Migration">Migration</a> section of this document.
		</p>
		<p>
			Collection of data for detecting gatekeeper-confusable strings is not
			currently a goal for the confusable detection mechanism in this
			document. For more information, see <em>Section 2, Visual
				Security Issues</em> in [<a href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>].
		</p>
		<p>The data provides a mapping from source characters to their prototypes. A prototype should be thought of as a sequence of one or more classes of symbols, where each class has an exemplar character. For example, the character U+0153 (Å), LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE, has a prototype consisting of two symbol classes: the one with exemplar character U+006F (o), and the one with exemplar character U+0065 (e). If an input character does not have a prototype explicitly defined in the data file, the prototype is assumed to consist of the class of symbols with the input character as the exemplar character.</p>
		<p>For an input string X, define <a name="def-internalSkeleton" href="#def-internalSkeleton">internalSkeleton</a>(X) to be the following transformation on the string: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Convert X to NFD format, as described in [<a
				href="#UAX15">UAX15</a>].
			</li>
			<li>Remove any characters in X that have the property Default_Ignorable_Code_Point.</li>
			<li>Concatenate the prototypes for each character in X according to the specified data, producing a string of exemplar characters.</li>
			<li>Reapply NFD.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>For an input string X and a direction ð â {RTL, LTR, FS}, define bidiSkeleton(ð, X) to be the following transformation on the string:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Reorder the code points in X for display by applying the rules of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [<a href="#UAX9">UAX9</a>] up to and including L2, treating X in isolation; if ðâ FS, apply protocol HL1 to set the paragraph level to 1 if ð=RTL, and to 0 if ð=LTR; this yields the reordered sequence of characters R.</li>
		<li>Apply rule L3 of the UBA: move combining marks after their base in R; this yields the sequence Râ².</li>
		<li>Replace any character whose glyph would be mirrored by rule L4 of the UBA by the value of its Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property, yielding Râ³.</li>
		<li>bidiSkeleton(ð, X) is then internalSkeleton(Râ³).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The strings X and Y are defined to be ð-confusable if and only if bidiSkeleton(ð, X) = bidiSkeleton(ð, Y). This is abbreviated as X â Y (ð).</p>
		<p>This mechanism imposes transitivity on the data, so if X â Y (ð) and Y â Z (ð), then X â Z (ð). It is possible to provide a more sophisticated confusable detection, by providing a metric between given characters, indicating their &quot;closeness.&quot; However, that is computationally much more expensive, and requires more sophisticated data, so at this point in time the simpler mechanism has been chosen. That means that in some cases the test may be overly inclusive.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<b>Note:</b> The operation <em>internalSkeleton</em> may change the Bidi_Class of characters, so it does not commute with the reordering and mirroring steps, and needs to be performed after them.

		<p>Note that these sequences are not RTL-confusable; indeed in a right-to-left paragraph, the strings look distinct:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Sâ = "<span dir="rtl">A1&lt;×©×</span>"<br>
			Sâ = "<span dir="rtl">Î×©Öº&gt;1</span>"
		</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
		LTR, and RTL, and FS confusability should be used when it is inappropriate to enforce that strings be single-script,
		or at least single-directionality; this is the case in programming language identifiers.
		See <i>Section 5.1, Confusability Mitigation Diagnostics</i>, in
		<i>Unicode Technical Standard #55, Unicode Source Code Handling</i> [<a href="#UTS55">UTS55</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
		The bidiSkeleton is costlier to compute than the internalSkeleton, as the bidirectional algorithm must be applied.
		However, a fast path can be used: if ð=LTR and X has no characters with bidi classes R or AL, bidiSkeleton(ð, X) = internalSkeleton(X).
		</p>
		<p>
		Further, if the strings are known not to contain explicit directional formatting characters (as is the case for UAX31-R1 Default Identifiers
		defined in <i>Unicode Standard Annex #31, Identifiers and Syntax</i> [<a href="#UAX31">UAX31</a>]), the algorithm can be drastically simplified,
		as the X rules are trivial, obviating the need for the directional status stack of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.
		The highest possible resolved level is then 2; see <i>Table 5, Resolving Implicit Levels</i>,
		in <i>Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</i> [<a href="#UAX9">UAX9</a>].
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> The strings <i>bidiSkeleton</i>(ð, X) and <i>bidiSkeleton</i>(ð, Y)
				are <b><i>not</i></b> intended for display. 
				Further, they are not stable across versions of Unicode, so that
				they can only be interchanged between systems that use the same version of Unicode to compute <i>bidiSkeleton</i>.
				If they are stored, they must be recomputed when updating the version of Unicode used to compute <i>bidiSkeleton</i>.
				They should be thought of as an intermediate processing form,
				similar to a hashcode. The exemplar characters are <b><i>not</i></b> guaranteed to be identifier characters.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
		The use of bidirectional confusability with an appropriate direction is preferable when possible.
			However, for cases where the direction with which identifiers will be displayed is unknown,
			and for compatibility with earlier definitions of confusability which did not take bidirectional reordering into account,
			the operation <a name="def-skeleton" href="#def-skeleton">skeleton</a> is
			defined as skeleton(X) = bidiSkeleton(LTR, X). The strings X and Y are then
			defined to be <a name="def-confusable" href="#def-confusable">confusable</a> if and only if skeleton(X) = skeleton(Y). This is abbreviated as X â Y.
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<b>Note:</b> Some implementations of confusable detection outside Unicode use different terminology.
			In particular, in the ICANN Root Zone Label Generation Rules [<a href="#RZLGR5">RZLGR5</a>], the term
			<em>variant of X</em> is used for a property similar to <em>confusable with X</em>, and the term
			<em>index variant</em> is used for the equivalent of <em>skeleton</em>.
		</blockquote>

	  <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
			<p>Confusables are divided into three classes: single-script confusables, mixed-script confusables, and whole-script confusables, defined below.  All confusables are either a single-script confusable or a mixed-script confusable, but not both.  All whole-script confusables are also mixed-script confusables.</p>
			<p>The definitions of these three classes of confusables depend on the definitions of <em>resolved script set</em> and <em>single-script</em>, which are provided in <i>Section 5, <a href="#Mixed_Script_Detection">Mixed-Script
			Detection</a></i>. </p>
			<p>
				X and Y are <i><a name="single_script_confusables"

				<p>Examples:				âÇetoâ and âljetoâ in Latin (the Croatian word for âsummerâ), where the first word uses only four codepoints, the first of which is U+01C9 (Ç) LATIN SMALL LETTER LJ.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				X and Y are <i><a name="mixed_script_confusables"

			<blockquote>
				<p>Example: &quot;scope&quot; in Latin and &quot;ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐµ&quot; in Cyrillic.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
		<p>As noted in Section 5, the resolved script set ignores characters with Script_Extensions {Common} and {Inherited} and augments characters with CJK scripts with their respective writing systems. Characters with the Script_Extension property values COMMON or
			INHERITED are ignored when testing for differences in script.</p>
		<h3>Data File Format</h3>
		<p>Each line in the data file has the following format: Field 1 is
		  the source, Field 2 is the target, and Field 3 is obsolete, always containing the letters âMAâ for backwards compatibility. For example:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>
			0441 ; 0063 ; MA # ( Ñ â c ) CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER ES â LATIN SMALL
			LETTER C #
		</p>
		<p>2CA5 ; 0063 ; MA # ( â²¥ â c ) COPTIC SMALL LETTER SIMA â LATIN
			SMALL LETTER C # âÏ²â</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Everything after the # is a comment and is purely informative. A
			asterisk after the comment indicates that the character is not an XID
			character [<a href="#UAX31">UAX31</a>]. The comments provide the
		character names.</p>
		<p>Implementations that use the confusable data do not have to
			recursively apply the mappings, because the transforms are
		idempotent. That is,</p>
        <p align="center"> <i>skeleton(skeleton(X)) = skeleton(X)</i></p>
		<p>If the data was derived via transitivity, there is
			an extra comment at the end. For instance, in the above example the
			derivation was: </p>
		<ol>
		  <li>â²¥ (U+2CA5 COPTIC SMALL LETTER SIMA)</li>
			<li>â Ï² (U+03F2 GREEK LUNATE SIGMA SYMBOL)</li>
			<li>â c (U+0063 LATIN SMALL LETTER C)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To reduce security risks, it is advised that identifiers use
			casefolded forms, thus eliminating uppercase variants where possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			The data may change between versions. Even where the data is the
			same, the order of lines in the files may change between versions.

			4.1 <a name="Whole_Script_Confusables"
				href="#Whole_Script_Confusables">Whole-Script Confusables</a>
		</h3>
	  <p>For some applications, it is useful to determine if a given input string has any whole-script confusable.  For example, the identifier &quot;ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐµ&quot; using Cyrillic characters would pass the single-script test described in <em>Section 5.2,Â <a href="#Restriction_Level_Detection">Restriction-Level Detection</a></em>, even though it is likely to be a spoof attempt.
	  <p>It is possible to determine whether a single-script string X has a whole-script confusable:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li> Consider Q, the set of all strings that are confusable with X. </li>
	    <li>Remove all strings from Q whose resolved script set intersects with the resolved script set of X.</li>
	    <li>If Q is nonempty and contains any single-script string, return TRUE.</li>
	    <li>Otherwise, return FALSE.	  </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>The logical description above can be used for a reference implementation for testing, but is not particularly efficient. A production implementation can be optimized as long as it produces the same results.	  </p>
	  <p>Note that the confusables data include a large number of mappings between Latin and Cyrillic text.  For this reason, the above algorithm is likely to flag a large number of legitimate strings written in Latin or Cyrillic as potential whole-script confusables. To effectively use whole-script confusables, it is often useful to  determine both  whether a string has a whole-script confusable, and  <em>which</em> scripts those whole-script confusables have.</p>
	  <p>This information can be used, for example, to distinguish between reasonable versus suspect whole-script confusables. Consider the Latin-script domain-name label &ldquo;circle&rdquo;. It would be appropriate to have that  in the domain name &ldquo;circle.com&rdquo;. It would also be appropriate to have the Cyrillic confusable &ldquo;ÑÑÐ³ÑÓÐµ&rdquo;  in the Cyrillic domain name &ldquo;ÑÑÐ³ÑÓÐµ.ÑÑ&rdquo;. However, a browser may want to alert the user to possible spoofs if  the Cyrillic &ldquo;ÑÑÐ³ÑÓÐµ&rdquo; is used with .com or the Latin &ldquo;circle&rdquo; is used with .ÑÑ.</p>
	  <p>The process of determining suspect usage of whole-script confusables is more complicated than simply looking at the scripts of the labels in a domain name. For example, it can be perfectly legitimate to have  scripts in a SLD (second level domain) not be the same as scripts in a TLD (top-level domain), such as:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Cyrillic labels in a domain name with a TLD of .ru or .ÑÑ
        </li>
	    <li>Chinese labels in a domain name with a TLD of .com.au or .com
        </li>
	    <li>Cyrillic labels <em>that aren&rsquo;t confusable</em> with Latin with a TLD of .com.au or .com	  </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>The following high-level algorithm can be used to determine all scripts that contain a whole-script confusable with a string X:	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Consider Q, the set of all strings confusable with X.
        </li>
	    <li>Remove all strings from Q whose resolved script set is â or <strong>ALL</strong> (that is, keep only single-script strings plus  those with characters only in Common). </li>
	    <li>Take the union of the resolved script sets of all strings remaining in Q.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>As usual, this algorithm is intended only as a definition; implementations should use an optimized routine that produces the same result.	  </p>

			5.3 <a name="Mixed_Number_Detection" href="#Mixed_Number_Detection">Mixed-Number
				Detection</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are three different types of numbers in Unicode. Only numbers
			with General_Category = Decimal_Numbers (Nd) should be allowed in
			identifiers. However, characters from different decimal number
			systems can be easily confused. For example, <a target="c"
				href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0660">U+0660</a> (Â Ù Â )
			ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO can be confused with <a target="c"
				href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=06F0">U+06F0</a> (Â Û°Â )
			EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO, and <a target="c"
				href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=09EA">U+09EA</a> (Â à§ªÂ )
			BENGALI DIGIT FOUR can be confused with <a target="c"
				href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0038">U+0038</a> (Â 8Â )
		DIGIT EIGHT. There are other reasons for disallowing mixed number systems in identifiers, just as there are for mixing scripts.</p>
		<p>For a given input string which does not contain non-decimal
			numbers, the logical process of detecting mixed numbers is the
			following:</p>
		<p>For each character in the string:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Find the decimal number value for that character, if any.</li>
			<li>Map the value to the unique zero character for that number
				system.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If there is more than one such zero character, then the string
			contains multiple decimal number systems.</p>
		<p>
			The actual implementation of this algorithm can be optimized; as
			usual, the specification only depends on the results. The following
			Java sample using [<a href="#ICU">ICU</a>] shows how this can be done
			:
		</p>
		<pre>
    public UnicodeSet getNumberRepresentatives(String identifier) {<br>        int cp;<br>        UnicodeSet numerics = new UnicodeSet();<br>        for (int i = 0; i &lt; identifier.length(); i += Character.charCount(i)) {<br>            cp = Character.codePointAt(identifier, i);<br>            // Store a representative character for each kind of decimal digit<br>            switch (UCharacter.getType(cp)) {<br>            case UCharacterCategory.DECIMAL_DIGIT_NUMBER:<br>                // Just store the zero character as a representative for comparison. <br>                // Unicode guarantees it is cp - value.<br>                numerics.add(cp - UCharacter.getNumericValue(cp));<br>                break;<br>            case UCharacterCategory.OTHER_NUMBER:<br>            case UCharacterCategory.LETTER_NUMBER:<br>                throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Should not be in identifiers.&quot;);<br>            }<br>        } <br>        return numerics;<br>    }

		<h2>6 <a name="Development_Process" href="#Development_Process">Development
				Process</a></h2>
		<p>
			As discussed in Unicode Technical
				Report #36, &quot;Unicode Security Considerations&quot; [<a
				href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>], confusability among characters cannot be
			an exact science. There are many factors that make confusability a
			matter of degree:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Shapes of characters vary greatly among fonts used to
				represent them. The Unicode Standard uses representative glyphs in
				the code charts, but font designers are free to create their own
				glyphs.Â Because fonts can easily be created using an arbitrary glyph
				to represent any Unicode code point, character confusability with
				arbitrary fonts can never be avoided. For example, one could design
				a font where the âaâ looks like a âbâ , âcâ like a âdâ, and so on.</li>
			<li>Writing systems using contextual shaping (such as Arabic and many South Asian systems) introduce even more variation in text
				rendering. Characters do not really have an abstract shape in
				isolation and are only rendered as part of cluster of characters
				making words, expressions, and sentences. It is a fairly common
				occurrence to find the same visual text representation corresponding
				to very different logical words that can only be recognized by
				context, if at all.</li>
			<li>Font style variants such as italics may introduce a
				confusability which does not exist in another style. For example, in
				the Cyrillic script, the <a target="c"
				href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0442">U+0442</a> (Â ÑÂ )
				CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER TE looks like a small caps Latin âTâ in normal
				style, while it looks like a small Latin âmâ in italic style.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In-script confusability is extremely user-dependent. For example, in
			the Latin script, characters with accents or appendices may look
			similar to the unadorned characters for some users, especially if
			they are not familiar with their meaning in a particular language.
			However, most users will have at least a minimum understanding of the
			range of characters in their own script, and there are separate
			mechanisms available to deal with other scripts, as discussed in [<a
				href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			As described elsewhere, there are cases where the confusable data may
			be different than expected. Sometimes this is because two characters
			or two strings may only be confusable in some fonts. In other cases,
			it is because of transitivity. For example, the dotless and dotted I
			are considered equivalent (Ä± â i), because they look the same when
			accents such as an <i>acute</i> are applied to each. However, for
			practical implementation usage, transitivity is sufficiently
			important that some oddities are accepted.
		</p>
		<p>
			The data may be enhanced in future versions of this
				specification. For information on handling changes in data over
				time, see <i>2.10.1, Backward Compatibility</i> of [<a href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>].
		</p>
		<h3>
			6.1 <a name="Data_Collection" href="#Data_Collection">Confusables Data Collection</a>
		</h3>
		<p>The confusability data was created by collecting a number of
			prospective confusables, examining those confusables according to a
			set of common fonts, and processing the result for transitive
			closure.</p>
		<p>
			The primary goal is to include characters that would be Identifier_Status=Allowed
			as in <em>Table 1, <a href="#Identifier_Status_and_Type">
					Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type</a></em>. Other characters, such as NFKC
			variants, are not a primary focus for data collection. However, such
			variants may certainly be included in the data, and may be submitted
			using the online forms at [<a href="#Feedback">Feedback</a>].
		</p>
		<p>The prospective confusables were gathered from a number of
			sources. Erik van der Poel contributed a list derived from running a
			program over a large number of fonts to catch characters that shared
			identical glyphs within a font, and Mark Davis did the same more
			recently for fonts on Windows and the Macintosh. Volunteers from
			Google, IBM, Microsoft and other companies gathered other lists of
			characters. These included native speakers for languages with
			different writing systems. The Unicode compatibility mappings were
			also used as a source. The process of gathering visual confusables is
			ongoing: the Unicode Consortium welcomes submission of additional
			mappings. The complex scripts of South and Southeast Asia need
			special attention. The focus is on characters that have Identifier_Status=Allowed, because they are of most
			concern.</p>
		<p>The fonts used to assess the confusables included those used by
			the major operating systems in user interfaces. In addition, the
			representative glyphs used in the Unicode Standard were also
			considered. Fonts used for the user interface in operating systems
			are an important source, because they are the ones that will usually
			be seen by users in circumstances where confusability is important,
			such such as when using IRIS (Internationalized Resource Identifiers)
			and their sub-elements (such as domain names). These fonts have a
			number of other relevant characteristics:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They rarely changed in updates to operating systems and
				applications; changes brought by system upgrades tend to be gradual
				to avoid usability disruption.</li>
			<li>Because user interface elements need to be legible at low
				screen resolution (implying a low number of pixels per EM), fonts
				used in these contexts tend to be designed in sans-serif style,
				which has the tendency to increase the possibility of confusables.
				There are, however, some languages such as Chinese where a serif
				style is in common use.</li>
			<li>Strict bounding box requirements create even more
				constraints for scripts which use relatively large ascenders and
				descenders. This also limits space allocated for accent or tone
				marks, and can also create more opportunities for confusability.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Pairs of prospective confusables were removed if they were always
			visually distinct at common sizes, both within and across fonts. The
			data was then closed under transitivity, so that if XâY and YâZ, then
			XâZ. In addition, the data was closed under substring operations, so
			that if XâY then AXBâAYB. It was then processed to produce the
			in-script and cross-script data, so that a single data table can be
			used to map an input string to a resulting <i>skeleton</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			A skeleton is intended <i>only</i> for internal use for testing
			confusability of strings; the resulting text is not suitable for
			display to users, because it will appear to be a hodgepodge of
			different scripts. In particular, the result of mapping an identifier
			will not necessary be an identifier. Thus the confusability mappings
			can be used to test whether two identifiers are confusable (if their
			skeletons are the same), but should definitely not be used as a
			&quot;normalization&quot; of identifiers.
		</p>
		<h3>
			6.2 <a name="IDMOD_Data_Collection" href="#IDMOD_Data_Collection">Identifier
				Modification Data Collection</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <strong>idmod</strong> data is gathered in the following way. The
			basic assignments are derived based on UCD character properties,
			information in [<a href="#UAX31">UAX31</a>], and a curated list of
			exceptions based on information from various sources, including the
			core specification of the Unicode Standard, annotations in the code
			charts, information regarding CLDR exemplar characters, and external
			feedback.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first condition that matches in the order of the items from top
			to bottom in <a href="#Identifier_Status_and_Type">Table 1.
				Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type</a> is used, with a few exceptions:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>When a character is in

				href="#UAX31">UAX31</a>], then it is given the Identifier_Type=Inclusion,
			regardless of other properties. </li>

				<p>The format for IdentifierStatus.txt follows the normal conventions for 
					UCD data files, and is described in the header of that file. 
					All characters not listed in the file default to Identifier_Status=Restricted. 
					Thus the file only  lists characters with Identifier_Status=Allowed. 
					For example:</p>
                <p><code>002D..002E ; Allowed # 1.1 HYPHEN-MINUS..FULL STOP</code></p>
                <p>The format for IdentifierType.txt follows the normal conventions for UCD 
                	data files, and is described in the header of that file. The value is a 
                	set whose elements are delimited by spaces. This format is identical to 
                	that used for ScriptExtensions.txt. This differs from prior versions
                	 which only listed the strongest reason for exclusion. This new convention 
                	 allows the values to be used for more nuanced filtering. For example, 
                	 if an implementation wants to allow an Exclusion script, it could still 
                	 exclude Obsolete and Not_XID characters in that script. 
                	 All characters not listed in the file default to Identifier_Type=Not_Character. 
                	 For example:</p>
                <p><code>2460..24EA ; Technical Not_XID Not_NFKC # 1.1 CIRCLED DIGIT ONE..CIRCLED DIGIT ZERO</code></p>

                <p>Both of these files have machine-readable <code># @missing</code> lines
                for the default property values, as in many UCD files.

		<h3>
			<a name="Migrating_Persistent_Data" href="#Migrating_Persistent_Data">Migrating
				Persistent Data</a>
		</h3>

		<p>Implementations must migrate their persistent data stores (such
			as database indexes) whenever those implementations update to use the
			data files from a new version of this specification.</p>
		<p>Stability is never guaranteed between versions, although it is
			maintained where feasible. In particular, an updated version of
			confusable mapping data may use a mapping for a particular character
			that is different from the mapping used for that character in an
			earlier version. Thus there may be cases where X â Y in Version N,
			and X â Z in Version N+1, where Z may or may not have mapped to Y in
			Version N. Even in cases where the logical data has not changed
			between versions, the order of lines in the data files may have been
			changed.</p>
		<p>The Identifier_Status does not have stability guarantees (such as âOnce a character is Allowed, it will not become Restricted in future versionsâ), because the data is changing over time as we find out more about character usage. Certain of the Identifier_Type values, such as Not_XID, are backward compatible but most may change as new data becomes available. The identifier data may also not appear to be completely consistent when just viewed from the perspective of script and general category. For example, it may well be that one character out of a set of nonspacing marks in a script is Restricted, while others are not. But that can be just a reflection of the fact that that character is obsolete and the others are not.</p>
		<p>For identifier lookup, the data is aimed more at flagging possibly questionable characters, thus serving as one factor (among perhaps many, like using the &quot;Safe Browsing&quot; service) in determining whether the user should be notified in some way. For registration, flagged characters can result in a &quot;soft no&quot;, that is, require the user to appeal a denial with more information.</p>
		<p>For dealing with characters whose status changes to Restricted, implementations can use a grandfathering mechanism  to maintain backwards compatibility.</p>
		<p>Implementations should therefore have a strategy for migrating
			their persistent data stores (such as database indexes) that use any
			of the confusable mapping data or other data files.</p>
		<h3><a name="Version_13_Migration" href="#Version_13_Migration">Version 13.0 Migration</a> </h3>
        <p>As of Unicode 13.0, the Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type are consistently written with underbars. This may cause  parsers  to malfunction, those that do not follow Unicode conventions for matching of property names.</p>
      <h3>

		<h3>
			<a name="Version_7_Migration" href="#Version_7_Migration">Version
				7.0 Migration</a><a name="Updating_Required"></a>
		</h3>
		<p>Due to production problems, versions of the confusable mapping
			tables before 7.0 did not maintain idempotency in all cases, so
			updating to version 8.0 is strongly advised.</p>
		<p>Anyone using the skeleton mappings needs to rebuild any
			persistent uses of skeletons, such as in database indexes.</p>
		<p>The SL, SA, and ML mappings in 7.0 were significantly changed
			to address the idempotency problem. However, the tables SL, SA, and
			ML were still problematic, and discouraged from use in 7.0. They were
			thus removed from version 8.0.</p>
		<p>All of the data necessary for an implementation to recreate the
			removed tables is available in the remaining data (MA) plus the
			Unicode Character Database properties (script, casing, etc.). Such a
			recreation would examine each of the equivalence classes from the MA
			data, and filter out instances that did not fit the constraints (of
			script or casing). For the target character, it would choose the most
			neutral character, typically a symbol. However, the reasons for
			deprecating them still stand, so it is not recommended that
			implementations recreate them.</p>
		<p>
			Note also that as the Script_Extensions data is made more complete,
			it may cause characters in the whole-script confusables data file to
			no longer match. For more information, see <em>Section 4, <a
				href="#Confusable_Detection">Confusable Detection</a></em>.
