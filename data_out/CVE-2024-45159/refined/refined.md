{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of certificate validation in TLS 1.3 when optional client authentication is enabled. Specifically, the `mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result()` function fails to properly check the `keyUsage` and `extKeyUsage` extensions of the client certificate. It does not set the `MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE` and `MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_EXT_KEY_USAGE` bits when these extensions are invalid.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect certificate validation",
      "Improper handling of key usage extensions"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with a certificate valid for other purposes, but not specifically for TLS client authentication, could bypass the authentication check and potentially gain unauthorized access or privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a TLS client connecting to a TLS 1.3 server that has optional client authentication enabled. The client presents a certificate that is valid except for the `keyUsage` and `extKeyUsage` extensions.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a certificate signed by a trusted CA of the server and needs to control the client side of a TLS connection."
  },
  "affected_versions": "Mbed TLS versions 3.2.0 up to and including 3.6.0 are affected.",
  "fixed_versions": "Mbed TLS 3.6.1 and later versions contain the fix.",
  "workarounds": "A workaround is to force the use of TLS 1.2 for connections that use optional client authentication. This can be achieved by calling `mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_tls_version(..., MBEDTLS_SSL_VERSION_TLS1_2);`."
