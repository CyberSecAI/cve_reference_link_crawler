  "CVE-2022-2097": {
    "description": "AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimized implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.",
    "root_cause": "The AES OCB mode implementation for 32-bit x86 platforms with AES-NI assembly optimization does not correctly encrypt all data under certain conditions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete encryption",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of 16 bytes of data. In the case of in-place encryption, 16 bytes of plaintext could be revealed. This can expose sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered when using AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms with AES-NI assembly optimized implementation."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to use vulnerable software configured to use AES OCB encryption mode on a 32 bit x86 platform with AES-NI."
