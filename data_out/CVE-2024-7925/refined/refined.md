Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of the `phpinfo()` function in the `eginfo.php` file within the ZZCMS 2023 software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the presence of the `phpinfo()` function, which, when executed, outputs a large amount of sensitive system and PHP configuration information.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerability is triggered when accessing `/3/E_bak5.1/upload/eginfo.php` with the `phome=ShowPHPInfo` parameter via a GET request. It appears that the access is only restricted by requiring a user to be logged in, which is insufficient to prevent this type of information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The `phpinfo()` output reveals crucial details, including server paths, PHP version, loaded extensions, environment variables, and potentially database credentials and other sensitive data. This information can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the system and its configuration, which can be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability using a simple HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL: `/3/E_bak5.1/upload/eginfo.php?phome=ShowPHPInfo`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be logged into the ZZCMS application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ZZCMS installation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects ZZCMS version 2023.
- The vulnerable file is located at `/3/E_bak5.1/upload/eginfo.php`
- The vulnerability is triggered by passing `phome=ShowPHPInfo` as a GET parameter.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using the specified URL and parameter.
