# Improper Authentication in Arvados when using PAM as identity provider

High

[tetron](/tetron)
published
GHSA-87jr-xwhg-cxjv
Sep 22, 2022

## Package

arvados
(arvados)

## Affected versions

<= 2.4.2

## Patched versions

2.4.3

## Description

### Impact

In Arvados 2.4.2 and earlier, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados.

Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw.

### Patches

From 2.4.3 onwards, Arvados now also checks that the account is permitted to access the host before completing the PAM login process.

### Workarounds

Migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.
