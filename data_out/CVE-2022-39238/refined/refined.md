- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from improper authentication logic when using PAM (Portable Authentication Modules) in Arvados. Specifically, the system did not check if a user account was allowed to access the host after successful authentication with PAM credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is an improper authentication check (CWE-287). Arvados only verified that the provided PAM credentials were valid but failed to check if the account was enabled or had other restrictions preventing host access (e.g. expired password).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with valid PAM credentials for a disabled or restricted account could still gain access to Arvados.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the Arvados login interface using PAM authentication. An attacker would need valid PAM credentials for a user that is otherwise restricted from host access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires valid PAM credentials for a user who is disabled or has restrictions preventing host access. They also need network access to the Arvados instance.
