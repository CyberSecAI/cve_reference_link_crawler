The provided content is a security advisory from HiddenLayer, detailing multiple vulnerabilities found in MLflow, including CVE-2024-37052.

**CVE-2024-37052 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Deserialization vulnerability in the `sklearn/__init__.py` file, specifically within the `_load_model_from_local_file` function. This function uses `pickle.load` or `cloudpickle.load` to deserialize model files.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `pickle.load` and `cloudpickle.load` on untrusted data. An attacker can inject a malicious pickle object into a model file.
*   **Impact:** When the model is loaded by a victim using `mlflow.sklearn.load_model`, the malicious pickle object is deserialized, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious pickle object within a scikit-learn model, logs this model to the tracking server using `mlflow.sklearn.log_model`, and then a victim loads the model, triggering the exploit.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and log malicious MLflow models to a tracking server that a victim can access and load models from. The attacker does not need any initial access to the victim's system, but must get the victim to load the malicious model.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including code snippets and example attack scenarios.
*   The advisory also mentions several other related vulnerabilities: CVE-2024-37053, CVE-2024-37054, CVE-2024-37055, CVE-2024-37056, CVE-2024-37057, CVE-2024-37058, CVE-2024-37059, CVE-2024-37060 and CVE-2024-37061. These vulnerabilities all involve the deserialization of untrusted data via pickle or cloudpickle, and result in RCE.
*   The advisory includes the CVSS score for each of the vulnerabilities, which is 8.8 (High).
*   The advisory lists the affected MLflow versions.
