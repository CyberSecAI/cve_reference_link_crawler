| Reproduce InfoBuild Environment Update The `Makefile` within the `test_coap_server` directory has been updated to utilize `clang` with sanitizers.  ```  I1 = ../../lib/include  S1 = ../../lib/src -CC_ ?= gcc -CFLAGS = -Wall \ +CC_ ?= clang +CFLAGS = -Wall -g -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer\           -I $(I1)  CFLAGS += $(IP6_CFLAGS)  CFLAGS += $(DTLS_CFLAGS) -LD_ ?= gcc -LDFLAGS = +LD_ ?= clang +LDFLAGS = -fsanitize=address,undefined  INCS = $(I1)/coap_server.h \         $(I1)/coap_msg.h \         $(I1)/coap_mem.h \ ``` Building test\_coap\_server ``` cd FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_server make dtls=n ``` Run InstructionsStarting the CoAP Server The CoAP server was started using the `test_coap_server` executable:  ``` cd FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_server ./test_coap_server 1234 ``` Sending the Packet Sending packets from the client to the client using a series of hexstreams in： [hexstream.txt](https://github.com/keith-cullen/FreeCoAP/files/15285431/hexstream.txt) Description A null pointer dereference issue was discovered in `coap_client_exchange_blockwise2` function defined in `coap_client.c` at line 1950. The function `coap_msg_get_payload(resp)` returns a null pointer which is then passed to `memcpy` as the source argument, leading to undefined behavior as specified by the C standard. Crash report Here is the UBSan report:  ``` ../../lib/src/coap_client.c:1950:37: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 2, which is declared to never be null /usr/include/string.h:44:28: note: nonnull attribute specified here     #0 0x4d738c in coap_client_exchange_blockwise2 FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_client/../../lib/src/coap_client.c:1950:9     #1 0x4d5c7b in coap_client_exchange_blockwise FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_client/../../lib/src/coap_client.c:1976:15     #2 0x4d1750 in exchange_blockwise FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_client/test_coap_client.c:2316:11     #3 0x4cbb9f in test_exchange_blockwise_func FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_client/test_coap_client.c:2635:15     #4 0x4ef7df in test_run FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_client/../test.c:51:18     #5 0x4c9acc in main FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_client/test_coap_client.c:2963:20     #6 0x7f596c2d20b2 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-eX1tMB/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16     #7 0x41c35d in _start (FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_client/test_coap_client+0x41c35d)  SUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior ../../lib/src/coap_client.c:1950:37 in   ``` |
