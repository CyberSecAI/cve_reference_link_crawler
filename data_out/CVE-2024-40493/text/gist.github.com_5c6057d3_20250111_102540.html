|  | [Suggested description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | Null Pointer Dereference in `coap\_client\_exchange\_blockwise2` function |
|  | in Keith Cullen FreeCoAP 1.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial |
|  | of service and potentially execute arbitrary code via a specially |
|  | crafted CoAP packet that causes `coap\_msg\_get\_payload(resp)` to return |
|  | a null pointer, which is then dereferenced in a call to `memcpy`. |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [VulnerabilityType Other] |
|  | Null Pointer Dereference |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Vendor of Product] |
|  | https://github.com/keith-cullen/FreeCoAP |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Product Code Base] |
|  | An implementation of a CoAP client, a CoAP server and a HTTP/CoAP proxy with full DTLS support. https://github.com/keith-cullen/FreeCoAP - v0.7 |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Component] |
|  | coap\_client\_exchange\_blockwise2 function in coap\_client.c |
|  | memcpy function (issue details can be found in the issue link) (https://github.com/keith-cullen/FreeCoAP/issues/37) |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Type] |
|  | Remote |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Impact Code execution] |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Impact Denial of Service] |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Vectors] |
|  | To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted CoAP packet to the server, causing the coap\_msg\_get\_payload(resp) function to return a null pointer. This null pointer is then passed to the memcpy function as the source argument, leading to undefined behavior and potential crashes. |
