The provided content relates to CVE-2024-40493.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `coap_client_exchange_blockwise2` function. The function `coap_msg_get_payload(resp)` can return a null pointer, which is then used as the source argument in a `memcpy` operation, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Potential for arbitrary code execution due to the undefined behavior of `memcpy` with a null source.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted CoAP packet to the server that causes the `coap_msg_get_payload(resp)` function to return a null pointer

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server.
