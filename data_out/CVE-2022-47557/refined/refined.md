Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-47557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort" (CWE-916). The device utilizes a weak password hashing mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Password Hashing:** The core issue is that the password hashes used by the device are easily cracked due to insufficient computational effort in their creation. This suggests the use of a weak hashing algorithm, inadequate salt, or insufficient iteration count.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Decryption:** An attacker with local network access can decrypt the credentials of privileged users.
*   **System Access:** Decrypted credentials allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Once inside, attackers can perform various malicious actions, including system manipulation, data theft or disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Presence:** The attacker must be positioned on the same network as the Ormazabal device to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs to be a low-privileged user.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The affected products are Ormazabal's ekorCCP and ekorRCI devices with firmware version 601j.
*   The severity score of this vulnerability is 6.1 (CVSS v3.1).
*   The vulnerability is part of a set of 10 vulnerabilities discovered in Ormazabal products
