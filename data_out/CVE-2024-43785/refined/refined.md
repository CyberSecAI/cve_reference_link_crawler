- Root cause of vulnerability: The `gix` and `ein` commands, which use `gitoxide-core`, do not neutralize special characters, including ANSI escape sequences, in pathnames and other metadata from a git repository.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper neutralization of special elements used in output (CWE-150). The application fails to sanitize or encode special characters, allowing them to be interpreted by the terminal.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can craft a malicious repository that, when accessed using the vulnerable tools, can misrepresent its contents, alter or concoct error messages, change colors, reposition the cursor, clear the terminal, or change the terminal title-bar.  The primary impact is misleading output to the user, although other, potentially more disruptive, terminal behaviors are possible.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is local, requiring the user to clone or interact with a malicious repository.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to create and distribute a specially crafted git repository. The user needs to interact with this repository using vulnerable versions of `gix` or `ein` tools. User interaction (running a gitoxide command) is required to trigger the vulnerability.
