Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a bug in the `graphql-go` library's handling of the `MaxDepth` schema option, specifically when processing fragment spreads. This bug allows crafted GraphQL queries to bypass the intended maximum depth check, leading to stack overflow panics due to excessive recursion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Depth Calculation:** The `MaxDepth` validation logic fails to properly track and prevent recursion through fragment spreads, particularly in cases involving circular dependencies between fragments.
- **Lack of Cycle Detection:** The original implementation lacked a mechanism to detect and prevent infinite loops caused by circular fragment references, leading to unbounded recursion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can send specially designed queries that exploit this vulnerability, causing stack overflow panics. This can lead to the server becoming unresponsive, disrupting its ability to serve data to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GraphQL Endpoint Access:** Attackers need access to the GraphQL endpoint to send the malicious queries. This could be an internal user or an external user if the endpoint is exposed.
- **Crafted Queries:** Attackers must craft specific GraphQL queries that contain circular fragment definitions or nested fragments designed to bypass the depth check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send GraphQL Queries:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests containing GraphQL queries to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of GraphQL and Fragments:** The attacker needs some understanding of GraphQL syntax, especially how fragment definitions and spreads work, to construct malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability only exists when the `graphql.MaxDepth` option is used in the GraphQL schema.
- The fix introduces a `visited` map to track visited fragment definitions during depth validation to prevent infinite loops in fragment processing.
- The fix also introduces new tests to confirm that the MaxDepth validation works correctly with fragment spreads.
- Disabling `graphql.MaxDepth` is a workaround, but it can open other potential attack vectors.

The commit `eae31ca` addresses the vulnerability by fixing the bug in fragment spread logic within the maxDepth validation, and includes added tests to ensure that the logic works as expected.
