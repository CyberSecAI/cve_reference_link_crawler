Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-26770:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-26770
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Improper Access Control
*   **Affected Version:** All versions prior to and including 0.3.2 of TaskCafe
*   **CWE:** CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
*   **Access Vector:** Remote
*   **Impact:** Escalation of privileges
*   **Security Risk:** High

**Root Cause:**

*   The TaskCafe application's password change functionality lacks sufficient authorization checks. It does not validate if the user submitting the request is authorized to change the password for the specified user ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The API doesn't verify if the user making the password change request is authorized to modify the specified user's password.
*   **Lack of Cookie Validation:**  The application requires an `authToken` cookie but does not validate its value. This allows an attacker to send a password change request with any `authToken`, bypassing a basic authorization control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker who obtains a user ID can change the password of the corresponding account and gain unauthorized access. This could lead to complete account takeover, including administrator accounts, if the attacker obtains the administrator's user ID.
*   An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain access to any user account on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over HTTP via the GraphQL API endpoint.
*   **User ID Acquisition:** The attacker needs a user ID to exploit this vulnerability. The user ID can be acquired by exploiting the Stored XSS vulnerability (CVE-2023-26771).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the TaskCafe server.
*   **User ID:** The attacker needs to know the user ID of the target account.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited by sending a modified password reset GraphQL request.
*   The attacker modifies the `userID` parameter in the request body to target the desired account.
*   The server accepts the request without checking the validity of the authToken or if the user is authorized to change the target user's password.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   Bishop Fox demonstrated the exploit by modifying a password reset request, changing the `userID` to that of another account, and successfully setting a new password.
