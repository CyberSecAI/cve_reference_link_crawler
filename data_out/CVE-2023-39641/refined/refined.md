Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `ids_affiliate` parameter in the `PsaffiliateGetaffiliatesdetailsModuleFrontController::initContent()` method of the "Full Affiliates" module for PrestaShop. This allows for SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module directly uses unsanitized user input (`ids_affiliate` parameter) within a SQL query.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Data breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Admin access:**  Exploitation could lead to gaining administrative privileges.
    *   **Data manipulation:** Attackers could remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
    *   **Account hijacking:** Attackers could obtain sensitive data to unlock admin ajax scripts and hijack emails.
    *   **Webskimmer deployment:** The exploit can be used to deploy webskimmers that steal credit card information.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **No privileges required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users (guests).
    *   **Low attack complexity:** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
    *   **No user interaction required**: The exploit can be triggered without user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `getaffiliatesdetails.php` controller file of the psaffiliate module.
*   The vulnerable code executes a SQL query using the `ids_affiliate` parameter without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to inject SQL code through the `ids_affiliate` parameter.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the `ids_affiliate` parameter by converting it into an array of integers before using it in the SQL query. This was achieved by using  `implode(',', array_map('intval', explode(',', Tools::getValue('ids_affiliate'))))`
