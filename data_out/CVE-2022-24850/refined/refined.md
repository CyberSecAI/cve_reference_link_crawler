- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in Discourse allowed category group permission settings to be viewed by any user with access to the category, even though this information should have been restricted to users with category management privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized users can view the group permissions settings of a category, revealing which groups have read/write permissions.
- **Attack vectors**: Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges are required. Any user with access to the category can view the group permissions settings. No user interaction is required.
