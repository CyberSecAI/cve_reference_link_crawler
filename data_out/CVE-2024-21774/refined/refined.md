Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-21774
* **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The Intel Processor Identification Utility software, before specific versions, does not properly control search paths. This allows an attacker to potentially influence the application's execution by manipulating the search path.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated local user to escalate their privileges.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access. An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine and be an authenticated user. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) and has a high attack complexity (AC:H)
