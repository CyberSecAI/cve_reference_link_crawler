Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw stemming from the use of `fmt.Sprintf` to construct a shell command in the `audioToWav` function. The function was using the `sh` function which used `exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", c)` to execute the command string. By directly interpolating user-supplied input (`src` and `dst` which represent file paths) into the command string, the application becomes susceptible to command injection. An attacker could insert malicious shell commands into the `src` or `dst` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Command Injection:** The code used `fmt.Sprintf` to build a command string with user-supplied input which allowed the user to inject malicious code.
- **Insecure command execution:** The code used `/bin/sh` with the `-c` argument to execute shell commands derived from user-supplied input. This is inherently dangerous.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands on the server by injecting malicious commands within `src` or `dst` arguments. This allows full compromise of the server including data exfiltration and denial of service, amongst other impacts.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by providing malicious input to the `src` or `dst` arguments within the `audioToWav` function. This function takes in file paths as input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `audioToWav` function. This likely involves interaction with an API or a user-interface that allows the user to specify source and destination file names.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is mitigated by switching the `sh` function to use `exec.Command` with an array of arguments instead of building the whole command as a string.  The `audioToWav` function was also modified to use the `runCommand` function instead of `sh` which now executes `ffmpeg` with an array of command arguments where arguments can no longer be interpreted as new commands.
