- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the absence of the `X-Frame-Options` server-side header in the Clibo Manager login panel at `/public/login`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Clickjacking vulnerability (CWE-1021) due to the missing `X-Frame-Options` header.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overlay a transparent iframe to perform click hijacking, potentially leading to unauthorized actions by a user who believes they are interacting with the legitimate application. The impact is assessed as having low confidentiality and integrity impact, and no impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An attacker would need to create a malicious webpage with an iframe overlaying the vulnerable login page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges, but must trick the user into visiting the attacker's malicious web page. User interaction is required to be exploited successfully.
