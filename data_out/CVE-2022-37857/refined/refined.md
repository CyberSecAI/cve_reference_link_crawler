Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-37857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Hauk application v1.6.1 requires a hardcoded password, which by default is blank. This password, even when hashed, is stored in the `config.php` file server-side and in clear text on the Android client device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The application uses a hardcoded password, which is a major security flaw. This allows anyone who has access to the configuration file or the client device to potentially gain unauthorized access.
*   **Weak Password Policy:**  The application does not enforce a strong password policy, allowing users to potentially use weak or easily guessable passwords which exacerbates the hardcoded default password issue.
*  **Cleartext Storage on Client**: The default password is also stored in cleartext on the client device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application and server due to the hardcoded and weak password.
*   **Data Breach/Compromise:** Once access is gained, attackers may access or modify sensitive information, such as location data, user information, or other resources.
* **Compromise of server side application**: Since the hardcoded password is used for authentication, an attacker could potentially gain control of the application server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Configuration File:** An attacker who gains access to the `config.php` file on the server can obtain the hashed (but easily cracked) password.
*   **Access to Client Device:** An attacker with access to the android client device can find the password in cleartext.
*   **Network Sniffing:** If communication between the app and server is not encrypted, it might be possible to intercept the credentials in transit
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker could trick a user into revealing their password or server configuration details.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Server:** The attacker needs some level of access to the server hosting the Hauk application, either directly or indirectly (such as via compromised account/machine) to get to the `config.php` file.
*   **Access to the Client Device:** The attacker needs access to the client device to find the cleartext default password
*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to interact with the affected application via the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported by J-GainSec on GitHub issues.
*   The developer's decision was to leave the password requirements to the administrator.
*   The vulnerability is present in Hauk version 1.6.1
* The CVE description is more detailed than the initial github issue description and includes the root cause of the issue as hardcoded credentials in config.php and in cleartext in the client and also mentions the weak default password, not just the "weak password policy".
