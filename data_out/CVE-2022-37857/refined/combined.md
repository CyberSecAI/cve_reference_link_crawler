| Hope you're well!  I spent a tiny bit of time so far doing some testing of your app and I'm impressed!  Just have two small issues to tell you about!   1. Consider making the Password and Encryption password policies up to par for best practices. This would be minimum 12 (8 if you REALLY want) including upper/lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.   More info: <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html>   2. The APK is signed with the v1 scheme. Since this is the case, the APK is vulnerable to the Janus Vulnerability. What that means is an attacker can add extra bytes to an APK and DEX file. Although this would require an attacker to trick a target into downloaded the modified and malicious app just figured I'd let you know!   More info: <https://medium.com/mobis3c/exploiting-apps-vulnerable-to-janus-cve-2017-13156-8d52c983b4e0> AND <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-13156>  I'll let you know if anything else comes up! |

| 1. isn't this an admin responsibility? ref: <https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/blob/master/backend-php/include/config-sample.php#L73> 2. An app update might bump it to v2, also <https://f-droid.org/2017/12/13/fdroid-and-janus.html> |

| 1. You can leave it up to the admin but it's considered part of the [Identification and Authentication Failures](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1353.html) OWASP Top 10 categories. Specifically  [CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html). 2. Interesting, f-droid didn't by default bump it to v2 a few days ago but I grabbed it. But shifting the risk to F-Droid I understand |

| It's not my/f-droid's thing, the dev here decides when/if they publish a new version.  Are we lost in translation? |

# CVE-2022-37857, CVE-2022-37163, CVE-2022-37164 Hardcoded Credentials/Weak Password Policies

[gainsec](https://gainsec.com/author/gainsec/ "Posts by gainsec")
[Android Hacking](https://gainsec.com/category/android-hacking/), [CVE](https://gainsec.com/category/cve/), [Hacking Android](https://gainsec.com/category/hacking-android/), [Mobile Penetration Testing](https://gainsec.com/category/penetration-testing/mobile-penetration-testing/), [Pentesting Android](https://gainsec.com/category/pentesting-android/)
August 7, 2022August 26, 2022

* [CVE-2022-37857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37857)
* Affected product and version: Hauk version 1.6.1
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and hardcoded credentials
* Description: Hauk v1.6.1 requires a hardcoded password which by default is blank. This hardcoded password is hashed but stored within the config.php file server-side as well as in clear-text on the android client device by default.

* [CVE-2022-37163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37163)
* Affected Product and version: IHateToBudget version 1.5.7
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
* Description: IHateToBudget v1.5.7 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.

* [CVE-2022-37164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37164)
* Affected product and version: OnTrack version 3.4
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
* Description: OnTrack v3.4 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.

So I ran into an interesting issue with a self-hosted location sharing service that includes a android client available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.varden.hauk/) and the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.varden.hauk&hl=en&gl=US).

I reached out to the developer talking about the Janus vulnerability although I think that his response was totally legitimate. Which you can read about [HERE](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/issues/187).

If you’re interested in the Janus vulnerability, check more information about it [HERE](https://medium.com/mobis3c/exploiting-apps-vulnerable-to-janus-cve-2017-13156-8d52c983b4e0)!

Regardless what I decided to pursue and report was the fact that credentials are hardcoded [HERE](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/blob/master/backend-php/include/config-sample.php#L73), although of course you need to replace config-sample.php to config.php.

So the developer was professional and didn’t have real push back but their choice was to leave the password requirements/hardcoded credential requirement to the administrator.

Even though I completely understand it, I wanted to let those that rely on this server/client know.

That is where [CVE-2022-37857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37857) comes from!

Following that path, the OnTrack application found [HERE](https://github.com/inoda/ontrack) was also vulnerable and assigned [CVE-2022-37164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37164)

Lastly the same issue was found in the [IHateToBudget](https://github.com/bminusl/ihatetobudget) application found HERE and was assigned [CVE-2022-37163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37163)

Hope its helpful!
