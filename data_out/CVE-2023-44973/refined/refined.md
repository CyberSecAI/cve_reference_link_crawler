The provided content describes a vulnerability in Emlog Pro version 2.2.0, which allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution by uploading a malicious template.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when uploading and extracting template files in the backend of Emlog Pro. Specifically, the system allows uploading of a ZIP archive containing a PHP file, which is then extracted to a publicly accessible directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows uploading ZIP files without proper validation.
- Path traversal: The system extracts files from the archive without properly sanitizing file names, allowing an attacker to potentially control where files are extracted.
- Remote code execution: Uploaded and extracted PHP files can be accessed and executed by a user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution on the server. An attacker can execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining full control of the server and data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the backend interface of Emlog Pro. An attacker needs to access the backend where they can upload a new template.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Emlog Pro backend.
- The attacker needs to create a malicious ZIP archive containing a PHP file.
