Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Open redirect on the login page.

**Root Cause:** The login page accepted a `redirect-to` argument which, prior to the fix, allowed redirects to arbitrary external URLs.

**Weakness:**
- Improper input validation and sanitization of the `redirect-to` parameter.
- Lack of domain validation for the redirect URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability by crafting login URLs that redirect users to a fake login page, tricking them into entering their credentials on a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted login link with a malicious URL as the `redirect-to` parameter to a user.
- Social engineering to trick users into clicking on the malicious link.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be external (remote), as the vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to click on a malicious link.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability existed in the `frappe/www/login.py` file.
- The fix introduces the function `sanitize_redirect` to validate the redirect URL, allowing redirects only to the same domain or to relative paths.
- The fix also includes a test case in `frappe/tests/test_api.py` to verify the redirect behavior.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.1.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-601.
