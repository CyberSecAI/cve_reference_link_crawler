## FAQ

### Where can I find Master Slider documentation and user guides

If you have any question about working with “Master Slider”, you can take a look at [online documentations](http://docs.averta.net/display/MSWPF/)

### When I preview the slider in admin page everything looks fine, but when I add it to my website the slider looks different. How can I fix that?

It is a known issue with few poor coded themes that can be easily fixed. In fact, some styles in your theme conflicts with the styles in Master Slider. You can simply submit a ticket in support section, our support agents will advice you how to fix the conflicts.

### Will Master Slider work with my theme?

Master Slider works with any theme, including the default WordPress themes.

### Can you recommend a free theme that is optimized for Master Slider

Fortunately there are plenty of options out there, including the default WordPress themes too. But the one that we recommend most is [Phlox theme](http://avt.li/msphpp "Phlox theme - Free Minimal and Responsive WordPress Theme") which is a free, versatile and optimized theme for Master Slider.

### I added text to slide (slide info), but it does not appear in slider

You need to add “slide info” control too. To do that, go for editing slider, under “slider controls” tab, select and add “slide info” control

### After I’ve removed a slider, it still appears on my website

Maybe you have a cache plugin enabled on your website or Master Slider’s built-in cache is enabled.

### Where can I report bugs?

Bugs can be reported in our [support forums](https://wordpress.org/tags/master-slider).

November 13, 2024

Since June 2024 the PlugIn is suffering from severe security issues. It is highly recommended to deinstall the PlugIn – certainly since the developer seems to have no interest to take care of the problem.For more information search google for “Wordfence Master Slider”

Our business used this on our site for a few years, and it worked very well for what we needed it for. We switched to new parent/child themes that have sliders built in that have made this plugin obsolete for us, but when we used it, it worked great.
My only issue is that, nearly a year after uninstalling this plugin, I checked my wp\_options table for a cleanup and found so many gigantic remnants of this slider in there. Even the “transient” ones were still in there after a year. Deleting them out of my options table sped up my site significantly. Hopefully the newer iterations of this plugin have resolved both the issue of slowdown as well as the absolute horde of zombie autoload options.
