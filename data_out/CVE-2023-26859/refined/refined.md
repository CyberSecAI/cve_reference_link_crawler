- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sendinblue` module for PrestaShop, specifically in the `ajaxOrderTracking.php` file, fails to properly sanitize the `id_shop_group` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This occurs when the double opt-in option is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89). The module uses a sensitive SQL call that can be exploited with a simple HTTP request.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the PrestaShop installation.
    - Copy sensitive data to the front end, potentially exposing tokens and unlocking admin Ajax scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability through HTTP GET or POST requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction is required, making it easy for an unauthenticated attacker to exploit. The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
