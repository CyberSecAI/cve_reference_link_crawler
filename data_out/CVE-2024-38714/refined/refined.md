Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WP Fast Total Search plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is a failure to properly validate user privileges before allowing certain actions, resulting in unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is described as low severity and unlikely to be exploited. However, the description mentions that an unprivileged user could execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact would vary depending on the exact function being accessed without authorization.

**Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to identify the vulnerable function lacking proper access control and then craft a request to exploit the weakness.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a user with 'Subscriber' privilege or lower to exploit this vulnerability. They do not need admin privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
