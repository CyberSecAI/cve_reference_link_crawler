- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect access control in the `employeeadd.php` file within the Admin Panel of the SourceCodester Human Resource Management System version 1.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system does not properly restrict access to the resource (`employeeadd.php`), allowing unauthorized actors to interact with it. This is a classic access control vulnerability categorized under CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. An attacker could potentially manipulate input to the vulnerable script to gain unauthorized access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `employeeadd.php` file which is reachable via the web and does not require any authentication.
