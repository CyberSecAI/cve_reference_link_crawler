# Path traversal through symlinks for @backstage/backend-common

High

[benjdlambert](/benjdlambert)
published
GHSA-2fc9-xpp8-2g9h
Feb 23, 2024

## Package

npm

@backstage/backend-common
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

= 0.21.0
< 0.19.10
>= 0.20.0, < 0.20.2

## Patched versions

0.21.1
0.19.10
0.20.2

## Description

### Impact

Paths checks with the `resolveSafeChildPath` utility were not exhaustive enough, leading to risk of path traversal vulnerabilities if symlinks can be injected by attackers.

### Patches

Patched in `@backstage/backend-common` version `0.21.1`.

Patched in `@backstage/backend-common` version `0.20.2`.

Patched in `@backstage/backend-common` version `0.19.10`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID
