The wycheproof GCM test in question:

```
{
  "tcId" : 16,
  "comment" : "Flipped bit 0 in tag",
  "key" : "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f",
  "iv" : "505152535455565758595a5b",
  "aad" : "",
  "msg" : "202122232425262728292a2b2c2d2e2f",
  "ct" : "eb156d081ed6b6b55f4612f021d87b39",
  "tag" : "d9847dbc326a06e988c77ad3863e6083",
  "result" : "invalid",
  "flags" : []
},

```

The trouble is that we do not reject invalid tag `d9847dbc326a06e988c77ad3863e6083`, corresponding valid tag has the first byte `d8`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@sjaeckel](https://github.com/sjaeckel) a question for you (pls answer without looking into doc and/or code)  Let us have the following code:  ```       err = gcm_memory(idx, key, sizeof(key), iv, sizeof(iv), NULL, 0,                        pt, sizeof(ct), ct, tag, &taglen, GCM_DECRYPT); ```  Do you expect that the caller should fill the tag + taglen before calling `gcm_memory` (which will handle the tag validation and return CRYPT\_OK only if the tag is correct) OR do you expect that `gcm_memory` will only calculate the tag and store it into tag + taglen (so that the tag validation is caller's job)? |

| ah the good ol' `gcm_memory()` API  TBH I've no clue, I'd have to have a look in the code or docs... Btw. there's still [#307](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt/issues/307) ;) |

| Yes, it is a mess. And BTW I have a security hole in my perl bindings [DCIT/perl-CryptX#47](https://github.com/DCIT/perl-CryptX/issues/47) as I was expecting that it validates the tag (which it doesn't).  What is the proper fix?  I tend to like more two separate functions: `gcm_decrypt_verify_memory` + `gcm_encrypt_authenticate_memory` as we have with EAX and completely DEPRECATE `gcm_memory` |

| BTW the doc for `gcm_memory` does not help at all.  A possible "fix" may be just updating doc and declare the current behaviour, IMO slightly unexpected, as a feature. Or can we afford an API breakage here? |

Otherwise I'd be fine with two separate functions, but should we then change that in CCM as well?! |

| I have the code aligning `gcm_memory` and `chacha20poly1305_memory` to the `ccm_memory` behaviour (== adding tag validation to decrypt mode) nearly ready. I'll finish it & push it and after that we can decide what next. |
