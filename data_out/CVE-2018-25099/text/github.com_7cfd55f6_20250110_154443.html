| I can pass anything as the tag into gcm\_decrypt\_verify() and it will return decrypted plaintext. It looks like this might have been lost with the conversion to XS in recent versions.  ``` #!/usr/bin/env perl use 5.14.0; use strictures 2;  use Crypt::AuthEnc::GCM qw(gcm_decrypt_verify gcm_encrypt_authenticate); use MIME::Base64 qw(decode_base64);  my ($ct, $tag) = gcm_encrypt_authenticate(   'AES',   decode_base64('QG1vT29ke5maBZRtdqaEcC8BjDxPGOILyylheMSkyM4='),   decode_base64('tWWWVmRvthlL0d6iFNJtHOIWkFSpf7p7hCoE+l+Pszo='),   undef,   'Hello Crypto', );  # this should not work because I am not providing the correct tag value my $pt = gcm_decrypt_verify(   'AES',   decode_base64('QG1vT29ke5maBZRtdqaEcC8BjDxPGOILyylheMSkyM4='),   decode_base64('tWWWVmRvthlL0d6iFNJtHOIWkFSpf7p7hCoE+l+Pszo='),   undef,   $ct,   "anything", );  say $pt;  ``` |

| Unfortunately the same bug in `chacha20poly1305_decrypt_verify`.  Should be fixed in CryptX-0.061\_002 |
