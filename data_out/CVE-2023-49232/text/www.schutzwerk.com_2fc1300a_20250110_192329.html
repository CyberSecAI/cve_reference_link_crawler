Text-only version:
https://www.schutzwerk.com/advisories/SCHUTZWERK-SA-2023-004.txt
Affected products/vendor
========================
All versions prior to Visual Planning 8 (Build 240207) by STILOG I.S.T.
Summary
=======
Unauthenticated attackers can exploit a weakness in the password reset functionality of the Visual Planning[0] application in order to obtain access to arbitrary user accounts including administrators. In case administrative (in the context of Visual Planning) accounts are compromised, attackers can install malicious modules into the application to take over the application server hosting the Visual Planning application.
Risk
====
The application does not impose any limits on the number of guesses that can be made. Attackers can therefore initiate the reset for arbitrary users and automate the pin validation process until a valid pin is obtained. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to gain access to arbitrary user accounts including administrators.
Failed pin validation attempts are not logged by the application which greatly increases the difficulty of detecting ongoing attacks.
With administrative access to Admin Center, attackers can install malicious modules containing Java code that is executed on the application server, resulting in arbitrary command execution.
The entire pin space can be enumerated in approximately one to two hours.
Description
===========
During a recent red teaming assessment, Visual Planning was identified as part of the customers internet-facing assets. The software is developed by STILOG I.S.T. and provides resource management and scheduling features. A security assessment conducted by SCHUTZWERK found an authentication bypass in Visual Planning's password reset functionality.
The application Admin Center (vpadmin) communicates with the server through an XML-based protocol that utilizes proprietary compression methods and is transmitted via HTTP. SCHUTZWERK implemented a custom proxy as part of an assessment in order to intercept and manipulate the messages exchanged between application and server.
One of the first messages sent by the Admin Center application after launch is the following:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
canResetPassword
false

In this request, the client asks the server whether it should display the "Forgot your password ?" button as part of the login form. During the assessment, the server responded as follows:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
resetPassword
false

OK

By altering the value to "true", the password reset functionality becomes accessible in the application. At this point, attackers can provide the target username. This causes a request similar to the following to be issued:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
sendResetPasswwd
false

login
admin

While handling this request, the server generates a five digit numeric pin and tries to send it to the email address associated with the provided username. Regardless of whether the email could be successfully transmitted, the generated pin is stored in a attribute of the session used while performing the reset. It should be noted that the password reset request message can be sent directly without enabling the button in the GUI if the message format is already known.
To complete the reset process, the correct pin (matching the pin stored in the session attribute) must be specified. A message similar to the following is issued by the application to validiate the provided pin:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
validateResetPasswwd
false

login
admin

userCode
58344

When an invalid pin is provided, the server responds with the following XML document:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
ERROR
Invalid code.

KO

In case the pin is valid, the server responds with a VPUser data structure similar to the following:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
vpUser
1
C442-53EB-B185-8804-F6BF-70AC-61C3-31BC
true
Super administrateur
yahd6Coo@schutzwerk.com
false

-1

0

admin
0

VP
true
false

OK

In addition, an empty password is set for the target username. Upon first login after reset, a new password must be set for this user.
