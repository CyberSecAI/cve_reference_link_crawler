Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45344:

**Summary:**

This CVE relates to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability found in the Online Food Ordering System v1.0. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `routers/user-router.php` file.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing parameters related to wallet balances. Specifically, the code uses a regular expression `/[0-9]+_balance/` to identify parameters intended to update wallet balances. However, it then extracts the numeric key using `strtok` and directly injects the user-supplied value into an SQL query without any sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization, leading to SQL injection.  The application assumes that the received `value` for the balance is safe without verifying its content.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete database compromise. An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data, including customer details, financial information, and administrative credentials. They can also potentially gain control of the underlying system by injecting malicious SQL.
*  **Attack Vector:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `*\_balance` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability; they only need network access to the application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is present within the `routers/user-router.php` file and can be triggered by sending a POST request with a malicious `*\_balance` parameter.

```php
if(preg_match("/[0-9]+_balance/",$key)){
 $key = strtok($key, '_');
 $result = mysqli_query($con,"SELECT * from wallet WHERE customer_id = $key;");
 if($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)){
 $wallet_id = $row['id'];
 $sql = "UPDATE wallet_details SET balance = '$value' WHERE wallet_id = $wallet_id;";
 $con->query($sql);
    }
}
```

This code iterates through the POST parameters, and if it finds a key matching the `/[0-9]+_balance/` regex, it extracts the numeric portion before `_balance`, performs a SELECT query to find the wallet and updates wallet_details table using the user-provided value. The `$value` is directly placed into the SQL query without any sanitization, leading to the injection.
