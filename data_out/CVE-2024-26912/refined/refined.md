The provided content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Nouveau driver, responsible for managing GSP-RM DMA buffers, was not deallocating several of these buffers. Some buffers could be deallocated after GSP-RM initialization but the rest needed to remain until the driver unloaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DMA Buffer Leaks:** Several DMA buffers were not being deallocated, leading to memory leaks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Uncontrolled memory consumption.
- Potential system instability due to memory exhaustion.
- The impact is described as a memory leak, not directly causing a crash. However, exhausting the memory can indirectly lead to a system crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Nouveau driver's handling of GSP-RM DMA buffers. This is triggered by using the affected driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to utilize a system with a vulnerable Nouveau driver, triggering the allocation and leakage of the DMA buffers.
- The attacker doesn't need any special capabilities other than having the vulnerable driver loaded/used.

**Additional details:**
- The fix introduces a `nvkm_gsp_mem_dtor` function to properly deallocate the DMA buffers and clears the `nvkm_gsp_mem` object.
- The fix also poisons the buffers before deallocation by filling it with `0xFF`. If GSP-RM accesses freed buffer, it should trigger an error or crash due to poisoned memory. This helps to ensure that any premature deallocation can be caught.
- The type of `mem->size` was changed from `u32` to `size_t` to match the type expected by the `dma_alloc_coherent` function.
