- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect handling of a specific type of malformed UDP packet within the UDP packet validation code of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leading to a buffer overflow (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to cause the device to reboot, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An adjacent attacker in a machine-in-the-middle position sends crafted UDP packets to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the vulnerable device and be able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to send malformed UDP packets. The attacker does not need authentication.
