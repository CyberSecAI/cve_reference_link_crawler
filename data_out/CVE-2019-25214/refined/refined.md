Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `ShopWP` plugin had missing authorization checks on several REST API routes. This allowed unauthenticated users to access and interact with these routes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper authentication checks on the plugin's REST API endpoints.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts through the plugin's settings, leading to stored XSS when other users interact with the affected functionality

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers could perform unauthorized actions on the WordPress site, including:
    *   Updating plugin settings.
    *   Injecting malicious JavaScript code (XSS).
*   **Security Breach:** The ability to inject malicious code could lead to various security issues, such as user session hijacking, data theft, and redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API Routes:** Attackers directly interacted with the vulnerable REST API routes.
*   **Unauthenticated Requests:** The vulnerability did not require the attacker to have any valid authentication credentials

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker did not need any specific user privileges or be logged into the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needed to send requests to the vulnerable REST API routes over the network.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content highlights a security patch in version 2.0.5 that addresses a "Major XSS security vulnerability" and includes other fixes, like adding proper permission callbacks to REST API endpoints. This implies a direct connection to CVE-2019-25214.
* The plugin's Trac changeset logs show the addition of permission callbacks to REST API endpoints, addressing the authorization issue, and removing the XSS vulnerability.
*   The Wordfence analysis also confirms the missing authorization checks and the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.
*   The patch notes also mention a fix related to a "Shopify security vulnerability", which could be indirectly related by the plugin acting as an interface to Shopify.
