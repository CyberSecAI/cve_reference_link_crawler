The WooCommerce UPS Shipping â€“ Live Rates and Access Points plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the delete_oauth_data function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete the plugin's API key.
