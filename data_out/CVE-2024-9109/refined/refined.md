Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9109

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `delete_oauth_data` function of the "UPS Live Rates and Access Points" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Missing Authorization:** The `delete_oauth_data` function, which is responsible for deleting the plugin's API key, lacks a proper capability check. This allows users with insufficient privileges to trigger the function.
* **Insecure Direct Object Reference:**  The lack of proper access control on the `delete_oauth_data` function makes it possible for lower-privileged users to directly access and modify sensitive data (the API key).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **API Key Deletion:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to delete the plugin's API key, disrupting the plugin's functionality and potentially impacting shipping calculations.
* **Denial of Service (Partial):** By deleting the API key, the attacker can effectively disable the plugin, leading to a denial of service condition related to UPS shipping functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:**  The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
* **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the plugin's AJAX endpoint, which is accessible through the WordPress web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user.
* **Subscriber Role or Higher:** The attacker needs to have at least the Subscriber role. Users with this role or any higher role such as Contributor, Author, Editor or Administrator are able to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `flexible-shipping-ups/vendor_prefixed/octolize/wp-ups-oauth/src/OAuth/Ajax.php` file.
*   The fix was implemented by adding a capability check `current_user_can('manage_woocommerce')` to the `delete_oauth_data` function, ensuring only users with the 'manage_woocommerce' capability can execute it.
*   The vulnerable versions are up to and including 2.3.12.
*   The patched version is 3.0.0.
*   The vulnerability is considered a medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
