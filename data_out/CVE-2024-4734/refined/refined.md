**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Import and export users and customers plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker with administrator-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts via the plugin's admin settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level permissions or higher.
- The attack only works in multi-site installations or installations where `unfiltered_html` has been disabled.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the email subject and user meta values.
- The vulnerable code was in `classes/email-options.php` and `classes/meta-keys.php` where user input was not properly sanitized or escaped before being output to the page. Specifically, `esc_html()` was added to sanitize the email subject and `htmlspecialchars()` was added to sanitize the meta value.
- The vulnerable versions include all versions up to and including 1.26.6.1, and the patched version is 1.26.7.
