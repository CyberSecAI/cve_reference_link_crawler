{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when adding new phonebook entries, allowing for HTML injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "HTML Injection, specifically in the 'name' and 'email' fields of the phonebook feature.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious HTML code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they view the phonebook, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
   "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically the phonebook functionality. An attacker needs to be an authenticated user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to access the application and the 'My Account > Phonebook' section. They need the ability to add or modify phonebook entries."
