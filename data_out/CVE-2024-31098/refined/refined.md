Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability**: The New Order Notification for Woocommerce plugin (versions <= 2.0.2) suffers from a broken access control vulnerability. This is due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, which allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control
* **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (specifically a subscriber, according to the details) can perform actions that should be restricted, potentially leading to unintended consequences. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
* **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a function within the plugin that lacks proper access controls. The exact method of exploitation isn't detailed but involves a request being made to the vulnerable function.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with the "Subscriber" role is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability. This implies that any logged-in user, regardless of their level, can exploit this vulnerability.
