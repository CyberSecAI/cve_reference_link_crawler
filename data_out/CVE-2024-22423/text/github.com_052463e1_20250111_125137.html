# `--exec` command injection when using `%q` in yt-dlp on Windows

High

[coletdjnz](/coletdjnz)
published
GHSA-42h4-v29r-42qg
Sep 24, 2023

## Package

pip

yt-dlp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 2021.04.11, < 2023.09.24, < nightly 2023.09.24.003044

## Patched versions

2023.09.24, nightly 2023.09.24.003044

## Description

### Impact

[`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) allows the user to provide shell commands to be executed at various stages in its download process through the `--exec` flag. This flag allows output template expansion in its argument, so that video metadata values may be used in the shell commands. The metadata fields can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended to quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell.

However, the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows) did not properly escape special characters, which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec` is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`.

Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version [2021.04.11](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2021.04.11).

### Patches

yt-dlp version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special character.

`\n` will be replaced by `\r`, as no way of escaping it has been found.

### Workarounds

It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using `--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous.

For Windows users who are not able to upgrade:

* Avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath).
* If expansion in `--exec` is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `"`, `|` or `&`.
* Instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
