- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in IntelÂ® Distribution for GDB software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly validate input, leading to a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can potentially cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. The user interaction is required for successful exploitation.
