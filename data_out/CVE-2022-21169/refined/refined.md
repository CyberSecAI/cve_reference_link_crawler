Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to Prototype Pollution in the `express-xss-sanitizer` package. Specifically, the `allowedTags` option of the sanitizer could be manipulated by polluting the `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The application uses a vulnerable way of handling options, which allows an attacker to modify the `Object.prototype`. By setting `Object.prototype.allowedTags`, an attacker can inject allowed tags into the sanitization process.
*   **Bypass of XSS Sanitization:** By polluting the prototype, the attacker can inject a malicious payload, such as `<script>alert()</script>`, which should have been sanitized by the middleware, but is now allowed because the prototype modification has effectively changed the sanitization rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** While not directly stated, the vulnerability could potentially lead to remote code execution if the application evaluates a polluted property.
*   **Denial of Service:** Prototype pollution can lead to denial of service due to unexpected behavior of the application.
*   **Property Injection:** The attacker could inject properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value or security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the client-side JavaScript environment, polluting the `Object.prototype` before the sanitization middleware is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Client-Side Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the client side of the application. This could be through another XSS vulnerability or a compromised client.
*   **Knowledge of Prototype Pollution:** The attacker needs to understand how prototype pollution works in JavaScript and how to leverage it to bypass the XSS sanitization.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `express-xss-sanitizer` versions prior to 1.1.3.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is available, demonstrating the bypass by polluting `Object.prototype.allowedTags`.
*   The fix involves preventing prototype pollution and ensuring that sanitization rules cannot be manipulated.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.3 (High) according to Snyk.
