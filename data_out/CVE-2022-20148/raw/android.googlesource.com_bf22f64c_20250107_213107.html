            f2fs: allow to change discard policy based on cached discard cmdsWith the default DPOLICY_BG discard thread is ioaware, which preventsthe discard thread from issuing the discard commands. On low RAM setups,it is observed that these discard commands in the cache are consuminghigh memory.
