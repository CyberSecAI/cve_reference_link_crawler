- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improperly Preserved Integrity of Hardware Configuration State During a Power Save/Restore Operation (CWE-1304)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Gallagher Controller 6000 and Controller 7000, when connected to Aperio Communication Hubs, may fail to properly maintain the state of door locks during power save/restore operations. This leads to a brief period where doors are unlocked.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation allows secured door locks connected through Aperio hubs to momentarily allow free access.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to a device that experiences a power save/restore operation
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to cause a power save/restore operation on a Gallagher controller connected to Aperio Communication Hubs.
