The provided content describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in the KnowStreaming application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that unauthorized users can access user role information and create new users, including those with administrator privileges. This indicates a lack of proper authentication and authorization checks on the API endpoints for fetching user role information and creating new users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The application does not properly authenticate requests to retrieve user role information or to create new user accounts.
*   **Missing Authorization:** The application does not properly authorize requests to retrieve user role information or to create new user accounts.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** An attacker can directly request the role ID of the "admin" user, potentially by brute-forcing if the user ID is not 1.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
*   Create a new user with administrator privileges.
*   Gain complete control of the application.
*   Potentially access sensitive data and perform malicious actions within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending unauthorized HTTP requests to the application's API endpoints.
*   One endpoint is used to retrieve role IDs, and another is for creating new users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker only needs to have network access to the application server to send the crafted requests.
*   The attacker must be able to enumerate the admin role id (either by knowing it or guessing it)
