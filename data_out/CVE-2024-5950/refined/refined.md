- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when handling multipart form variables.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
