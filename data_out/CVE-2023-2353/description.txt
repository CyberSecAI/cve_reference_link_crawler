The CHP Ads Block Detector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin settings update and reset due to a missing capability check on the chp_abd_action function in versions up to, and including, 3.9.4. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to change or reset plugin settings. CVE-2023-36509 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.
