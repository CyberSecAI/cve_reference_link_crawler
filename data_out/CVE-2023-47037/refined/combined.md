| It would be nice to have a base airflow form Class so we could modify `Form.populate_obj` there and not for every form that has a `ReadOnly` field, but I'm not sure the change it's worth it given only 2 forms use this. |

Subject: CVE-2023-47037: Apache Airflow missing fix for CVE-2023-40611 in
 2.7.1 (DAG run broken access)

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.7.3

Description:

We failed to apply¬†CVE-2023-40611 in 2.7.1 and this vulnerability was marked as fixed then.

Apache Airflow, versions before 2.7.3, is affected by a vulnerability that allows authenticated and DAG-view authorized Users to modify some DAG run detail values when submitting notes. This could have them alter details such as configuration parameters, start date, etc.

Users should upgrade to version 2.7.3 or later which has removed the vulnerability.
