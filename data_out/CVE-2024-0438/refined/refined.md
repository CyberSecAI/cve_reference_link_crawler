Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `wrapper-link.php` file of the Happy Addons for Elementor plugin. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input for the "wrapper link" parameter within the Age Gate feature and doesn't escape output. This lack of input sanitization and output escaping allows the injection of malicious scripts into the website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly cleanse the "wrapper link" parameter, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to be included.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:**  The plugin does not encode the output when rendering the "wrapper link", leading to the execution of injected scripts in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that executes whenever a user views a page where the vulnerable "wrapper link" is present.
- **Compromised User Accounts:**  Attackers can potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface pages, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Website Defacement/Malware Distribution**: The injected script can modify the content of the page or redirect to malicious resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the "wrapper link" parameter.
- This crafted link is saved through the vulnerable plugin.
- When a user views a page containing the affected element, the injected script executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in to WordPress with at least a 'contributor' role.
- **Access to Elementor:** They need the ability to edit pages or posts using the Elementor page builder.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs awareness of the vulnerable plugin and its affected settings.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the Happy Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including 3.10.1.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.10.2.
- CVE-2024-29108 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
- The vulnerable code can be seen within the `extensions/wrapper-link.php` file, specifically how the `ha_element_link` is handled.
- The javascript file `happy-addons.js`  also shows how the `data-ha-element-link` is used to create a link on the page.

This information is more detailed than the basic CVE description would provide, offering a clearer picture of the vulnerability's nature and exploitation method.
