Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-37035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) condition caused by a race condition in the `bgpd` daemon of FRRouting (FRR).
- The race occurs between two threads: an I/O thread and the main thread processing BGP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core issue is that the main thread might attempt to access or free a memory location that has already been freed by the I/O thread.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper synchronization between the I/O thread which reads data into `peer->ibuf` and then `peer->curr` and the main thread which uses the `peer->curr` pointer. The main thread reads the pointer and proceeds without holding a lock, and the I/O thread might free the underlying memory while the main thread is using the pointer, leading to UAF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information in memory.
- **bgpd crash:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the bgpd daemon.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted BGP packets to a vulnerable FRR router.
- **Specifically crafted BGP messages:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a sequence of BGP OPEN, KEEPALIVE, and NOTIFICATION messages. The provided test scripts send a BGP OPEN, followed by a KEEPALIVE and then a NOTIFICATION message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the targeted FRR router.
- **BGP knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the BGP protocol to craft malicious packets.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was found using address sanitizer during fuzzing with Boofuzz, as noted in the provided discussion.
- The issue was fixed in FRR by synchronizing the access to the shared data by extending the mutex to include usage, and freeing operations.
- The Debian LTS advisory lists CVE-2022-37035 as one of several vulnerabilities fixed in the `frr` package, further confirming the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be triggered with a high probability, but not 100% of the time, suggesting it is a race condition.
- The provided information indicates that the `extended-optional-parameters` configuration is not required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The discussion highlights the specific locations in the code related to the vulnerability: `bgp_packet.c:2886` and `bgp_packet.c:922`.
- A patch was merged to resolve this vulnerability
