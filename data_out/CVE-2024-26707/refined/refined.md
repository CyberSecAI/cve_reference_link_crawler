{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The kernel's High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) and Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) networking drivers use WARN_ONCE() when failing to allocate resources for sending supervision frames, which is not helpful and can be triggered repeatedly by Syzkaller.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate error reporting mechanism.",
       "Use of WARN_ONCE() in a frequently occurring error condition."
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is the generation of excessive warning messages that clutter logs, which can obscure more important issues. It also impacts automated testing systems like Syzkaller by generating false positives.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by any condition that prevents the successful allocation of resources needed to send the HSR/PRP supervision frames. This is most commonly due to resource exhaustion.",
      "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are required, the issue arises from normal system operation."
  },
  "resolution": "The fix replaces WARN_ONCE() with netdev_warn_once() in the send_hsr_supervision_frame() and send_prp_supervision_frame() functions. This change will limit the number of times the warning is emitted per device, suppressing the repetitive warnings reported by Syzkaller and other similar occurrences."
