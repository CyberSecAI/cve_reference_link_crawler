The Tutor LMS – Migration Tool plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the tutor\_import\_from\_xml function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to import courses.
