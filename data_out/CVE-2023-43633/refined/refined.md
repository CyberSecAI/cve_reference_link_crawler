Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-43633:

**Root Cause:**

- The EVE OS, during boot, reads configuration settings from `/config/GlobalConfig/global.json`. If this file exists, the system overrides its existing configuration with the settings found within.
- The `/config` partition, where this file resides, is neither protected by "measured boot" nor encrypted. This makes it mutable and freely accessible to an attacker.
- Specifically, this issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the config measurement was moved to PCR14 but it was not included in the measured boot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information:** The configuration file containing debug settings and other sensitive information is stored in an unprotected partition.
- **Insufficient Protection of Credentials:** Sensitive debug configurations, like those enabling SSH with custom authorized keys, are easily modifiable.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The lack of protection for the configuration file allows an attacker to enable debug features, effectively bypassing normal authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full Device Control:** An attacker can gain complete control over the affected device by modifying the configuration file.
- **Unlocking Debug Features:** Attackers can enable debug functions such as SSH access, USB keyboard access, and VNC access.
- **Access to the vault:** Attackers can gain full access to the vault.
- **No Detection:** Since the `/config` partition is not measured, the "measured boot" mechanism is not triggered, and the device is not flagged as tampered.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the device can modify the `/config/GlobalConfig/global.json` file.
- **Possibly compromised update:** A malicious update could also modify the file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have physical access to the device's storage or the ability to modify files in the /config directory.
- No elevated privileges are needed in the usual sense, as the attacker is manipulating the system's configuration through a design flaw.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was partially addressed in later commits by measuring the config partition and adding it to PCR13, but the issue is still present because the measurement was moved to PCR14, which is not part of the measured boot.
