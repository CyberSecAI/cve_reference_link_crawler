Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input sanitization/validation in `show_image.php` and `otros_sitios.php` allows an attacker to control the file paths being accessed by the application.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization. Specifically, the application does not prevent directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) or arbitrary file paths.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the `image` and `sitio` parameters in the respective php files.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive data such as configuration files, system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), application source code, or database credentials.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application
    *   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `image` and `sitio` parameters

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `Sub_Expresion` parameter in `buscar_integrada.php` is vulnerable to XSS due to improper output encoding/escaping.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input before it's displayed in the web page.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the `Sub_Expresion` parameter in a crafted URL.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application
    *   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `Sub_Expresion` parameter.
