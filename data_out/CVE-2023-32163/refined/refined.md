- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the Wacom Tablet Service due to improper handling of symbolic links.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a link following issue that allows an attacker to create a symbolic link, abusing the service to create a file in a location they would not normally have permissions for.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can escalate privileges to SYSTEM level and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required, involving the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. An attacker creates a symbolic link to manipulate the Tablet Service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
