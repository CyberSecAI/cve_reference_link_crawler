The provided content is related to CVE-2023-43353.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user input in the "Extra" field of the Content - News Menu within CMSmadesimple v.2.2.18. This lack of proper sanitization allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload and inserts it into the "Extra" field of a Content - News Menu item. This payload is stored within the CMS and executed when a user views the page where the news item is displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the CMS backend with the privileges to edit the news menu.
