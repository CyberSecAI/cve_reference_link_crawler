Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-31744.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in the `jpc_dec_process_sod` function of the JPC codec within the Jasper library. Specifically, an assertion failure occurs in the `jpc_streamlist_remove` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
An assertion failure vulnerability exists in the `jpc_streamlist_remove` function at `src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_dec.c:2407`. The issue arises when attempting to remove a stream from the stream list when the stream number is invalid, triggering the assertion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation of this vulnerability results in a program crash due to the assertion failure, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves providing a crafted JPC file that triggers the missing check condition in the `jpc_dec_process_sod` function, leading to the assertion failure in `jpc_streamlist_remove`. The vulnerability is triggered during the decoding process of the crafted JPC file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted JPC file to the Jasper library to trigger the vulnerability. This could involve having the target application process user-supplied JPC files.

The provided content also includes:
- A commit that fixes the issue by adding the missing check.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) file to trigger the vulnerability.
- A gdb log showing the crash.
- Confirmation that the bug has been fixed on the master branch.
