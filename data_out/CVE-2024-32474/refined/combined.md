# Superuser cleartext password leaked in logs

High

[mdtro](/mdtro)
published
GHSA-6cjm-4pxw-7xp9
Apr 18, 2024

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=24.3.0, <24.4.1

## Patched versions

24.4.1

## Description

### Impact

When authenticating as a superuser to a self-hosted Sentry instance with a username and password, the password is leaked as cleartext in logs under the *event*: `auth-index.validate_superuser`. An attacker with access to the log data could use these leaked credentials to login to the Sentry system as superuser.

### Patches

* Self-hosted users on affected versions should upgrade to 24.4.1 or later.
* Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. This vulnerability is not applicable to SaaS.

### Workarounds

Users can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or higher. For details on configuring self-hosted Sentry's logging level see our documentation at: <https://develop.sentry.dev/config/#logging>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
