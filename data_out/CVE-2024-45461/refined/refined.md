Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The CloudStack Quota feature, when enabled, lacks proper access control enforcement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing access check enforcements allow non-administrative CloudStack user accounts to access and modify quota-related configurations and data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Non-administrative users can modify quota-related configurations and data. While the specific impact of this modification isn't detailed, it could potentially disrupt resource allocation, bypass intended usage limits, or lead to other unintended consequences related to quota management.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation requires a non-administrative CloudStack user account.
- The attacker needs to have the Quota feature enabled to be able to modify its settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid non-administrative user account within the affected CloudStack deployment.
- The attacker must have access to the CloudStack environment where the quota feature is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Quota feature is disabled by default, so systems using the default settings are not affected unless enabled by an administrator.
- The advisory suggests a workaround of disabling the Quota plugin if not used.
- The vulnerability affects Apache CloudStack versions 4.7.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1 where the Quota feature is enabled.
- The fix is available in versions 4.18.2.4 and 4.19.1.2 or later.
