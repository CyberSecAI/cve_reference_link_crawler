## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WPDashboardNotes < 1.0.11 - Unauthorised Deletion of Private Notes

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in post\_id= parameter. Authenticated users are able to delete private notes associated with different user accounts. This poses a significant security risk as it violates the principle of least privilege and compromises the integrity and privacy of user data.

### Proof of Concept

After attacker create a note, uses the delete option. Intercepts the request and manipulate the post\_id= to the victim note.
action=wpdn\_delete\_note&post\_id=<ID-TO-DELETE>&nonce=1aa16d2949
