| In what area(s)? /area runtime What version of Dapr? 1.11.2 1.12.2 Expected Behavior I expect that when I proxy a service invocation through dapr using gRPC that the dapr-api-token header is updated to use the app-token-secret instead of the api-token-secret that I sent with my request. Actual Behavior I am instead receiving the same value I sent on the dapr-api-token header to the sidecar in the receiving service. Steps to Reproduce the Problem Setup:   * Run the latest dapr installation * Run a plain gRPC service (C# preferably, though I assume this will happen with any proxied call) * Turn on both `dapr.io/app-token-secret: "app-api-token"` and `dapr.io/api-token-secret: "dapr-api-token"` * Create secrets as described in the documentation   Steps:   * Make a call to the service through dapr transparently (service proxying) * Add `dapr-api-token` header to the request using the `dapi-api-token` secret * Observe the dapr-api-token header, it will not be the `app-api-token` secret, instead it will still be the `dapr-api-token` secret  Release Note RELEASE NOTE: **FIX** dapr-api-token header population for proxied calls |

Would you be interested in opening a PR for this? |

| I'm still facing this issue on runtime 1.13.4 during local development with multiapp run `dapr run -f .`. `APP_API_TOKEN` seems to have no effect at all (setting it either on receiver/caller or both). Only receiving the `dapr-api-token` in my grpc handler, if I add the `DAPR_API_TOKEN` environment variable to the caller service - but the value is from `DAPR_API_TOKEN`.   * I don't expect it to be set on my grpc handler at all (since it is the dapr api token, set on the caller service) * Expect it to be set/overwritten by my specified `APP_API_TOKEN` for this service.   What do I get wrong? [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL) |

What do I get wrong? [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL)  I was confused about this too initially. Setting the env var DAPR\_API\_TOKEN on your services sends the token to dapr for authentication against the secret dapr-api-token. Then the app-api-token secret is sent back to your service and YOU must authenticate the call by hand, which the documentation recommends using an environment variable called APP\_API\_TOKEN for, but could be any env var. |

| [@vermillionsword](https://github.com/vermillionsword) Thanks for your response, I'm still not sure I fully understand this.  **Then the app-api-token secret is sent back**  Are you referring to the value of the DAPR\_API\_TOKEN?  **YOU must authenticate the call by hand**  I understand this, but it did take me some time to grasp it too.  **using an environment variable called APP\_API\_TOKEN for, but could be any env var.**  I think I’m starting to get it, but just to clarify, why not use the same DAPR\_API\_TOKEN again? EDIT: I don’t think the last statement is correct, as the source code explicitly references APP\_API\_TOKEN. |
