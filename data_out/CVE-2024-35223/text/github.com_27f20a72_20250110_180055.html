# Dapr 1.13.3

This update includes bug fixes:

* [App API token forwarded from caller to receiving app](#app-api-token-forwarded-from-caller-to-receiving-app)
* [Upgrade Go version to 1.21.9](#upgrade-go-version-to-1219)
* [Placement server fails to disseminate placement tables](#placement-server-fails-to-disseminate-placement-tables)
* [Restore dapr\_http\_server\_response\_count HTTP metric](#restore-dapr_http_server_response_count-http-metric)

## App API token forwarded from caller to receiving app

### Problem

The caller sidecar is appending the *local* app API token to the *egress* request, thereby leaking the API token protecting the local app to the foreign sidecar.

### Impact

Receiving app can have access to the calling app's API token and make unauthorized calls directly to the originating app - in case it is listening on 0.0.0.0 or an accessible IP address.

### Root cause

A pull request accidentally added this change.

### Solution

Fixed the issue and added integration tests to verify and avoid future regressions.

## Upgrade Go version to 1.21.9

### Problem

Go version 1.21.8 or older are impacted by [CVE-2023-45288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m "CVE-2023-45288").

### Impact

See <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288>

### Root cause

See <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288>

### Solution

Update Go version used to build Dapr.

## Placement server fails to disseminate placement tables

### Problem

In case of an error during dissemination of placement table to a sidecar instance, the dissemination to the remaining instances do not complete. See [#7031](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7031)

### Impact

Sidecars can run with an old copy of the dissemination table and cannot invoke the correct Dapr sidecar for a given actor instance.

### Root cause

During shutdown, all publish calls to the application where being cancelled.

### Solution

Check the return value of performTableDissemination for errors.

## Restore `dapr_http_server_response_count` HTTP metric

### Problem

An existing metrics was removed without deprecation notice, affecting users that relied on it. See [#7642](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7642)

### Impact

Users did not have this specific metric available anymore, potentially impacting their alerts and monitoring.

### Root cause

Metric removed without deprecation notice.

### Solution

Added the metric back.
