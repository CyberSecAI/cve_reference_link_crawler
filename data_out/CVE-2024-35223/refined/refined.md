Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-35223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how Dapr's gRPC proxy handles API tokens during service invocation. Specifically, when proxying a service call, the Dapr sidecar was incorrectly including the *local* `APP_API_TOKEN` of the calling application in the *egress* request to the target application's sidecar. Instead, the receiving sidecar should receive the `APP_API_TOKEN` of the *invoked* app. This was a regression introduced by a prior fix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Token Forwarding:** Dapr was forwarding the calling app's `APP_API_TOKEN` to the receiving app instead of the receiving app's `APP_API_TOKEN`.
*   **API Token Leakage:** This resulted in the receiving application having access to the calling application's API token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The receiving application could use the leaked `APP_API_TOKEN` to make unauthorized calls back to the originating application if it is listening on an accessible IP address, bypassing intended authentication mechanisms.
*   **Security Compromise:** This could lead to a broader compromise of application security, as the leaked token could potentially be used for malicious activities if the application logic does not properly handle it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Service Invocation via gRPC Proxy:** The vulnerability is triggered when a service invocation occurs using Dapr's gRPC proxy.
*   **App API Token Feature Enabled:** The vulnerability is only applicable when the Dapr App API token feature is being utilized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Invoke Services:** The attacker must be able to invoke services through Dapr's gRPC proxy.
*   **Knowledge of App API Token Usage:** The attacker needs to be aware of the app API token being leaked in order to exploit it on the receiving service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced due to an incorrect fix related to app API token handling.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Dapr version 1.13.3, and users are encouraged to upgrade to this version or later.
*   The fix ensures that the correct `APP_API_TOKEN` (of the invoked app) is used when proxying gRPC service invocations.
* The `APP_API_TOKEN` is intended for authenticating from the Dapr sidecar to the app itself, while `DAPR_API_TOKEN` is used by the app to authenticate to the Dapr sidecar.
