| In what area(s)? /area runtime What version of Dapr? 1.11.2 1.12.2 Expected Behavior I expect that when I proxy a service invocation through dapr using gRPC that the dapr-api-token header is updated to use the app-token-secret instead of the api-token-secret that I sent with my request. Actual Behavior I am instead receiving the same value I sent on the dapr-api-token header to the sidecar in the receiving service. Steps to Reproduce the Problem Setup:   * Run the latest dapr installation * Run a plain gRPC service (C# preferably, though I assume this will happen with any proxied call) * Turn on both `dapr.io/app-token-secret: "app-api-token"` and `dapr.io/api-token-secret: "dapr-api-token"` * Create secrets as described in the documentation   Steps:   * Make a call to the service through dapr transparently (service proxying) * Add `dapr-api-token` header to the request using the `dapi-api-token` secret * Observe the dapr-api-token header, it will not be the `app-api-token` secret, instead it will still be the `dapr-api-token` secret  Release Note RELEASE NOTE: **FIX** dapr-api-token header population for proxied calls |

Would you be interested in opening a PR for this? |

| I'm still facing this issue on runtime 1.13.4 during local development with multiapp run `dapr run -f .`. `APP_API_TOKEN` seems to have no effect at all (setting it either on receiver/caller or both). Only receiving the `dapr-api-token` in my grpc handler, if I add the `DAPR_API_TOKEN` environment variable to the caller service - but the value is from `DAPR_API_TOKEN`.   * I don't expect it to be set on my grpc handler at all (since it is the dapr api token, set on the caller service) * Expect it to be set/overwritten by my specified `APP_API_TOKEN` for this service.   What do I get wrong? [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL) |

What do I get wrong? [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL)  I was confused about this too initially. Setting the env var DAPR\_API\_TOKEN on your services sends the token to dapr for authentication against the secret dapr-api-token. Then the app-api-token secret is sent back to your service and YOU must authenticate the call by hand, which the documentation recommends using an environment variable called APP\_API\_TOKEN for, but could be any env var. |

| [@vermillionsword](https://github.com/vermillionsword) Thanks for your response, I'm still not sure I fully understand this.  **Then the app-api-token secret is sent back**  Are you referring to the value of the DAPR\_API\_TOKEN?  **YOU must authenticate the call by hand**  I understand this, but it did take me some time to grasp it too.  **using an environment variable called APP\_API\_TOKEN for, but could be any env var.**  I think I’m starting to get it, but just to clarify, why not use the same DAPR\_API\_TOKEN again? EDIT: I don’t think the last statement is correct, as the source code explicitly references APP\_API\_TOKEN. |

# Dapr 1.13.3

This update includes bug fixes:

* [App API token forwarded from caller to receiving app](#app-api-token-forwarded-from-caller-to-receiving-app)
* [Upgrade Go version to 1.21.9](#upgrade-go-version-to-1219)
* [Placement server fails to disseminate placement tables](#placement-server-fails-to-disseminate-placement-tables)
* [Restore dapr\_http\_server\_response\_count HTTP metric](#restore-dapr_http_server_response_count-http-metric)

## App API token forwarded from caller to receiving app

### Problem

The caller sidecar is appending the *local* app API token to the *egress* request, thereby leaking the API token protecting the local app to the foreign sidecar.

### Impact

Receiving app can have access to the calling app's API token and make unauthorized calls directly to the originating app - in case it is listening on 0.0.0.0 or an accessible IP address.

### Root cause

A pull request accidentally added this change.

### Solution

Fixed the issue and added integration tests to verify and avoid future regressions.

## Upgrade Go version to 1.21.9

### Problem

Go version 1.21.8 or older are impacted by [CVE-2023-45288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m "CVE-2023-45288").

### Impact

See <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288>

### Root cause

See <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288>

### Solution

Update Go version used to build Dapr.

## Placement server fails to disseminate placement tables

### Problem

In case of an error during dissemination of placement table to a sidecar instance, the dissemination to the remaining instances do not complete. See [#7031](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7031)

### Impact

Sidecars can run with an old copy of the dissemination table and cannot invoke the correct Dapr sidecar for a given actor instance.

### Root cause

During shutdown, all publish calls to the application where being cancelled.

### Solution

Check the return value of performTableDissemination for errors.

## Restore `dapr_http_server_response_count` HTTP metric

### Problem

An existing metrics was removed without deprecation notice, affecting users that relied on it. See [#7642](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7642)

### Impact

Users did not have this specific metric available anymore, potentially impacting their alerts and monitoring.

### Root cause

Metric removed without deprecation notice.

### Solution

Added the metric back.

|  |  | # Dapr 1.13.3 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This update includes bug fixes: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - [App API token forwarded from caller to receiving app](#app-api-token-forwarded-from-caller-to-receiving-app) |
|  |  | - [Upgrade Go version to 1.21.9](#upgrade-go-version-to-1219) |
|  |  | - [Placement server fails to disseminate placement tables](#placement-server-fails-to-disseminate-placement-tables) |
|  |  | - [Restore dapr\_http\_server\_response\_count HTTP metric](#restore-dapr\_http\_server\_response\_count-http-metric) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## App API token forwarded from caller to receiving app |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Problem |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The caller sidecar is appending the \*local\* app API token to the \*egress\* request, thereby leaking the API token protecting the local app to the foreign sidecar. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Impact |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Receiving app can have access to the calling app's API token and make unauthorized calls directly to the originating app - in case it is listening on 0.0.0.0 or an accessible IP address. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Root cause |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A pull request accidentally added this change. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Solution |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Fixed the issue and added integration tests to verify and avoid future regressions. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Upgrade Go version to 1.21.9 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Problem |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Go version 1.21.8 or older are impacted by CVE-2023-45288. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Impact |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | See https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Root cause |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | See https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Solution |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Update Go version used to build Dapr. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Placement server fails to disseminate placement tables |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Problem |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In case of an error during dissemination of placement table to a sidecar instance, the dissemination to the remaining instances do not complete. See https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7031 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Impact |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Sidecars can run with an old copy of the dissemination table and cannot invoke the correct Dapr sidecar for a given actor instance. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Root cause |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | During shutdown, all publish calls to the application where being cancelled. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Solution |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Check the return value of performTableDissemination for errors. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Restore `dapr\_http\_server\_response\_count` HTTP metric |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Problem |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | An existing metrics was removed without deprecation notice, affecting users that relied on it. See https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7642 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Impact |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Users did not have this specific metric available anymore, potentially impacting their alerts and monitoring. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Root cause |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Metric removed without deprecation notice. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Solution |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Added the metric back. |

# Dapr API token CVE

Moderate

[artursouza](/artursouza)
published
GHSA-284c-x8m7-9w5h
May 22, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

1.13.0;1.13.1;1.13.2

## Patched versions

1.13.3

## Description

### **Summary**

A vulnerability has been found in Dapr that causes a leak of the application token of the invoker app to the invoked app when using Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation. This issue arises because Dapr sends the app token of the invoker app instead of the app token of the invoked app.

Users who leverage Dapr for gRPC proxy service invocation and are using the app API token feature are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to version [1.13.3](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.13.3).

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who use Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation as well as the [Dapr App API token](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/app-api-token/) functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the app token of the invoker app, potentially compromising security and authentication mechanisms.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in Dapr version [1.13.3](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.13.3).

### Details

Dapr uses two types of tokens for authentication:

* `APP_API_TOKEN`: Used by Dapr to authenticate to the app.
* `DAPR_API_TOKEN`: Used by the app to authenticate to Dapr.

Dapr uses the `dapr-api-token` metadata in gRPC calls (or header, for HTTP calls) for authentication.

* In communication from dapr to the app, the `dapr-api-token` metadata field will carry the `APP_API_TOKEN`.
* In communication from the app to daprd, the `dapr-api-token` metadata field will carry the `DAPR_API_TOKEN`.

Before version 1.13.0, the `APP_API_TOKEN` was not being sent to the invoked app for authentication, as reported in [this issue](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7344). Instead, Dapr was incorrectly using the same `DAPR_API_TOKEN` that the invoker app had passed to Dapr. This was addressed in [PR #7404](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/7404), but the fix only worked for self-invocation scenarios.

When Dapr needed to communicate with another instance, it would mistakenly include the `APP_API_TOKEN` of the invoker app in the request. This behavior is incorrect, app tokens should never be included in requests between Dapr sidecars. This vulnerability allows the receiving app to see the app token of the invoker app, leading to potential misuse and security breaches.

The vulnerability is addressed by ensuring that Dapr uses the correct app token (of the invoked app) during gRPC proxy service invocation.
