Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-3133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the FortiOS web UI, specifically when handling user-supplied data in three different contexts:

1.  **Applications:** When displaying application details, user-controlled data included in the URL path is not sanitized, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution via the `onmouseover` attribute.
2.  **Assign Token:** When assigning tokens to users, the `action` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized leading to XSS.
3. **Replacement Messages:** When editing replacement messages, the content of the message is not properly sanitized before being stored, leading to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS in three forms: reflected XSS in the "Applications" and "Assign Token" contexts, and stored XSS in the "Replacement Messages" context.  This occurs because user-provided input is not properly encoded/sanitized before being included in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (cookie theft)
    *   Defacement of the web interface
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user, if the attacker can bypass CSRF protections.
    *   In the case of the stored XSS, the injected script is executed whenever a user views the affected page, potentially leading to persistent compromise.
*   **Unauthorized actions**: As demonstrated in the video Proof-of-Concept, the attacker can add an admin user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts malicious URLs with XSS payloads embedded in URL parameters, which are then visited by a victim user.
*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker uses the web interface to store malicious javascript code in replacement messages, which will be executed whenever a user views those messages.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker could use phishing or other means to entice a user to visit the malicious URLs or store the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the FortiOS device's web interface. This could be from within the same network or, if the web interface is exposed, from the Internet.
*  **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious URL or perform the specific actions to store the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db.com content provides detailed HTTP request/response examples for each of the three XSS vulnerabilities, which is more information than the FortiGuard advisory.
* The exploit-db.com content references a video PoC showing how to add an administrator user through the XSS vulnerability.
*   The affected FortiOS versions are up to 5.6.0, and the fix is to upgrade to version 5.6.1.
* The CVSS v3 score of 5.3 is for all three vulnerabilities.
