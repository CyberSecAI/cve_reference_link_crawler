Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `signupuser.php` file of the "Online Quiz Site Using PHP With Source Code" project.
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `lid` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied data into SQL queries without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries.
- Lack of Input Validation: There's insufficient verification of user input, specifically for the 'lid' parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: Attackers can bypass authentication and gain direct access to the database.
- Sensitive data leakage: Attackers can retrieve sensitive information stored in the database.
- Data tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- Comprehensive system control: In some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to broader system compromises.
- Service interruption: Attackers might be able to disrupt the normal operation of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is exploited through a POST request to the `signupuser.php` file.
- `lid` parameter: The vulnerable parameter is `lid`, which is part of the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No login is required to exploit the vulnerability. The signup functionality is vulnerable.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL payload within the `lid` parameter.

**Technical details:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject a time-based blind SQL injection payload into the `lid` parameter:
    ```
    lid=admin' AND (SELECT 9033 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xdud) AND 'iqqS'='iqqS&pass=admin&cpass=admin&name=123&address=123&city=12312&phone=773452120&email=123123@qq.com&Submit=Signup
    ```
- The vulnerability is time-based, meaning that the attacker can infer information by observing the delay in the server's response.
- SQLmap was used to identify database details such as database names.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input.
- Implement strict input validation and filtering to ensure the data conforms to expected formats.
- Apply the principle of least privilege by minimizing database user permissions.
- Conduct regular security audits to find and fix potential vulnerabilities.
