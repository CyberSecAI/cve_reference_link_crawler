Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3598

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the ElementsKit Pro plugin's Creative Button widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user inputs when creating a Creative Button, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code. This code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views a page containing the injected button.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary web scripts, leading to various malicious activities such as:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to impersonate users.
    - **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data within the website context.
    - **Website Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the "Creative Button" widget in the ElementsKit Pro plugin.
- An attacker crafts malicious input via the widget's settings.
- This input is stored within the WordPress database.
- When a user views a page with the crafted button, the malicious script executes within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user.
- **Privileges:** The attacker requires at least contributor-level access or higher. This allows them to create or edit pages where the vulnerable Creative Button widget can be inserted.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of ElementsKit Pro up to and including 3.6.0.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 3.6.1.
