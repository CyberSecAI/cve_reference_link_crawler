The provided content relates to a fix for a memory leak in the Linux kernel's SUNRPC implementation, specifically when using RPC over TCP. This directly addresses the issue reported in CVE-2024-35882.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from commit `e18e157bb5c8` which introduced a change to send RPC messages over TCP with a single `sock_sendmsg()` call.
- The issue is that `sock_sendmsg()` does not release all the pages in the underlying `bio_vec` array as was assumed.
- `svc_xprt_release()` is responsible for releasing response pages of the RPC request, but a "record marker page fragment" which is also part of the message, is not included in those released pages.
- Therefore, these marker pages are not released, leading to a memory leak over time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak in the SUNRPC TCP server-side code due to the unreleased page fragment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Exhaustion:** The continuous memory leak eventually exhausts available memory, leading to instability or even denial of service on the affected server, especially on small servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending RPC requests to the server using TCP.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send RPC messages to a vulnerable server using TCP. No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding `page_frag_free(buf)` to explicitly release the memory allocated for the record marker page after the message is sent via `sock_sendmsg()`.
- The original commit `e18e157bb5c8` is identified as the source of the issue.
- The fix is described as a "narrow fix" that can be applied to stable kernels. A more comprehensive solution is in development.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jan Schunk after observing memory exhaustion on small NFS servers.
