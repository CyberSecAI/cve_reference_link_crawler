Subject: [[PATCH net] mctp: serial: Cancel pending work from ndo_uninit handler](#r)
Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2022 09:15:52 +0800	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <20220211011552.1861886-1-jk@codeconstruct.com.au> (<raw>)

We cannot do the cancel_work_sync from after the unregister_netdev, as
the dev pointer is no longer valid, causing a uaf on ldisc unregister
(or device close).

Instead, do the cancel_work_sync from the ndo_uninit op, where the dev
still exists, but the queue has stopped.

Fixes: 7bd9890f3d74 ("mctp: serial: cancel tx work on ldisc close")
