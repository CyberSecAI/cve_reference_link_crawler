Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `woocs_get_custom_price_html` function within the "FOX – Currency Switcher Professional for WooCommerce" plugin.
*   The function uses `do_shortcode` on user-provided data without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the 'value' and 'currency' parameters within the shortcode are being passed unsanitized to the do_shortcode function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary shortcodes due to the use of `do_shortcode` on unsanitized input.
*   **Code Injection:** The lack of sanitization on the `value` and `currency` parameters before being used in the shortcode allows attackers to inject malicious code through shortcodes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code through shortcodes, leading to potential website compromise.
*   **Data Modification/Theft:** Attackers could potentially modify or steal sensitive data from the website.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can deface the website or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially cause a denial-of-service condition by executing resource intensive shortcodes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
*   **Direct Request:** An attacker can directly send a crafted request to the affected function to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server/website.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to know the function to target, which is `woocs_get_custom_price_html`.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions 1.4.2.1 and earlier of the "FOX – Currency Switcher Professional for WooCommerce" plugin.
*   The fix involves using `floatval()` on the `value` parameter and using a sanitized `$curr` variable derived from `$p['currency']`, instead of using `sanitize_text_field` which was not the correct sanitization function.
*   The corrected code also added a check to ensure the currency exists in the `$currencies` array by using sanitize_key on the input.
