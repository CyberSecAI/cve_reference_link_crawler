Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-36813

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper use of the PicoDB library in Kanboard, specifically in how it handles user-provided input during update and insert operations. The code directly uses user-supplied keys (column names) in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is SQL injection. Untrusted user input is used to construct SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied keys used as column names in SQL queries.
- **Bypassing Validation Checks:** Attackers can bypass application-level validation checks by directly manipulating column names via the injection to update arbitrary database fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including session IDs, user credentials (usernames and password hashes), and other application data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining session IDs (e.g., admin session), attackers can elevate their privileges within the application.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify data in the database which can lead to various malicious outcomes depending on the application's logic.
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST requests:** Attackers craft malicious POST requests to vulnerable endpoints (e.g., `ProjectEditController`) with specially crafted payloads.
- **Manipulated Input Parameters:** Attackers exploit the way the application uses `key-value` pairs to construct SQL queries by inserting SQL fragments into the keys which represent column names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a registered and authenticated user of the Kanboard application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable controller and action (e.g. `ProjectEditController`, `update`) and its request format.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to forge HTTP requests with malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple areas of the application where user-controlled arrays are supplied to `model->create` or `model->update` functions.
- The vulnerability was tested against SQLite, but it likely affects other database backends as well.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to extract session IDs by injecting SQL into the `description` parameter in the `ProjectEditController`.
- Patched version is 1.2.31 which includes a fix to sanitize column names in PicoDB. The fix implemented is a regular expression check on the column name to allow only alphanumeric characters and underscore.
- The vulnerability is assigned a high severity with a CVSS score of 7.1.
- The advisory identifies the weakness as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command)
