Root cause of vulnerability:
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in missing checks or incomplete enforcement of security restrictions within the OpenJDK's various components, such as Hotspot, JNDI, Security, Networking, and JSSE, as well as a vulnerability within libpng and Oracle JDK's JavaFX and Serviceability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper field access checks in Hotspot (CVE-2018-3169)
- Incomplete enforcement of trustURLCodebase restrictions in JNDI (CVE-2018-3149)
- Incorrect handling of unsigned attributes in signed Jar manifests (CVE-2018-3136)
- Leak of sensitive header data via HTTP redirect (CVE-2018-3139)
- Missing endpoint identification algorithm check during TLS session resumption (CVE-2018-3180)
- Unrestricted access to scripting engine in Scripting component (CVE-2018-3183)
- Infinite loop in RIFF format reader (CVE-2018-3214)
- Integer overflow and resultant divide-by-zero in pngrutil.c (CVE-2018-13785)
- Unspecified vulnerability in JavaFX (CVE-2018-3209)
- Unspecified vulnerability in Serviceability (CVE-2018-3211)
- Multi-Release attribute read from outside of the main manifest attributes (CVE-2018-3150)

Impact of exploitation:
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
- Remote code execution.
- Sandbox escapes.
- Denial-of-service (DoS).
- Information disclosure.
- Unauthorized modification or reading of data.

Attack vectors:
- Network-based attacks exploiting HTTP, TLS, and other network protocols.
- Maliciously constructed Java applications or applets.
- Specially crafted JAR files.
- Exploiting flaws during TLS session resumption

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network connectivity to the vulnerable system.
- Ability to supply malicious input or files to the system.
- In some cases, user interaction might be required such as running a crafted java application.
- For certain exploits, administrative privileges are required.
