Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `admin/edit_admin.php` file of the Internship Portal Management System 1.0. Specifically, the `admin_id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly handle user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `admin_id` parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can bypass the application's access controls, potentially gaining access to sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Arbitrary Queries:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious SQL code embedded within the `admin_id` parameter to the vulnerable `admin/edit_admin.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is located in `admin/edit_admin.php`, which suggests that administrative functions are affected.
*   The provided GitHub link (`https://github.com/thisissuperann/Vul/blob/main/Internship-Portal-Management-System-04`) confirms the existence of the exploit and code related to the vulnerability.
