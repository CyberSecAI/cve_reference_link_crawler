- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient authentication in some Huawei band products. The band does not sufficiently authenticate the device trying to connect to it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can spoof a legitimate device and connect to the band.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be in the proximity of the band and able to fake device credentials to establish a connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in the same network, be able to fake credentials, and spoof the device.
