Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2024-9007** is related to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in 123Solar version 1.8.4.5, specifically affecting the `detailed.php` file.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of the `$date1` parameter, which is received via a POST request. This parameter is directly used in the HTML output without proper encoding or escaping.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Reflected XSS:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data before incorporating it into the HTML response. This allows malicious scripts to be injected into the webpage, executing when a user views the page.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** Specifically, the `$date1` parameter is taken directly from the POST request (`$_POST['date1']`) and inserted into an HTML input field's `value` attribute without encoding using `htmlspecialchars` as it should have, allowing for XSS injection.
        ```php
        $date1 = $_POST['date1'];
        echo "<input name='date1' id='datepickid' value='$date1' size=7 maxlength=10>";
        ```

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page, allowing for session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
    *   The provided Proof-of-Concept demonstrates how an attacker could inject a script to steal cookies.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to `detailed.php` with a malicious value in the `date1` parameter.
    *   The attacker needs to convince a victim to make a request to `detailed.php` with the attacker's payload.
    
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting 123Solar.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload within the date1 parameter to exploit the reflected XSS.
    
The issue was addressed by using `htmlspecialchars` to encode the `$date1` parameter before outputting it to the HTML, as indicated by the comment from `jeanmarc77`: "fixed with htmlspecialchars".
