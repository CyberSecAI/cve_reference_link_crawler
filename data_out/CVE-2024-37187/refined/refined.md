The provided content is related to CVE-2024-37187.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to weak encoding of user credentials, specifically using base64 encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak Encoding for Password (CWE-261): User credentials are not properly encrypted, making them easily decodable.
- Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79): The web application does not correctly neutralize malicious code when parsing HTTP requests, leading to XSS vulnerability. (This vulnerability is related to CVE-2024-38308 and not the current CVE)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- For CVE-2024-37187: A remote attacker can intercept the easily decodable credentials of a legitimate user to gain full access to the device.
- For CVE-2024-38308: An attacker can plant malicious code on the web page of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- For CVE-2024-37187: Adjacent network access is needed to intercept credentials. User interaction (UI:A) is required.
- For CVE-2024-38308: Adjacent network access is needed to send crafted HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For CVE-2024-37187: The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network of the affected device. No privileges are required, but user interaction is needed to capture credentials.
- For CVE-2024-38308: The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network of the affected device and has to send crafted HTTP requests.
