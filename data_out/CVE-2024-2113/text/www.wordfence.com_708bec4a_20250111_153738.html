### Description

The Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the nf\_download\_all\_subs AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger an export of a form's submission to a publicly accessible location via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
