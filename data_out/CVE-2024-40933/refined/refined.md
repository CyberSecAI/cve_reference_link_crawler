The provided content is related to CVE-2024-40933.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A copy-paste error in the `mlx90635_probe()` function of the `mlx90635` driver caused the code to check the wrong variable (`regmap`) for errors instead of `regmap_ee` after calling `devm_regmap_init_i2c()`. When `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` fails, it returns an error pointer which should be checked using `IS_ERR()`. The incorrect check means that a valid error pointer from `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` assigned to `regmap_ee` could potentially be dereferenced later, causing a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect error checking: the code was checking `regmap` for errors instead of `regmap_ee`, which could lead to dereferencing an error pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic: Dereferencing an error pointer can cause the kernel to panic, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by failing to allocate the regmap during device initialization. This is done by returning an error pointer from the `devm_regmap_init_i2c` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position where they can trigger the loading of the `mlx90635` driver with an I2C device where the regmap allocation can fail
