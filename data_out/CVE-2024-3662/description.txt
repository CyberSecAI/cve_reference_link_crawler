The WPZOOM Social Feed Widget & Block plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the wpzoom_instagram_clear_data() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete all Instagram images installed on the site.
