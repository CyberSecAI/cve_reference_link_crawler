Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `wpzoom_instagram_clear_data()` function within the WPZOOM Social Feed Widget & Block plugin. This function is responsible for deleting all Instagram images from the Media Library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is that the `wpzoom_instagram_clear_data()` function lacked a capability check. This means that the function could be accessed and executed by any authenticated user, regardless of their role or permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** An attacker with subscriber-level access could exploit this vulnerability to delete all Instagram images from the victim's WordPress website's media library. This results in data loss and potential disruption of the site's functionality if those images were used elsewhere.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the WordPress site's web interface.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, but with minimal privileges (subscriber role or higher).
- **AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX request, which is then processed by the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- **Understanding of WordPress AJAX:** The attacker should know how WordPress handles AJAX requests to interact with the vulnerable endpoint.
