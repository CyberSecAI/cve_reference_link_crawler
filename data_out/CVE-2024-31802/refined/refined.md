Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flawed coupon validation functionality within the DESIGNA ABACUS system. The system uses QR codes to represent vouchers for parking, and the encoding structure allows manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure QR Code Generation:** The QR code encoding structure includes a "Valor" (value) and "QTD" (quantity) field, which an attacker can modify.
*   **Lack of Proper Validation:** The system does not properly validate the "Valor" and "QTD" fields in the QR code, allowing for forged values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Payment Bypass:** Attackers can create crafted QR codes with inflated "Valor" fields, allowing them to park without paying or receive discounts they are not entitled to.
*   **Financial Loss:** The vulnerability results in financial losses for the parking operator.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted QR Code:** The attacker needs to generate a QR code with modified "Valor" and "QTD" fields.
*   **System Input:** The crafted QR code is then input into the DESIGNA ABACUS system through a QR code scanner at the parking payment machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of QR Code Structure:** The attacker needs to understand the encoding structure used by the system to generate valid but manipulated QR codes.
*   **Access to QR Code Scanner:** The attacker needs physical access to a DESIGNA ABACUS system or a method to provide the crafted QR code to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in DESIGNA ABACUS versions Basic and Premium (all versions) up to and including version 18.
*   No public exploits are available at the time of this report.
*   The attack type is described as "Context-dependent".
