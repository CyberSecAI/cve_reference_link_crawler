Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-21837

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The software does not properly control the search path used to load resources or executables. This allows an attacker to potentially introduce malicious files into the search path, which could then be loaded and executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege: An attacker with local access and the ability to influence the search path can potentially execute code with elevated privileges. This could lead to full system compromise or access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- Authenticated user: The vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated user.
- User interaction: The user likely needs to perform some action that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker must be able to influence the search path used by the Intel Quartus Prime software.

**Affected Products:**
- Intel速 Quartus速 Prime Lite Edition Design software before version 23.1.

**Mitigation:**
- Update Intel速 Quartus速 Prime Lite Edition Design software to version 23.1 or later.
