The content is related to CVE-2022-36801.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS) issue present in the TeamManagement.jspa endpoint due to insufficient sanitization of the "planUrl" parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the user's browser session, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing session cookies and credentials
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the application
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the JavaScript code within the `planUrl` parameter and lures the victim into accessing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and trick the victim into clicking on it. They can be a remote unauthenticated attacker, since the affected endpoint does not require authentication.
