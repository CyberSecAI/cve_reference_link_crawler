Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-37755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The i-doit application, in versions up to v25, includes hardcoded default credentials for several accounts, some of which have elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The most significant vulnerability is the presence of default usernames and passwords, specifically "admin" / "admin", that can be used to log in with administrative privileges.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The application does not enforce proper access control measures during initial setup, allowing unauthorized access through default credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Compromise:** An attacker gaining access using the default credentials can potentially escalate privileges, compromising the entire system.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain full administrative access to the i-doit application by simply using the default credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Login:** Attackers can directly access the main login page of the i-doit application and log in using the hardcoded "admin" / "admin" credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the i-doit application's login page.
- **Basic Knowledge:** No advanced technical skills are needed, only the knowledge of the default credentials.

**Additional details from github content:**
- The vulnerability exists because there is no option to set up admin credentials during the initial setup of the application.
- The application owner is not prompted to create an initial administrative user.
- The application's admin-center, used for managing licenses and other high-level tasks, is accessible after logging in using the default credentials.

In summary, the vulnerability lies in the fact that i-doit v25 and below ships with default admin credentials that are not changed during initial setup, allowing anyone to gain administrative access with minimal effort.
