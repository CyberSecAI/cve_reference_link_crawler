| This issue is the same as [#28](https://github.com/rockcarry/ffjpeg/issues/28) (assigned with [CVE-2020-23852](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-23852)) and [#24](https://github.com/rockcarry/ffjpeg/issues/24) (assigned [CVE-2020-13439](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13439)).
