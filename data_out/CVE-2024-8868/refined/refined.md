Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8868

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `savedata.php` file of the "Crud Operation System" project. This is due to insufficient input validation of the `sname` parameter. The application directly uses the value of the `sname` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of SQL injection, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
*   **System Control:** Attackers can potentially gain comprehensive control over the system.
*  **Service Interruption**: The attack can lead to service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `savedata.php`.
*   **`sname` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the `sname` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided information indicates that no login or authorization is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `savedata.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `sname`
*   **Exploitation Method:** Time-based blind SQL injection
*  **Payload Example:** `sname=1' AND (SELECT 2172 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))YnZV) AND 'OooQ'='OooQ&saddress=1&class=2&sphone=1`

**Mitigation:**

*   **Prepared Statements:** Implement prepared statements with parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Input Validation:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize the database user permissions to prevent potential misuse.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.
