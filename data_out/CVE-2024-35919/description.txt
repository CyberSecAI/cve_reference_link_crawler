In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mediatek: vcodec: adding lock to protect encoder context list

Add a lock for the ctx_list, to avoid accessing a NULL pointer
within the 'vpu_enc_ipi_handler' function when the ctx_list has
been deleted due to an unexpected behavior on the SCP IP block.
