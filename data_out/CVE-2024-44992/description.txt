In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb/client: avoid possible NULL dereference in cifs_free_subrequest()

Clang static checker (scan-build) warning:
	cifsglob.h:line 890, column 3
	Access to field 'ops' results in a dereference of a null pointer.

Commit 519be989717c ("cifs: Add a tracepoint to track credits involved in
R/W requests") adds a check for 'rdata->server', and let clang throw this
warning about NULL dereference.

When 'rdata->credits.value != 0 && rdata->server == NULL' happens,
add_credits_and_wake_if() will call rdata->server->ops->add_credits().
This will cause NULL dereference problem. Add a check for 'rdata->server'
to avoid NULL dereference.
