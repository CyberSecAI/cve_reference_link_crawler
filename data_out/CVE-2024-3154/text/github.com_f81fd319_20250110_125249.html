I totally forgot about this internal annotation. We should probably see if we can remove it...

(I suspect we also always override it, so it's technically not unsafe but it's better to be safe than sorry.)

| Linking:   * [GHSA-c5pj-mqfh-rvc3 "Runc allows an arbitrary systemd property to be injected" is a misunderstood vulnerability. Users do NOT need to update runc. #4263](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4263)   This PR is misunderstood to fix the GHSA, but it actually does not, as the vuln is not on runc side. Users need to update CRI-O, not runc. |
