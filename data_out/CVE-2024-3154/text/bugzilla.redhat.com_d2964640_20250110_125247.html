| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2272532#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2024-04-01 19:13:02 UTC  ``` On CRI-O, it looks like an arbitrary systemd property can be injected via a Pod annotation. This means that any user who can create a pod with an arbitrary annotation may perform an arbitrary action on the host system.
