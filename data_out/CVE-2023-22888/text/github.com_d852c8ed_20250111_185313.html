### @ephraimbuddy **[ephraimbuddy](/ephraimbuddy)** commented [Jun 30, 2023](#issue-1783222251)

This commit sanitizes the DagRun.run\_id parameter by introducing a configurable option. Users now have the ability to select a specific run\_id pattern for their runs, ensuring stricter control over the values used. This update does not impact the default run\_id generation performed by the scheduler for scheduled DAG runs or for Dag runs triggered without modifying the run\_id parameter in the run configuration page. The configuration flexibility empowers users to align the run\_id pattern with their specific requirements.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[rickyzhang82](/rickyzhang82)** commented [Jul 12, 2023](#issuecomment-1633002304)

| [@ephraimbuddy](https://github.com/ephraimbuddy)  It is unclear to me how DAG RUN ID could exploit illegal file access, given the limited information from [CVE-2023-22887](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22887).  But rather than fixing the root cause, we impose a default regex pattern check `allowed_run_id_pattern = ^[A-Za-z0-9_.~:+-]+$`.  How can we guarantee that the string from this pattern won't generate any malicious code? Shouldn't we address the root cause instead? We don't fix the SQL injection by limiting the string from users with regex. We validate the SQL string with prepared statements. Regex itself is not a validation but a restriction. |
