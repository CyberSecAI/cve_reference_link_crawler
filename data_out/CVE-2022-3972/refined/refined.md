The provided content details two SQL injection vulnerabilities in the HMS-PHP project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input. The application directly uses the `uname` and `pass` parameters from POST requests in SQL queries without any form of sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection in `adminlogin.php`
- SQL injection in `admin/admin.php`
- Lack of input sanitization/validation.
- Direct use of user input in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration
  - Data modification
  - Privilege escalation
  - Full database compromise
  - Possible Remote code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints (`adminlogin.php` and `admin/admin.php`). No authentication is needed for exploitation if they can inject SQL code in the user field.

**Specific details from the content:**

- **Vulnerable code:** The vulnerabilities occur because the `$username` and `$password` variables in `adminlogin.php` and the `$uname` and `$pass` variables in `admin/admin.php` are directly used in SQL queries without any sanitization or escaping.
- **PoCs:** The content provides example POST requests that demonstrate the exploitation of both vulnerabilities:
    - **`adminlogin.php`:** A time-based blind SQL injection is demonstrated to bypass authentication.
    - **`admin/admin.php`:**  A time-based blind SQL injection is demonstrated.
- **Environment:** The vulnerabilities were tested under Apache 2.4.39, MySQL 5.7.26, and PHP 7.3.4
