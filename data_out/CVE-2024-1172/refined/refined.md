### Summary:
The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Essential Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin, specifically within its Accordion widget.

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
- The vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the plugin's Accordion widget, specifically in the `Adv_Accordion.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when creating accordion tabs, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that use the vulnerable Accordion widget. When a user accesses an injected page, the malicious scripts will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to various impacts such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing websites
    - Stealing sensitive user data.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the Accordion widget's settings, by adding the scripts into a "Tab Title", or a "Tab Content".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor-level" permissions. This level of access allows the attacker to edit posts and pages where the vulnerable Accordion widget can be inserted and manipulated.
