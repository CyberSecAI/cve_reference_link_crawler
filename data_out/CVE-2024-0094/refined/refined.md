- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in the NVIDIA vGPU software for Linux within the Virtual GPU Manager, where an untrusted guest VM can cause improper control of the interaction frequency in the host.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper control of interaction frequency.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires a malicious guest VM to interact with the Virtual GPU Manager in a way that causes improper control of the interaction frequency on the host.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have control of an untrusted guest VM to exploit the vulnerability.
