{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because the TCM (Traffic Classification Manager) is not paused when the firmware is stopped, leading to a host command being sent to the transport while the firmware is inactive.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code fails to properly handle the state of the firmware, sending commands to a non-running firmware.",
     "Missing state check before sending a host command."
    ],
    "impact": "Sending a host command to the transport while the firmware is not alive triggers a WARNING, which might lead to instability or unexpected behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by stopping the device which leads to calling iwl_trans_send_cmd, a function that interacts with the hardware via the transport, without pausing the TCM when the firmware is stopped.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to stop and then interact with the wireless device using affected drivers. "
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves pausing the TCM (Traffic Classification Manager) when the firmware is stopped. This is achieved by adding the `iwl_mvm_pause_tcm(mvm, false);` call in the `iwl_mvm_stop_device` function, before stopping the transport. This ensures that no commands are sent when the firmware is not running.",
    "The fix is present in the provided diffs as an addition of iwl\_mvm\_pause\_tcm before the call to iwl\_trans\_stop\_device."
