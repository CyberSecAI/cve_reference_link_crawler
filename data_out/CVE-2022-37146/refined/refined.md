{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application's response times for valid and invalid users differed, allowing attackers to distinguish between them.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Username enumeration vulnerability via HTTP response timing differences."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could identify valid usernames (email addresses), making it easier to conduct brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and targeted social engineering attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending login or password reset requests, an attacker can measure the response time to differentiate between valid and invalid usernames.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and measure response times."
