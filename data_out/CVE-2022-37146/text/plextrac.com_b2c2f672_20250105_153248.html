## Harness the Power of One Platform & Several Powerful Solutions

PlexTrac automates pentest planning, reporting, and findings delivery so offensive security teams can be more efficient and focus on the security work that moves the needle.

Assessments
Create and deploy simple scoping questionnaires or complex security frameworks like CMMC 2.0 with unparalleled flexibility.

Reports
Leverage AI to create quality pentest reports faster — giving everyone more time to focus on finding and fixing vulnerabilities.
