The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2022-30955:

**CVE-2022-30955**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint within the GitLab Plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access a specific endpoint.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. These IDs can then potentially be used in other attacks to capture the actual credentials.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected plugin:** GitLab Plugin

**Affected versions:** 1.5.31 and earlier.
**Fixed version:** 1.5.32

The advisory states that "An enumeration of credentials IDs in GitLab Plugin 1.5.32 requires the appropriate permissions."
