- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure storage of encryption keys for ICT MIFARE and DESFire cards within the firmware binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Default encryption keys are embedded in the firmware, making them publicly available.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious actors can create credentials for any site code and card number that uses the default ICT encryption. This allows unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation involves extracting the default keys from the firmware and using them to clone or create new cards.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs access to the firmware binary and tools to generate cards using the extracted keys.
