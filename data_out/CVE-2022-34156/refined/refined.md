- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper server certificate verification in the "Hulu / ãã¼ã«ã¼" App for iOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly validate server certificates, which is identified as CWE-295.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can intercept and eavesdrop on encrypted communication between the application and the server.
- **Attack vectors**: A network-based MITM attack, specifically by setting up a malicious wireless LAN access point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, such as by operating a malicious wireless access point. The complexity of the attack is high and no privileges or user interaction are required.
