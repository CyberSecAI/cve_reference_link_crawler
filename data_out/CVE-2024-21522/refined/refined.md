Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation for the `frameSize` parameter in the `decode` and `decodeFloat` functions of the `OpusDecoder` class within the `audify` library. Specifically, the code fails to check if `frameSize` is negative before using it to determine the size of an array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index:** The core issue is that the code doesn't validate if the provided `frameSize` is a non-negative value. It directly uses this unchecked value in array length calculations, which can result in allocating arrays with invalid sizes (negative sizes).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Providing a negative `frameSize` will lead to a process crash due to `std::bad_array_new_length` exception. This results in the application becoming unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a negative integer as the `frameSize` parameter to the `decode` or `decodeFloat` functions of `OpusDecoder`.
- This can occur wherever user input is used to set the `frameSize` or if the library is used in a way where this parameter is not controlled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- They simply need to be able to call the `decode` or `decodeFloat` functions with a negative value for `frameSize`. This may involve network access if the program is network enabled, but the attack can occur locally within the program.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `opus_decoder.cpp` file, specifically at lines 53 and 79.
- Proof of concept (PoC) code is provided, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be triggered using Node.js.
