| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1805135#c0)  Marian Rehak    2020-02-20 10:49:58 UTC  ``` Under certain circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 hypervisor into accessing sensitive L1 resources that are supposed to be inaccessible to the L2 guest according to L1 hypervisor configuration.  Only Intel processors are affected. It requires netsted virtualization to be enabled, ie. kvm-intel.nested=1.
