{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-2732",
  "description": "Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is enabled.  This could allow an L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in the L1 guest.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The KVM implementation for Intel processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualization is enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper instruction emulation in nested virtualization.",
      "Missing checks for I/O or MSR interception bitmaps."
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in the L1 guest.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious L2 guest can exploit the flaw to gain access to L1 resources.",
      "Specifically, an L2 guest could trick the L0 hypervisor into accessing sensitive L1 resources that are supposed to be inaccessible to the L2 guest."
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to control an L2 guest and nested virtualization needs to be enabled (kvm-intel.nested=1)"
  }
