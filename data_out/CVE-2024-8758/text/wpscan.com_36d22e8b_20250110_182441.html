## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Quiz and Survey Master (QSM) < 9.1.3 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1) Create a new Quiz.
2) Add first question
3) Go to options "Display"
4) Change Custom field in "Advanced settings" to "&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;"
5) Go to http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=qsm\_quiz\_tools click on the log for the added Quiz to see the XSS
