Date:   Wed Aug 21 12:49:34 2024 +0200

    Remove XML_DTD guards before is_param accesses

    As a part of the ENTITY struct, is_param is correctly initialized even
    when XML_DTD is not defined. This can be seen in the 'lookup' function,
    which sets all the ENTITY memory, including the is_param flag, to zero
    during the ENTITY creation. Additionally, is_param can only be assigned
    XML_TRUE when XML_DTD is defined, which makes XML_DTD checks before
    is_param accesses not necessary.

    Currently, some of the is_param accesses are guarded by the XML_DTD and
    some not. This commit removes all XML_DTD guards that are meant for
    is_param accesses.

    Drop dependency on GNU sed.

    GNU sed supports `-i` (in-place editing) with an optional suffix for the
    backup copy.  Non-GNU implementations also support `-i`, but the suffix
    is not optional.  Replacing all occurrences of naked `-i` with `-i.bak`
    ensures our scripts work equally well with both.

    Merge pull request #865 from Ferenc-/fix-define-for-linux-syscall

    Fix `check_c_source_compiles` of `HAVE_SYSCALL_GETRANDOM`

commit 73627c7456db80db5d537f178132978b686c6fb7
Author: Ferenc G√©czi <ferenc.gm@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 27 00:00:01 2024 +0000

    Use feature test macro for syscall prototype

    In order to cover the largest number of glibc and musl libc versions,
    withouth warnings, the decision here is to use `_GNU_SOURCE`,
    even if it enables a larger than necessary feature set.

    A feature macro is needed, because otherwise the `check_c_source_compiles`
    for `HAVE_SYSCALL_GETRANDOM` fails in cases when for example
    the default compiler flags include `-std=c99`:

    ````
    src.c:6:13: error: implicit declaration of function ‚Äòsyscall‚Äô [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
        6 |             syscall(SYS_getrandom, NULL, 0, 0);
          |             ^~~~~~~
    ````
    But this check should pass, as `SYS_getrandom` is available,
    only the declaration of `syscall` in `unistd.h` is conditional behind a macro.

    The exact minimal public macros, for enabling this are in `features.h`, and
    are version dependent.

    According to [5.04](
    https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages/Archive/man-pages-5.04.tar.gz)
    and older versions of the `man 2 syscall` page,
    the recommended feature test macro is `_GNU_SOURCE`.
    Later on in [5.05](
    https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages/Archive/man-pages-5.05.tar.gz)
    this statement has changed, to provide a smaller minimal feature set.
    Namely up to `glibc 2.18`  is `_BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE`,
    but after that the `_DEFAULT_SOURCE` is recommended,
    and `_BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE` is deprecated, and emits warning in later versions.
    Regardless of that the `_GNU_SOURCE` is still fully supported
    in every version and is suitable for our purposes.

    The musl libc doesn't use `_SVID_SOURCE` at all, but `_BSD_SOURCE` always works,
    plus in some newer versions `_DEFAULT_SOURCE` also sets `_BSD_SOURCE`,
    but `_GNU_SOURCE` covers the largest set of versions and is unlikely
    to be deprecated in the future.

    Further info about feature test macros:

    In glibc:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Feature-Test-Macros.html

    In musl libc under the `Feature Test Macros Supported by musl` section:

Date:   Wed Apr 3 00:44:10 2024 +0200

    cmake: Fix check for symbols `size_t` and `off_t`

    The two issues with the previous approach were that:

    1. `check_symbol_exists` would store \"1\" or \"\" into
       variable `off_t` rather than string \"off_t\", and

    2. (`check_symbol_exists` would not find `off_t` or
       `size_t` on modern Linux).

    Was reported with NetBSD 9.3.

    `size_t` is part of C99 (which Expat requires), so
    only the `off_t` half remains.

    Always provide path to find.

    Running find without path is a GNU extension.  GNU find uses current
    directory as starting-point in this case.  Better always use an
    explicit . in build scripts to support find on other systems.

    tests: Cover amplification tracking for isolated external parser

commit 1d50b80cf31de87750103656f6eb693746854aa8
Author: Sebastian Pipping <sebastian@pipping.org>
Date:   Mon Mar 4 23:49:06 2024 +0100

    lib/xmlparse.c: Detect billion laughs attack with isolated external parser

    When parsing DTD content with code like ..

      XML_Parser parser = XML_ParserCreate(NULL);
      XML_Parser ext_parser = XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate(parser, NULL, NULL);
      enum XML_Status status = XML_Parse(ext_parser, doc, (int)strlen(doc), XML_TRUE);

    .. there are 0 bytes accounted as direct input and all input from `doc` accounted
    as indirect input.  Now function accountingGetCurrentAmplification cannot calculate
    the current amplification ratio as \"(direct + indirect) / direct\", and it did refuse
    to divide by 0 as one would expect, but it returned 1.0 for this case to indicate
    no amplification over direct input.  As a result, billion laughs attacks from
    DTD-only input were not detected with this isolated way of using an external parser.

    The new approach is to assume direct input of length not 0 but 22 -- derived from
    ghost input \"<!ENTITY a SYSTEM 'b'>\", the shortest possible way to include an external
    DTD --, and do the usual \"(direct + indirect) / direct\" math with \"direct := 22\".

    GitHub issue #839 has more details on this issue and its origin in ClusterFuzz
    finding 66812.

    tests: Replace clock counting with scanned bytes in linear-time test

    This removes the dependency on CLOCKS_PER_SEC that prevented this test
    from running properly on some platforms, as well as the inherent
    flakiness of time measurements.

    Since later commits have introduced g_bytesScanned (and before that,
    g_parseAttempts), we can use that value as a proxy for parse time
    instead of clock().

    tests: Check heuristic bypass with varying buffer fill sizes

    The bypass works on the assumption that the application uses a
    consistent fill size. Let's make some assertions about what should
    happen when the application doesn't do that -- most importantly,
    that parsing does happen eventually, and that the number of scanned
    bytes doesn't explode.

    tests: Make it clear to clang-tidy that assert_true may not return

    The key is to have __attribute__((noreturn)) somewhere that clang-tidy
    can see it. In this case, this is the _fail() function, which is
    conditionally called from the assert_true() macro.

    This will ensure that clang-tidy doesn't complain about NULL values
    that we've asserted against in tests.

    Bypass partial token heuristic when nearing full buffer

    ...instead of only when approaching the maximum buffer size INT/2+1.

    We'd like to give applications a chance to finish parsing a large token
    before buffer reallocation, in case the reallocation fails.

    By bypassing the reparse deferral heuristic when getting close to the
    filling the buffer, we give them this chance -- if the whole token is
    present in the buffer, it will be parsed at that time.

    This may come at the cost of some extra reparse attempts. For a token
    of n bytes, these extra parses cause us to scan over a maximum of
    2n bytes (... + n/8 + n/4 + n/2 + n). Therefore, parsing of big tokens
    remains O(n) in regard how many bytes we scan in attempts to parse. The
    cost in reality is lower than that, since the reparses that happen due
    to the bypass will affect m_partialTokenBytesBefore, delaying the next
    ratio-based reparse. Furthermore, only the first token that \"breaks
    through\" a buffer ceiling takes that extra reparse attempt; subsequent
    large tokens will only bypass the heuristic if they manage to hit the
    new buffer ceiling.

    Note that this cost analysis depends on the assumption that Expat grows
    its buffer by doubling it (or, more generally, grows it exponentially).
    If this changes, the cost of this bypass may increase. Hopefully, this
    would be caught by test_big_tokens_take_linear_time or the new test.

    The bypass logic assumes that the application uses a consistent fill.
    If the app increases its fill size, it may miss the bypass (and the
    normal heuristic will apply). If the app decreases its fill size, the
    bypass may be hit multiple times for the same buffer size. The very
    worst case would be to always fill half of the remaining buffer space,
    in which case parsing of a large n-byte token becomes O(n log n).

    As an added bonus, the new test case should be faster than the old one,
    since it doesn't have to go all the way to 1GiB to check the behavior.

    Finally, this change necessitated a small modification to two existing
    tests related to reparse deferral. These tests are testing the deferral
    enabled setting, and assume that reparsing will not happen for any other
    reason. By pre-growing the buffer, we make sure that this new deferral
    does not affect those test cases.

    Bypass partial token heuristic when close to maximum buffer size

    For huge tokens, we may end up in a situation where the partial token
    parse deferral heuristic demands more bytes than Expat's maximum buffer
    size (currently ~half of INT_MAX) could fit.

    INT_MAX/2 is 1024 MiB on most systems. Clearly, a token of 950 MiB could
    fit in that buffer, but the reparse threshold might be such that
    callProcessor() will defer it, allowing the app to keep filling the
    buffer until XML_GetBuffer() eventually returns a memory error.

    By bypassing the heuristic when we're getting close to the maximum
    buffer size, it will once again be possible to parse tokens in the size
    range INT_MAX/2/ratio < size < INT_MAX/2 reliably.

    We subtract the last buffer fill size as a way to detect that the next
    XML_GetBuffer() call has a risk of returning a memory error -- assuming
    that the application is likely to keep using the same (or smaller) fill.

    We subtract XML_CONTEXT_BYTES because that's the maximum amount of bytes
    that could remain at the start of the buffer, preceding the partial
    token. Technically, it could be fewer bytes, but XML_CONTEXT_BYTES is
    normally small relative to INT_MAX, and is much simpler to use.

    len=0 was previously OK if there had previously been a non-zero call.
    It makes sense to allow an application to work the same way on a
    newly-created parser, and not have to care if its incoming buffer
    happens to be 0.

    When the parse buffer contains the starting bytes of a token but not
    all of them, we cannot parse the token to completion. We call this a
    partial token.  When this happens, the parse position is reset to the
    start of the token, and the parse() call returns. The client is then
    expected to provide more data and call parse() again.

    In extreme cases, this means that the bytes of a token may be parsed
    many times: once for every buffer refill required before the full token
    is present in the buffer.

    Math:
      Assume there's a token of T bytes
      Assume the client fills the buffer in chunks of X bytes
      We'll try to parse X, 2X, 3X, 4X ... until mX == T (technically >=)
      That's (m¬≤+m)X/2 = (T¬≤/X+T)/2 bytes parsed (arithmetic progression)
      While it is alleviated by larger refills, this amounts to O(T¬≤)

    Expat grows its internal buffer by doubling it when necessary, but has
    no way to inform the client about how much space is available. Instead,
    we add a heuristic that skips parsing when we've repeatedly stopped on
    an incomplete token. Specifically:

     * Only try to parse if we have a certain amount of data buffered
     * Every time we stop on an incomplete token, double the threshold
     * As soon as any token completes, the threshold is reset

    This means that when we get stuck on an incomplete token, the threshold
    grows exponentially, effectively making the client perform larger buffer
    fills, limiting how many times we can end up re-parsing the same bytes.

    Math:
      Assume there's a token of T bytes
      Assume the client fills the buffer in chunks of X bytes
      We'll try to parse X, 2X, 4X, 8X ... until (2^k)X == T (or larger)
      That's (2^(k+1)-1)X bytes parsed -- e.g. 15X if T = 8X
      This is equal to 2T-X, which amounts to O(T)

    We could've chosen a faster growth rate, e.g. 4 or 8. Those seem to
    increase performance further, at the cost of further increasing the
    risk of growing the buffer more than necessary. This can easily be
    adjusted in the future, if desired.

    This is all completely transparent to the client, except for:
    1. possible delay of some callbacks (when our heuristic overshoots)
    2. apps that never do isFinal=XML_TRUE could miss data at the end

    For the affected testdata, this change shows a 100-400x speedup.
    The recset.xml benchmark shows no clear change either way.

    Before:
    benchmark -n ../testdata/largefiles/recset.xml 65535 3
      3 loops, with buffer size 65535. Average time per loop: 0.270223

      3 loops, with buffer size 4096. Average time per loop: 0.018027
    benchmark -n ../testdata/largefiles/aaaaaa_comment.xml 4096 3

    benchmark -n ../testdata/largefiles/aaaaaa_text.xml 4096 3
      3 loops, with buffer size 4096. Average time per loop: 0.019362

    After:
    ./run.sh benchmark -n ../testdata/largefiles/recset.xml 65535 3
      3 loops, with buffer size 65535. Average time per loop: 0.269030

    tests: Use normal XML_Parse in test_suspend_resume_internal_entity

    When the parser is suspended, _XML_Parse_SINGLE_BYTES() will return
    early. At that point, there could be some amount of bytes that haven't
    been fed into Expat at all yet. This leaves us with an incomplete
    document.

    Furthermore, the last internal XML_Parse() call with isFinal=XML_TRUE
    will not have happened, so the parser will not know that no more input
    is to be expected. This is what allowed the test to pass when it was
    originally changed to use SINGLE_BYTES.

    With the new partial token heuristic, the lack of a final parse call
    means that we don't even reach the \"Ho\" text, and fail the test.

    The simplest solution is to go back to using XML_Parse() in this test.
    Another option would be to let SINGLE_BYTES expose how far it got in
    its loop, allowing for later continuation, but it doesn't seem worth the
    extra complexity.

    Add aaaaaa_*.xml with unreasonably large tokens

    Some of these currently take a very long time to parse. I set those to
    only run one loop in the run-benchmark make target.

    4096 may be a fairly small buffer, and definitely make the problem worse
    than it otherwise would've been, but similar sizes exist in real code:

     * 2048 bytes in cpython Modules/pyexpat.c
     * 4096 bytes in skia SkXMLParser.cpp
     * BUFSIZ bytes (8192 on my machine) in expat/examples

    The files, too, are inspired by real-life examples: Android stores
    depth and gain maps as base64-encoded JPEGs inside the XMP data of
    other JPEGs. Sometimes as a text element, sometimes as an attribute
    value. I've seen attribute values slightly over 5 MiB in size.

    Remove XML_DTD guards before is_param accesses

    As a part of the ENTITY struct, is_param is correctly initialized even
    when XML_DTD is not defined. This can be seen in the 'lookup' function,
    which sets all the ENTITY memory, including the is_param flag, to zero
    during the ENTITY creation. Additionally, is_param can only be assigned
    XML_TRUE when XML_DTD is defined, which makes XML_DTD checks before
    is_param accesses not necessary.

    Currently, some of the is_param accesses are guarded by the XML_DTD and
    some not. This commit removes all XML_DTD guards that are meant for
    is_param accesses.

    Drop dependency on GNU sed.

    GNU sed supports `-i` (in-place editing) with an optional suffix for the
    backup copy.  Non-GNU implementations also support `-i`, but the suffix
    is not optional.  Replacing all occurrences of naked `-i` with `-i.bak`
    ensures our scripts work equally well with both.

    Merge pull request #865 from Ferenc-/fix-define-for-linux-syscall

    Fix `check_c_source_compiles` of `HAVE_SYSCALL_GETRANDOM`

commit 73627c7456db80db5d537f178132978b686c6fb7
Author: Ferenc G√©czi <ferenc.gm@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 27 00:00:01 2024 +0000

    Use feature test macro for syscall prototype

    In order to cover the largest number of glibc and musl libc versions,
    withouth warnings, the decision here is to use `_GNU_SOURCE`,
    even if it enables a larger than necessary feature set.

    A feature macro is needed, because otherwise the `check_c_source_compiles`
    for `HAVE_SYSCALL_GETRANDOM` fails in cases when for example
    the default compiler flags include `-std=c99`:

    ````
    src.c:6:13: error: implicit declaration of function ‚Äòsyscall‚Äô [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
        6 |             syscall(SYS_getrandom, NULL, 0, 0);
          |             ^~~~~~~
    ````
    But this check should pass, as `SYS_getrandom` is available,
    only the declaration of `syscall` in `unistd.h` is conditional behind a macro.

    The exact minimal public macros, for enabling this are in `features.h`, and
    are version dependent.

    According to [5.04](
    https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages/Archive/man-pages-5.04.tar.gz)
    and older versions of the `man 2 syscall` page,
    the recommended feature test macro is `_GNU_SOURCE`.
    Later on in [5.05](
    https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages/Archive/man-pages-5.05.tar.gz)
    this statement has changed, to provide a smaller minimal feature set.
    Namely up to `glibc 2.18`  is `_BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE`,
    but after that the `_DEFAULT_SOURCE` is recommended,
    and `_BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE` is deprecated, and emits warning in later versions.
    Regardless of that the `_GNU_SOURCE` is still fully supported
    in every version and is suitable for our purposes.

    The musl libc doesn't use `_SVID_SOURCE` at all, but `_BSD_SOURCE` always works,
    plus in some newer versions `_DEFAULT_SOURCE` also sets `_BSD_SOURCE`,
    but `_GNU_SOURCE` covers the largest set of versions and is unlikely
    to be deprecated in the future.

    Further info about feature test macros:

    In glibc:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Feature-Test-Macros.html

    In musl libc under the `Feature Test Macros Supported by musl` section:

    cmake: Fix check for symbols `size_t` and `off_t`

    The two issues with the previous approach were that:

    1. `check_symbol_exists` would store "1" or "" into
       variable `off_t` rather than string "off_t", and

    2. (`check_symbol_exists` would not find `off_t` or
       `size_t` on modern Linux).

    Was reported with NetBSD 9.3.

    `size_t` is part of C99 (which Expat requires), so
    only the `off_t` half remains.

    Always provide path to find.

    Running find without path is a GNU extension.  GNU find uses current
    directory as starting-point in this case.  Better always use an
    explicit . in build scripts to support find on other systems.

    tests: Cover amplification tracking for isolated external parser

commit 1d50b80cf31de87750103656f6eb693746854aa8
Author: Sebastian Pipping <sebastian@pipping.org>
Date:   Mon Mar 4 23:49:06 2024 +0100

    lib/xmlparse.c: Detect billion laughs attack with isolated external parser

    When parsing DTD content with code like ..

      XML_Parser parser = XML_ParserCreate(NULL);
      XML_Parser ext_parser = XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate(parser, NULL, NULL);
      enum XML_Status status = XML_Parse(ext_parser, doc, (int)strlen(doc), XML_TRUE);

    .. there are 0 bytes accounted as direct input and all input from `doc` accounted
    as indirect input.  Now function accountingGetCurrentAmplification cannot calculate
    the current amplification ratio as "(direct + indirect) / direct", and it did refuse
    to divide by 0 as one would expect, but it returned 1.0 for this case to indicate
    no amplification over direct input.  As a result, billion laughs attacks from
    DTD-only input were not detected with this isolated way of using an external parser.

    The new approach is to assume direct input of length not 0 but 22 -- derived from
    ghost input "<!ENTITY a SYSTEM 'b'>", the shortest possible way to include an external
    DTD --, and do the usual "(direct + indirect) / direct" math with "direct := 22".

    GitHub issue #839 has more details on this issue and its origin in ClusterFuzz
    finding 66812.

    tests: Replace clock counting with scanned bytes in linear-time test

    This removes the dependency on CLOCKS_PER_SEC that prevented this test
    from running properly on some platforms, as well as the inherent
    flakiness of time measurements.

    Since later commits have introduced g_bytesScanned (and before that,
    g_parseAttempts), we can use that value as a proxy for parse time
    instead of clock().

    tests: Replace g_parseAttempts with g_bytesScanned

    This was used to estimate the number of scanned bytes. Just exposing
    that number directly will be more precise.

    tests: Check heuristic bypass with varying buffer fill sizes

    The bypass works on the assumption that the application uses a
    consistent fill size. Let's make some assertions about what should
    happen when the application doesn't do that -- most importantly,
    that parsing does happen eventually, and that the number of scanned
    bytes doesn't explode.

    tests: Make it clear to clang-tidy that assert_true may not return

    The key is to have __attribute__((noreturn)) somewhere that clang-tidy
    can see it. In this case, this is the _fail() function, which is
    conditionally called from the assert_true() macro.

    This will ensure that clang-tidy doesn't complain about NULL values
    that we've asserted against in tests.

    Bypass partial token heuristic when nearing full buffer

    ...instead of only when approaching the maximum buffer size INT/2+1.

    We'd like to give applications a chance to finish parsing a large token
    before buffer reallocation, in case the reallocation fails.

    By bypassing the reparse deferral heuristic when getting close to the
    filling the buffer, we give them this chance -- if the whole token is
    present in the buffer, it will be parsed at that time.

    This may come at the cost of some extra reparse attempts. For a token
    of n bytes, these extra parses cause us to scan over a maximum of
    2n bytes (... + n/8 + n/4 + n/2 + n). Therefore, parsing of big tokens
    remains O(n) in regard how many bytes we scan in attempts to parse. The
    cost in reality is lower than that, since the reparses that happen due
    to the bypass will affect m_partialTokenBytesBefore, delaying the next
    ratio-based reparse. Furthermore, only the first token that "breaks
    through" a buffer ceiling takes that extra reparse attempt; subsequent
    large tokens will only bypass the heuristic if they manage to hit the
    new buffer ceiling.

    Note that this cost analysis depends on the assumption that Expat grows
    its buffer by doubling it (or, more generally, grows it exponentially).
    If this changes, the cost of this bypass may increase. Hopefully, this
    would be caught by test_big_tokens_take_linear_time or the new test.

    The bypass logic assumes that the application uses a consistent fill.
    If the app increases its fill size, it may miss the bypass (and the
    normal heuristic will apply). If the app decreases its fill size, the
    bypass may be hit multiple times for the same buffer size. The very
    worst case would be to always fill half of the remaining buffer space,
    in which case parsing of a large n-byte token becomes O(n log n).

    As an added bonus, the new test case should be faster than the old one,
    since it doesn't have to go all the way to 1GiB to check the behavior.

    Finally, this change necessitated a small modification to two existing
    tests related to reparse deferral. These tests are testing the deferral
    enabled setting, and assume that reparsing will not happen for any other
    reason. By pre-growing the buffer, we make sure that this new deferral
    does not affect those test cases.

    Bypass partial token heuristic when close to maximum buffer size

    For huge tokens, we may end up in a situation where the partial token
    parse deferral heuristic demands more bytes than Expat's maximum buffer
    size (currently ~half of INT_MAX) could fit.

    INT_MAX/2 is 1024 MiB on most systems. Clearly, a token of 950 MiB could
    fit in that buffer, but the reparse threshold might be such that
    callProcessor() will defer it, allowing the app to keep filling the
    buffer until XML_GetBuffer() eventually returns a memory error.

    By bypassing the heuristic when we're getting close to the maximum
    buffer size, it will once again be possible to parse tokens in the size
    range INT_MAX/2/ratio < size < INT_MAX/2 reliably.

    We subtract the last buffer fill size as a way to detect that the next
    XML_GetBuffer() call has a risk of returning a memory error -- assuming
    that the application is likely to keep using the same (or smaller) fill.

    We subtract XML_CONTEXT_BYTES because that's the maximum amount of bytes
    that could remain at the start of the buffer, preceding the partial
    token. Technically, it could be fewer bytes, but XML_CONTEXT_BYTES is
    normally small relative to INT_MAX, and is much simpler to use.

    Don't update partial token heuristic on error

    Skip parsing after repeated partials on the same token

    When the parse buffer contains the starting bytes of a token but not
    all of them, we cannot parse the token to completion. We call this a
    partial token.  When this happens, the parse position is reset to the
    start of the token, and the parse() call returns. The client is then
    expected to provide more data and call parse() again.

    In extreme cases, this means that the bytes of a token may be parsed
    many times: once for every buffer refill required before the full token
    is present in the buffer.

    Math:
      Assume there's a token of T bytes
      Assume the client fills the buffer in chunks of X bytes
      We'll try to parse X, 2X, 3X, 4X ... until mX == T (technically >=)
      That's (m¬≤+m)X/2 = (T¬≤/X+T)/2 bytes parsed (arithmetic progression)
      While it is alleviated by larger refills, this amounts to O(T¬≤)

    Expat grows its internal buffer by doubling it when necessary, but has
    no way to inform the client about how much space is available. Instead,
    we add a heuristic that skips parsing when we've repeatedly stopped on
    an incomplete token. Specifically:

     * Only try to parse if we have a certain amount of data buffered
     * Every time we stop on an incomplete token, double the threshold
     * As soon as any token completes, the threshold is reset

    This means that when we get stuck on an incomplete token, the threshold
    grows exponentially, effectively making the client perform larger buffer
    fills, limiting how many times we can end up re-parsing the same bytes.

    Math:
      Assume there's a token of T bytes
      Assume the client fills the buffer in chunks of X bytes
      We'll try to parse X, 2X, 4X, 8X ... until (2^k)X == T (or larger)
      That's (2^(k+1)-1)X bytes parsed -- e.g. 15X if T = 8X
      This is equal to 2T-X, which amounts to O(T)

    We could've chosen a faster growth rate, e.g. 4 or 8. Those seem to
    increase performance further, at the cost of further increasing the
    risk of growing the buffer more than necessary. This can easily be
    adjusted in the future, if desired.

    This is all completely transparent to the client, except for:
    1. possible delay of some callbacks (when our heuristic overshoots)
    2. apps that never do isFinal=XML_TRUE could miss data at the end

    For the affected testdata, this change shows a 100-400x speedup.
    The recset.xml benchmark shows no clear change either way.

    When the parser is suspended, _XML_Parse_SINGLE_BYTES() will return
    early. At that point, there could be some amount of bytes that haven't
    been fed into Expat at all yet. This leaves us with an incomplete
    document.

    Furthermore, the last internal XML_Parse() call with isFinal=XML_TRUE
    will not have happened, so the parser will not know that no more input
    is to be expected. This is what allowed the test to pass when it was
    originally changed to use SINGLE_BYTES.

    With the new partial token heuristic, the lack of a final parse call
    means that we don't even reach the "Ho" text, and fail the test.

    The simplest solution is to go back to using XML_Parse() in this test.
    Another option would be to let SINGLE_BYTES expose how far it got in
    its loop, allowing for later continuation, but it doesn't seem worth the
    extra complexity.

    Add aaaaaa_*.xml with unreasonably large tokens

    Some of these currently take a very long time to parse. I set those to
    only run one loop in the run-benchmark make target.

    4096 may be a fairly small buffer, and definitely make the problem worse
    than it otherwise would've been, but similar sizes exist in real code:

     * 2048 bytes in cpython Modules/pyexpat.c
     * 4096 bytes in skia SkXMLParser.cpp
     * BUFSIZ bytes (8192 on my machine) in expat/examples

    The files, too, are inspired by real-life examples: Android stores
    depth and gain maps as base64-encoded JPEGs inside the XMP data of
    other JPEGs. Sometimes as a text element, sometimes as an attribute
    value. I've seen attribute values slightly over 5 MiB in size.
