- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication within the httpd service of TP-Link TL-WR902AC routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The httpd service listens on TCP port 80 and does not properly authenticate requests, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can disclose stored credentials from the router, potentially leading to further compromise of the device or network.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be within the same network segment as the vulnerable device and do not need any prior authentication.
