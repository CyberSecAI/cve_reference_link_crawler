CVE-2024-9436:

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of `add_query_arg` without proper output escaping, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious web scripts into page URLs.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute when a user interacts with the crafted link, potentially leading to actions being performed on behalf of the victim.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through a crafted URL. An unauthenticated attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on a link containing the malicious script.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker doesn't require any specific capabilities other than the ability to create a URL containing malicious JavaScript, and to convince the victim to visit it.
