- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of a check within the Zephyr OS DFU (Device Firmware Update) subsystem. Specifically, there is no verification to prevent the retrieval of the unencrypted firmware image from slot 0 of the device to the host. This occurs when using encrypted images, as slot 0 is unencrypted.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a check to determine if slot 0 is being uploaded from the device to the host using DFU over USB. This results in an information disclosure vulnerability (CWE-200).

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve the unencrypted firmware image, even if the firmware is intended to be encrypted. This allows access to the device's entire firmware code and potentially sensitive data.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent. An attacker needs to be in the local vicinity, likely using a device with a USB connection.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have physical access to the device and be able to interact with it via USB to use the `dfu-util` tool or similar tool. No special privileges or user interaction is required.

- **Additional details:**
    - The vulnerability exists in Zephyr versions prior to v3.0.
    - The provided example uses `dfu-util` to upload the unencrypted firmware (slot0.bin) to the host, which can be retrieved easily using the tool.
    - The vulnerability is triggered during the Device Firmware Update (DFU) process over USB.
    - The issue was fixed by adding a check to prevent retrieval of unencrypted firmware in pull request #42424, included in Zephyr v3.0 and later.
    - The CVSS score is 6.5/10, with high confidentiality impact.
    - The attack complexity is low, no privileges are required, and no user interaction is needed.
