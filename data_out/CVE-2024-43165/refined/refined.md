Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress WPSection plugin is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). This means the plugin allows an attacker to include local files from the target website, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to control which file is included, thereby bypassing intended access restrictions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially include local files such as configuration files that might contain database credentials, leading to a complete database takeover and wider compromise of the website and associated data. The vulnerability can lead to information disclosure by displaying output from local files on the screen.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality, which is vulnerable to LFI.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have Contributor-level privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
