We apologize for this awkward situation with the latest MasterStudy Theme update. Hence we have recently released the **hot-fix** with the MasterStudy LMS plugin.

On the contrary, if you have already updated the MasterStudy Theme and **have gotten a fatal error** on your website, please follow the steps below:

2. Download the **masterstudy.zip** archive on your Envato profile page.
5. Unzip the **masterstudy.zip** file which will give a Masterstudy folder. Make sure your unzipping software/tool does not create an extra directory with the same name nested into each other.
8. Retrieve your FTP login information from your hosting admin panel. Login to your FTP account via FTP software (as an example, FileZilla any other one) or File Manager tool in Cpanel to access your website folders.
11. Once you access the FTP account, navigate to the WordPress theme directory ***YOUR\_HOSTING\_ROOT/YOUR\_SUBDIRECTORY/wp-content/themes*** and remove the **masterstudy** folder.
14. Upload the previously unzipped masterstudy folder into ***YOUR\_HOSTING\_ROOT/YOUR\_SUBDIRECTORY/wp-content/themes*** directory.

Once again, our deepest apologies for the inconvenience. We assure to take steps to ensure that this kind of situation does not repeat anymore.

### Description

The MasterStudy LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1. This is due to insufficient validation checks within the \_register\_user() function called by the 'wp\_ajax\_nopriv\_stm\_lms\_register' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register a user with administrator-level privileges when MasterStudy LMS Pro is installed and the LMS Forms Editor add-on is enabled.
