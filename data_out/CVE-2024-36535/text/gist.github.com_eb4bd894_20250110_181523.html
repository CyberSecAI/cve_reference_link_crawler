|  | [Description]: |
| --- | --- |
|  | Insecure permissions in meshery v0.7.51 and earlier versions allows attackers to access sensitive data and escalate privileges by obtaining the service account's token. |
|  |  |
|  | [Vulnerability Type]: |
|  | Incorrect Access Control |
|  |  |
|  | [Vendor of Product]: |
|  | https://github.com/meshery/meshery |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Product Code Base]: |
|  | meshery - <= v0.7.51 |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Component]: |
|  | Directly compromise all Secrets components in k8s, further compromise other components in the cluster or even take over the entire kubernetes cluster. |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Vectors]: |
|  | 1. the attacker stole the token. |
|  | Here is an example of stealing a token：in cncf, there is a project named hwameistor, and the DaemonSet hwameistor-local-disk-manager for that project has a cluster role named hwameistor-admin, which has the `update/patch` verb of `nodes` resource.If a malicious user takes control of a worker node, by default the "hwameistor-local-disk-manager" pod will run on that node and he/she can use that pod to patch/update other nodes and force meshery’s pod to run on the malicious worker node. Then, he/she can stole the token. |
|  | 2. Use the obtained token information to authenticate with the API Server. By including the token in the request, attacker can be recognized as a legitimate user with the ServiceAccount and gain all privileges associated with the ServiceAccount. |
|  | 3. Use the privileges to access all Secrets in the cluster. |
|  | 4. Use the sensitive information in the Secrets to elevate privileges and explore other sensitive resources, and eventually take over the entire cluster. |
