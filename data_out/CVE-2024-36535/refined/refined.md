The provided content is relevant to CVE-2024-36535.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insecure permissions in Meshery v0.7.51 and earlier versions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Incorrect Access Control. The service account used by Meshery has excessive privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can access sensitive data, escalate privileges, and potentially take over the entire Kubernetes cluster. This includes accessing all secrets within the cluster.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  Stealing the service account token. An example involves exploiting the `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` DaemonSet, which has update/patch permissions on nodes, to force Meshery pods to run on a compromised node.
2.  Using the stolen token to authenticate with the API server, gaining the same privileges as the service account.
3.  Accessing all Secrets in the cluster using the compromised service account.
4.  Leveraging the information from Secrets to elevate privileges further and compromise other sensitive resources within the cluster.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to gain control of a worker node in the Kubernetes cluster. From there, they can exploit the excessive permissions granted to the `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` DaemonSet to force meshery's pods to run on their node and steal the service account's token.
