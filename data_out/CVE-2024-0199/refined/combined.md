# GitLab Security Release: 16.9.2, 16.8.4, 16.7.7

Learn more about GitLab Security Release: 16.9.2, 16.8.4, 16.7.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Today we are releasing versions 16.9.2, 16.8.4, 16.7.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to
one of these versions immediately. GitLab.com is already running the patched version.

GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases:
a monthly, scheduled security release, released a week after the feature release (which deploys on the 3rd Thursday of each month),
and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. For more information, you can visit our [security FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/).
You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts [here](/releases/categories/releases/).
In addition, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=closed&label_name%5B%5D=bug%3A%3Avulnerability&confidential=no&first_page_size=100)
30 days after the release in which they were patched.

We are dedicated to ensuring all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to
the highest security standards. As part of maintaining good security hygiene, it is highly recommended that all customers
upgrade to the latest security release for their supported version. You can read more
[best practices in securing your GitLab instance](/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/) in our blog post.

### Recommended Action

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are **upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible**.

When no specific deployment type (omnibus, source code, helm chart, etc.) of a product is mentioned, this means all types are affected.

## Table of fixes

| Title | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| [Bypassing CODEOWNERS approval allowing to steal protected variables](#bypassing-codeowners-approval-allowing-to-steal-protected-variables) | High |
| [Guest with manage group access tokens can rotate and see group access token with owner permissions](#guest-with-manage-group-access-tokens-can-rotate-and-see-group-access-token-with-owner-permissions) | Medium |

### Bypassing CODEOWNERS approval allowing to steal protected variables

An authorization bypass vulnerability was discovered in GitLab affecting versions 11.3 prior to 16.7.7, 16.7.6 prior to 16.8.4, and 16.8.3 prior to 16.9.2. An attacker could bypass CODEOWNERS by utilizing a crafted payload in an old feature branch to perform malicious actions.
This is a high severity issue (`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N`, 7.7).
It is now mitigated in the latest release and is assigned [CVE-2024-0199](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0199).

Thanks [ali\_shehab](https://hackerone.com/ali_shehab) for reporting this vulnerability through our HackerOne bug bounty program.

### Guest with manage group access tokens can rotate and see group access token with owner permissions

A privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in GitLab affecting versions 16.8 prior to 16.8.4 and 16.9 prior to 16.9.2. It was possible for a user with custom role of `manage_group_access_tokens` to rotate group access tokens with owner privileges.
This is a medium severity issue (`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`, 6.5).
It is now mitigated in the latest release and is assigned [CVE-2024-1299](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1299).

Thanks [ashish\_r\_padelkar](https://hackerone.com/ashish_r_padelkar) for reporting this vulnerability through our HackerOne bug bounty program.

# Bypassing CODEOWNERS approval allowing to steal protected variables

⚠ **Please read [the process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/security/developer.md) on how to fix security issues before starting to work on the issue. Vulnerabilities must be fixed in a security mirror.**

**[HackerOne report #2295423](https://hackerone.com/reports/2295423)** by `ali_shehab` on 2023-12-22, assigned to `GitLab Team`:

## Report

##### Summary

Hi team hope you are well. There is something weird happening, that allows me to bypass CODEOWNERS approval of a file. This done by creating a branch through a merge request`ali` -> `main` and approve the mr by the CODEOWNER then deleting `ali` branch, creating branch `ali2` and add evil code to it, and create mr. Now create `ali` from `ali2` . Go back to the first mr, reopen and merge you will see that evil code was added although it was not approved.

##### Steps to reproduce

**As an owner:**

1. Create a new group and apply the ultimate trial to it
2. Create a new project in that group
3. Create a `CODEOWNERS` file with the following content

```
[Code Owners]
* [@]OWNER_USERNAME
```

4. Navigate to <https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/settings/repository>, and do the following for the `main` branch:
   * Toggle on code owner approval
   * Allow developers and maintainers to merge
5. Invite a developer to the group

**As the developer:**

6. Create a new branch, add any change to any file, and create an MR from that branch to `main` - let's call that branch `test-1`

**As the owner:**

7. Approve that MR (the owner sees the changes, they're all safe and can be merged)

**As the developer:**

8. Delete `test-1` branch
9. Create a new branch call it `test-2`, and add "evil" code to the repository, create an MR with that change
10. Create a new branch called `test-1` from `test-2`
11. Navigate back to the MR approved by the owner, and open the mr and merge
12. Refresh the page, and verify that you can merge the MR
13. Merge that MR, and verify that the second MR (created in step 9) is also merged
14. Verify that the merged change is that introduced in the second MR which the owner didn't approve

Able to bypass codeowners approval which can lead to pass and evil code and steal protected enviroment.
