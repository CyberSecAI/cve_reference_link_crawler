- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Graphina plugin for WordPress, in versions 1.8.10 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts would execute when visitors access the site.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious scripts are injected into the website, and then executed on the client-side when a user visits the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script, which could be through a vulnerability in the plugin's handling of user input, or by compromising a user account with contributor permissions. The content states that a 'contributor' privilege is required.
