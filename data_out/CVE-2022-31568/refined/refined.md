Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information concerning the identified CVEs:

**General Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary root cause across all listed CVEs is the unsafe usage of the Flask `send_file` function, which allows for absolute path traversal.
*   **Weakness:**  The vulnerability lies in the application's failure to sanitize or validate user-supplied input when constructing file paths, leading to CWE-22 (Path Traversal).
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive information like source code, configuration files, credentials, or even system files. This is a critical confidentiality risk.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attacks. An attacker can send malicious requests to the vulnerable endpoint, with a crafted path that will cause the server to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Required Capabilities:** No specific privileges or user interaction are required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker only needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application.

**CVE Specific Details:**

**Additional Notes from GHSA-669 discussion:**

*   The vulnerability is consistently related to the usage of Flask's `send_file` function with unsanitized input
*   Some discussion indicated that `os.path.join` is also used incorrectly and is not safe for constructing paths
*   The discussion indicated that the issue was found using CodeQL by GitHub.
*   A discussion on the GHSA issue mentioned that the vulnerability is an absolute path traversal issue due to incorrect use of `send_file` function in flask. This also included an example of the exploit using curl.
*   Some maintainers may have used `flask.safe_join` or `flask.send_from_directory` to fix the issue, while some maintainers didn't fix the issue.
*   Several CVEs were assigned to repositories that were not considered widely used or not well maintained.
*   A comment from one of the participants indicated that the tool they used to find vulnerabilities, such as OWASP dependency-check, is only as good as the data it uses.
*   There is some discussion on the proper way of reporting a vulnerability to the maintainer.

**Recommendations for Mitigation (from GHSA-669):**

*   **Avoid using `send_file` with untrusted input:** The use of untrusted parameters with `send_file` is the main source of this vulnerability.
*  **Use `flask.safe_join` for building paths:** If input from users need to be used in path generation, `flask.safe_join` should be used.
*  **Use `flask.send_from_directory` instead:** Whenever possible, use `send_from_directory`, it handles path traversal automatically.

**Conclusion**
The core vulnerability is related to a coding pattern where user controlled input is being passed to Flaskâ€™s `send_file` without prior sanitization or validation. This can easily lead to arbitrary file access.
It's also important to note that most of the vulnerable repositories appear to be projects that are either personal, academic or otherwise unmaintained. This could increase the risk as a patch may not be forthcoming.
