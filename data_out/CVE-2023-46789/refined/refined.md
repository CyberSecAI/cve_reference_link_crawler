Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `functions.php` resource where the 'filename' attribute of the 'pic1' multipart parameter is not validated. The system directly uses the uploaded filename in a SQL query without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization before using user-supplied data in SQL queries. Specifically, the `$_FILES['pic1']['name']` (and similarly for pic2, pic3, pic4) is directly incorporated into the SQL query.
- **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user, meaning no login or prior access to the system is required to carry out an attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query through the filename to potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, steal sensitive information (like user credentials, personal details), or even drop tables causing complete data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Multipart Form Parameter:** The attack vector is through the 'pic1' (and pic2, pic3, pic4) file upload parameter in a multipart form, where a malicious SQL statement is injected within the filename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `functions.php` script.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to be logged into the application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet:
```php
$pic1=($_FILES['pic1']['name']);
$pic2=($_FILES['pic2']['name']);
$pic3=($_FILES['pic3']['name']);
$pic4=($_FILES['pic4']['name']);
...
if(mysqli_num_rows($result) == 0) {
    $sql="INSERT INTO photos (id, cust_id, pic1, pic2, pic3, pic4) VALUES ('', '$id', '$pic1' ,'$pic2', '$pic3','$pic4')";
    mysqlexec($sql);
} else {
    $sql="UPDATE photos SET pic1 = '$pic1', pic2 = '$pic2', pic3 = '$pic3', pic4 = '$pic4' WHERE cust_id=$id";
    mysqlexec($sql);
}
```
- The attacker can craft a filename like `' OR 1=1; -- ` which, when inserted into the SQL query, can bypass intended logic.
