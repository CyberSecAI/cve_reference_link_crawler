- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the failure of the backend to effectively validate user input in the `EventEditor.php` component. An attacker can insert malicious SQL code through the `EventCount` POST parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user input allowing the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    - Spoof identity.
    - Tamper with existing data.
    - Cause repudiation issues (e.g., voiding transactions, changing balances).
    - Disclose all data on the system.
    - Destroy the data or make it unavailable.
    - Become administrators of the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `EventCount` POST parameter in the `/EventEditor.php` page. The attacker needs to create an event, then navigate to the edit page and intercept the request to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the ChurchCRM application, be able to create and edit events, and be able to intercept HTTP requests (e.g. using a tool like Burp Suite) to modify the POST parameters sent to the server.
