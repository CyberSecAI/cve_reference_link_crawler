We’re thrilled to announce the release of **KeePassXC version 2.7.7**. This update brings several exciting features and enhancements that will improve your workflow and integration with modern authentication services. Let’s dive into the major highlights:

## Passkeys Support

This release delivers the official implementation of Passkeys for KeePassXC! This feature is a year in the making and uses the existing browser integration service to both store and use Passkeys for authentication. A special thank you to [Ortham](https://github.com/Ortham) for providing an extremely comprehensive standards, security, and privacy review of our implementation prior to release. If you haven’t heard of Passkeys yet, they are an alternative to passwords that are incredibly secure and privacy preserving. Read more [about Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) and also [read our documentation](/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide.html#_passkeys).

 in  *Releases*

Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.6** with a few bug fixes and enhancements. This version fixes a crash on
macOS that occurred on exit. We also improved the visual display when dragging entries to move/copy, Quick Unlock
is now automatically activated when unlocking for Auto-Type or Browser access, and the Auto-Type button and shortcut
key will be disabled when Auto-Type is turned off for the entry or group.

## [Discussion on CVE-2023–35866](https://keepassxc.org/blog/2023-06-20-cve-202335866/)

By  *Jonathan White*

Posted on
 20 June 2023, 10:00
 in  *Security*

On June 19, 2023 an alleged KeePassXC vulnerability with the identifier [CVE-2023–35866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-35866) was posted against KeePassXC versions up to 2.7.5. As the developers of KeePassXC, we do not consider the issue a vulnerability and have filed a request for the CVE to be rejected. Additional information can be found in the [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/9339).

The root of the argument submitted by the CVE author is that an attacker with unfettered access to an already unlocked database could export or change the password without requiring the original credentials. Where this is true, there are numerous barriers to actually executing this attack sequence. In addition, having lost control of your computer in this manner would mean the attacker could execute any number of security compromises against your KeePassXC database, regardless of requiring credentials prior to export or credential change.

At this time, we are not planning any drastic changes to the program to address this submission. We are also monitoring the request to reject/dispute this CVE on the grounds it is not actually a vulnerability in our software. Information on mitigation and other factors is included after
the break.

## [KeePassXC 2.7.5 released](https://keepassxc.org/blog/2023-05-14-2.7.5-released/)

By  *Jonathan White*

Posted on
 14 May 2023, 17:00
 in  *Releases*

Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.5** with a bunch of bug fixes and performance improvements. This version fixes
three separate crashes that were found with the support of our active community members. Additionally, we fixed several
areas in the code that were causing significant slow downs when databases had more than a thousand entries.

This release brings several popular feature requests including a menu option to temporarily allow screen capture (Windows & macOS),
an improved layout to the HTML export, improved KeePassXC logos and icons, and increasing the max TOTP step to 24 hours.

 in  *Security*

An audit of KeePassXC has been on the wish list since we started this project over six years ago. Today we are happy to announce the release
of an audit conducted by Zaur Molotnikov, an independent security consultant, that was completed on January 19, 2023 against KeePassXC 2.7.4.
This audit was conducted free of charge to the KeePassXC Team and the findings and writeup were reviewed for correctness.

## [KeePassXC 2.7.4 released](https://keepassxc.org/blog/2022-10-29-2.7.4-released/)

By  *Janek Bevendorff*

 in  *Releases*

Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.4**, the fourth maintenance update for the 2.7 stable series.

The release fixes several issues that appeared in the previous release concerning the browser integration and the
entry preview panel, as well as a compatibility problem with macOS 13 Ventura. In addition, we also improved
Unicode support on Windows and added a two-month password expiration preset.

## [KeePassXC 2.7.3 released](https://keepassxc.org/blog/2022-10-23-2.7.3-released/)

By  *Jonathan White*

Posted on
 23 October 2022, 22:00
 in  *Releases*

Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.3**, the third maintenance update for the 2.7 stable series.

This release introduces saved searches, enhanced tags support, improvements to the entry preview panel,
a `db-edit` command to the CLI, and corrects numerous bugs and crashes. We have also made several quality
of life improvements to the program such as tabbing around the interface and preventing focus locks. This
update also provides better handling of dark/light mode detection on macOS and Linux.

## [KeePassXC 2.7.1 released](https://keepassxc.org/blog/2022-04-06-2.7.1-released/)

By  *Janek Bevendorff*

Posted on
 6 April 2022, 20:50
 in  *Releases*

Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.1**, the first maintenance update for the 2.7 stable series.

The release fixes multiple issues with Auto-Type, performance problems with the legacy AES-KDF, and several other minor bugs. We also improved the entry preview panel layout and paved the way for first-class Flatpak support on Linux. Flatpak, thus far, has been a downstream third-party distribution, but with the new release, we upstreamed patches needed for building KeePassXC as a Flatpak, and it will eventually supersede Snap as our preferred Linux distribution channel. Our experience shows that Flatpak has been a more stable platform than Snap, which has had many deployment bugs over the years, so we decided to deprecate it in favour of Flatpak. If you are experiencing problems with the current Snap, we recommend you switch to one of our other two supported Linux packages or to Flatpak once we announce an official Flathub channel.

|  | 1. Get memory dump of KeePassXC (e.g. via Windows Taskmanager or virutalbox debugvm) |
| --- | --- |
|  | 2a. CVE-2024-33900 - get master password: string -e b <filename> | grep "YOUR MASTER PASSWORD" |
|  | 2b. CVE-2024-33901 - get stored password: string -e b <filename> | grep "YOUR STORED PASSWORD" |
|  |  |
|  | Note: Both attacks works every time when the database is open in KeePassXC. When the database is closed or locked the probability is 1 in 10 respectively 4 in 10. |
|  |  |
|  | Why does it work?: Don't really know :P But is the data is somewhere in the memory regions of the qt-framework as UTF-16 string. |
|  |  |
|  | This affects KeePassXC version 2.7.7. There is a high probablity, that other versions are also affected. |

## Description

![@StayPirate](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37073343?u=cfee333ec098c489b00eaf582edfd812a49c7723&v=4&size=48)[StayPirate](https://github.com/StayPirate)opened [on May 21, 2024](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/10784#issue-2307523005)

[CVE-2024-33900](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c45j-7735-f4r2 "CVE-2024-33900") and [CVE-2024-33901](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g437-xqhv-c7mq "CVE-2024-33901") have been assigned by Mitre to [this *highly professional* report](https://gist.github.com/Fastor01/30c6d89c842feb1865ec2cd2d3806838).

IMO being able to dump plaintext creds from the process memory, when the database is unlocked, is a normal behavior and not a bug. The reporter also mentions:

> When the database is closed or locked the probability is 1 in 10 respectively 4 in 10.

which indeed sounds weird.

*My following reasoning is purely hypothetical due to poor details shared by the reporter and me not having reproduced the bug.*

When the database gets locked, I expect there will be some allocated memory being freed. That memory might contain data from when the database was unlocked and should be zeroed before being released. Do you think that non-zeroed freed memory could be the cause?

# KeePassXC Memory Security

Some of you may have seen the [recent vulnerability report from ISE](https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/) that details various memory attacks against 1Password and KeePass, among others. Although KeePassXC was not mentioned, we have thoroughly reviewed the report and address some questions it raises below.

## How does KeePassXC protect my data?

Similar to KeePass, we protect all data “at rest” (that is, when it is saved in the password database file \*.kdbx). Aside from non-sensitive header data (such as initialization information for the encryption algorithms), your entire database (usernames, passwords, notes, etc) is encrypted using industry standard methods.

However, unlike KeePass, KeePassXC is a cross-platform application written in C++ using the Qt framework. We have worked very hard to be consistent across Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms in terms of user experience and security. Each of these operating systems have different methods of handling memory that must be taken into account. This is a very complex topic with a lot of nuance. The following is a succinct breakdown of our security across the three platforms.

Please Note: memory attacks are generally not possible unless an attacker has (physical) access to your machine or a malicious application is running. If your computer is compromised in this way, then there is very little a program can do to protect its data. Your best defense against this threat is to follow general digital hygiene, keeping your computer physically secure, and (maybe) having an up-to-date virus scanner. Nonetheless, here are the techniques KeePassXC uses to protect your data:

### Windows Memory Protection

KeePassXC uses modern Windows memory security techniques available to all processes. None of the other password managers featured in the ISE report have implemented this security. If they had, the ISE attacks would have failed outright! We specifically disable reading the memory of KeePassXC. (Note: it is not possible to prevent an administrator from accessing memory) We also disable “core dumps” which can expose secrets if the application crashes. Our memory protections can be readily tested by using [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) as shown in the following screenshots comparing KeePassXC to KeePass:

KeePassXC currently does not encrypt data in memory, but we do explicitly clear sensitive data from deleted data structures (so far as the operating system’s memory management allows). KeePassXC also cannot prevent data extraction from a hibernation file which stores your computer’s memory to disk when going to sleep.

### Linux Memory Protection

KeePassXC prevents the use of ptrace and generation of core dumps. This prevents anyone, except the root user, from accessing the memory of the process. Due to the significant variety in different Linux distributions, we encourage you to ensure their kernel is compiled and run with sufficient protections to process memory.

The [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/keepassxc) and [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.keepassxc.KeePassXC) distributions of KeePassXC run in their own sandbox (on Ubuntu) which significantly increases their memory security. The AppImage distribution can be further secured by running it in [FireJail](https://firejail.wordpress.com/). If you are concerned with memory attacks, we recommend using these distributions.

### MacOS Memory Protection

MacOS has similar protections to Linux: disabling the use of ptrace and core dumps. MacOS does have support for sandboxed applications, but KeePassXC currently does not take advantage of this. We are looking into this possibility for the future.

## How can we be more secure?

We are currently exploring these methods to enhance memory security:

* Use sandboxing on platforms where supported
* Investigate Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to encrypt/decrypt sensitive memory
* Investigate Intel SGX (encrypted memory enclaves); only available for Windows and Linux (unofficial)

## Details for the curious

Since KeePassXC is an open source application, we encourage everyone with the appropriate knowledge to review our code. The above memory protection techniques are all applied during the initial Bootstrap process before any data is loaded in to the application. You can see the code for this here: [src/core/Bootstrap.cpp#L45](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/blob/develop/src/core/Bootstrap.cpp#L45)
