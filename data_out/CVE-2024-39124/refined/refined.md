- **Defacement:** An attacker could modify the content of the page, redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being rendered as HTML in the help page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Inject Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to find a way to insert malicious JavaScript into the input that will be displayed via the vulnerable `classhelpers`. The specifics of how this input is injected are not detailed in this description.
