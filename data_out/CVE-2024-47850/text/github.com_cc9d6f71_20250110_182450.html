# cups-browsed can be made to endlessly spam HTTP requests to a chosen endpoint

## Package

cups-filters

## Affected versions

1.28.17-3 (Debian), 1.x 2076627 (git)

## Patched versions

None

## Description

**Update: There is now a separate CVE assigned to this advisory.**

**The solution (remove CUPS browsing) and quick mitigation (turn off CUPS browsing in `cups-browsed.conf`) are the same as for [CVE-2024-47176](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8), so the methods applied there also cover this one.**

**Mitigation:**

**1. Edit `/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf`

2. Search for the `BrowseRemoteProtocols` configuration option

3. Set the option to `dnssd` (the default value is `dnssd cups`, remove `cups`)

4. Restart cups-browsed using `sudo systemctl restart cups-browsed`**

### Summary

When cups-browsed, running with the default configuration (on Debian at least), receives a well-formed packet to UDP 631 containing the http port 80 URL of any popular website that just serves redirects on that port, it will send HTTP requests in a tight loop. This does not appear to stop until `kill -9`.

### Details

Example exploit:

```
printf '00 00 ipp://example.x:80/printers/ "XXlocation" "XXinfo" "XXmake-and-model"\n' | nc -u 192.0.2.1 631`

```

(example.x is not a real hostname; the IP is fake too; I have tried with a few web servers under my control to verify the behaviour)

### PoC

See Details.

### Impact

A client doing requests in a tight loop might impact availability of a server. Several such clients together might make it worse.

### Relevant details

I have confirmed this behaviour with a packet from an untrusted source over the Internet, in `cups-browsed` `1.28.17-3` as shipped in Debian 12.

I have also confirmed this behaviour with a packet from localhost in a fresh compile of <https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters> on branch `1.x` as of just now (commit [2076627](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/commit/2076627d33477212f21352ad39e9d305adb63af3))

### Additional context

I am aware of recent rumours around RCE in cups-browsed. Based on just public information, I decided to look at cups myself, and quickly noticed that cups-browsed listens to the world in at least some setups. That is how I found this problem.

I suspect, but in no way can currently prove, that the RCE rumours also involve this UDP socket. A lot of code is executed for a received packet that is well-formed.

It would not surprise me if the problem I am reporting here, that is not RCE, has also recently become known to you, either from `evilsocket` or from somebody else who recently felt inclined to audit parts of CUPS.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
