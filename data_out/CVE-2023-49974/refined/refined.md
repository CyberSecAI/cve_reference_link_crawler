  - Other malicious activities within the user's browser context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "contact" field/parameter on the customer creation or editing pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the application as an authenticated user who has permissions to edit or create customers.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `</dt></b><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` demonstrates a simple XSS injection.
- The vulnerability is present in the `customer_list` page, where the unsanitized data is displayed.
- The affected version of the application is Customer Support System 1.0.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the page `/customer_support/index.php?page=customer_list` is visited by any user.
