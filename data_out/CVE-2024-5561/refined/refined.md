- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the vulnerable plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** A high privilege user, such as an administrator, can insert the malicious payload within the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to edit the plugin's settings. The vulnerability can be exploited even if the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, such as in multisite setups.
