Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-28439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how CKEditor 4 handles the destruction of editor instances, specifically when using the "Iframe Dialog" and "Media Embed" plugins with specific configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- Improper handling of editor instance destruction: The vulnerability is triggered during the process of destroying a CKEditor instance.
- **Specific Plugin Dependency:**  The vulnerability requires the presence of the "Iframe Dialog" or "Media Embed" plugins.
- **Non-`<textarea>` Base Element:** It also depends on the editor being initialized on an element other than a `<textarea>`.
- **Lack of Content Security Policy:** The exploit is possible on web pages with missing or misconfigured Content Security Policy (CSP).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **JavaScript Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- **Compromise User Sessions:** This can be used to perform various malicious actions such as stealing cookies/session information, redirecting users to malicious sites or modifying page content.
- **Full control over vulnerable web page:** The attacker can take full control over the vulnerable web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the editor instance destruction process.
- The attacker does not require any direct access to the server. 
- Attackers can potentially leverage any input that results in dynamically destroying and initializing a CKEditor instance with the specified conditions on a webpage

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Target Configuration Knowledge:** The attacker must be aware of a web application using vulnerable versions of CKEditor 4 along with "Iframe Dialog" or "Media Embed" plugins, using an element other than `<textarea>`, and without a proper CSP implementation.
- **Trigger Editor Destruction:** They must be able to trigger the destruction of the CKEditor instance.
- No special access to the server is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is considered low severity.
- The vulnerability impacts versions of CKEditor 4 prior to 4.21.0.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 4.21.0 of CKEditor 4.
- The patch includes default `sandbox` attributes for iframes within the Iframe Dialog plugin and ensures that the Media Embed plugin regenerates the content of the widget. These new behaviours can be configured via config.iframe_attributes and config.embed_keepOriginalContent respectively.
- It's noted that the vulnerability may only affect a small percentage of integrators using dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanisms.
