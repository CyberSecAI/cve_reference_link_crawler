# Kubernetes users may update Pod labels to bypass network policy

Moderate

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-gj2r-phwg-6rww
Sep 26, 2023

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

<=1.13.6
<=1.14.1
<=1.12.13

## Patched versions

1.13.7
1.14.2
1.12.14

## Description

### Impact

An attacker with the ability to update pod labels can cause Cilium to apply incorrect network policies.

This issue arises due to the fact that on pod update, Cilium incorrectly uses user-provided pod labels to select the policies which apply to the workload in question.

This can affect:

* Cilium network policies that use the namespace, service account or cluster constructs to restrict traffic
* Cilium clusterwide network policies that use Cilium namespace labels to select the Pod
* Kubernetes network policies

Non-existent construct names can be provided, which bypass all network policies applicable to the construct. For example, providing a pod with a non-existent namespace as the value of the `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` label results in none of the namespaced CiliumNetworkPolicies applying to the pod in question.

This attack requires the attacker to have [Kubernetes API Server access](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/threat-model/#kubernetes-api-server-attacker), as described in the Cilium Threat Model.

### Patches

This issue affects:

* Cilium <= v1.14.1
* Cilium <= v1.13.6
* Cilium <= v1.12.13

This issue has been resolved in:

* Cilium v1.14.2
* Cilium v1.13.7
* Cilium v1.12.14

### Workarounds

An admission webhook can be used to prevent pod label updates to the `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` and `io.cilium.k8s.policy.*` keys.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Palantir and Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to [@odinuge](https://github.com/odinuge) for reporting this issue and to [@nebril](https://github.com/nebril) for the fix.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
