# Threat Model[](#threat-model "Permalink to this heading")

This section presents a threat model for Cilium. This threat model
allows interested parties to understand:

* security-specific implications of Cilium’s architecture
* controls that are in place to secure data flowing through Cilium’s various components
* recommended controls for running Cilium in a production environment

## Scope and Prerequisites[](#scope-and-prerequisites "Permalink to this heading")

This threat model considers the possible attacks that could affect an
up-to-date version of Cilium running in a production environment; it
will be refreshed when there are significant changes to Cilium’s
architecture or security posture.

This model does not consider supply-chain attacks, such as attacks where
a malicious contributor is able to intentionally inject vulnerable code
into Cilium. For users who are concerned about supply-chain attacks,
Cilium’s [security audit](https://github.com/cilium/cilium.io/blob/main/Security-Reports/CiliumSecurityAudit2022.pdf) assessed Cilium’s supply chain controls
against [the SLSA framework](https://slsa.dev/).

In order to understand the following threat model, readers will need
familiarity with basic Kubernetes concepts, as well as a high-level
understanding of Cilium’s [architecture and components](../../overview/component-overview/#component-overview).

## Methodology[](#methodology "Permalink to this heading")

This threat model considers eight different types of threat
actors, placed at different parts of a typical deployment stack. We will
primarily use Kubernetes as an example but the threat model remains
accurate if deployed with other orchestration systems, or when running
Cilium outside of Kubernetes. The attackers will have different levels
of initial privileges, giving us a broad overview of the security
guarantees that Cilium can provide depending on the nature of the threat
and the extent of a previous compromise.

For each threat actor, this guide uses the [the STRIDE methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_%28security%29) to
assess likely attacks. Where one attack type in the STRIDE set can lead to others
(for example, tampering leading to denial of service), we have described the
attack path under the most impactful attack type. For the potential attacks
that we identify, we recommend controls that can be used to reduce the
risk of the identified attacks compromising a cluster. Applying the
recommended controls is strongly advised in order to run Cilium securely
in production.

## Reference Architecture[](#reference-architecture "Permalink to this heading")

For ease of understanding, consider a single Kubernetes
cluster running Cilium, as illustrated below:

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_reference_architecture.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_reference_architecture.png)
## The Threat Model[](#the-threat-model "Permalink to this heading")

For each type of attacker, we consider the plausible types of attacks
available to them, how Cilium can be used to protect against these
attacks, as well as the security controls that Cilium provides. For
attacks which might arise as a consequence of the high level of
privileges required by Cilium, we also suggest mitigations that users
should apply to secure their environments.

### Kubernetes Workload Attacker[](#kubernetes-workload-attacker "Permalink to this heading")

For the first scenario, consider an attacker who has been able to
gain access to a Kubernetes pod, and is now able to run arbitrary code
inside a container. This could occur, for example, if a vulnerable
service is exposed externally to a network. In this case, let us also
assume that the compromised pod does not have any elevated privileges
(in Kubernetes or on the host) or direct access to host files.

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_workload.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_workload.png)
### Limited-privilege Host Attacker[](#limited-privilege-host-attacker "Permalink to this heading")

In this scenario, the attacker is someone with the ability to run
arbitrary code with direct access to the host PID or network namespace
(or both), but without “root” privileges that would allow them to
disable Cilium components or undermine the eBPF and other kernel state
Cilium relies on.

This level of access could exist for a variety of reasons, including:

* Pods or other containers running in the host PID or network
  namespace, but not with “root” privileges. This includes
  `hostNetwork: true` and `hostPID: true` containers.
* Non-“root” SSH or other console access to a node.
* A containerized workload that has “escaped” the container namespace
  but as a non-privileged user.

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_non_privileged.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_non_privileged.png)
### Root-equivalent Host Attacker[](#root-equivalent-host-attacker "Permalink to this heading")

A “root” privilege host attacker has full privileges to do everything on
the local host. This access could exist for several reasons, including:

* Root SSH or other console access to the Kubernetes worker node.
* A containerized workload that has escaped the container namespace as
  a privileged user.
* Pods running with `privileged: true` or other significant
  capabilities like `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or `CAP_BPF`.

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_root.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_root.png)
### Man-in-the-middle Attacker[](#man-in-the-middle-attacker "Permalink to this heading")

In this scenario, our attacker has access to the underlying network
between Kubernetes worker nodes, but not the Kubernetes worker nodes
themselves. This attacker may inspect, modify, or inject malicious
network traffic.

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_mitm.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_mitm.png)
### Network Attacker[](#network-attacker "Permalink to this heading")

In our threat model, a generic network attacker has access to the same
underlying IP network as Kubernetes worker nodes, but is not inline
between the nodes. The assumption is that this attacker is still able to
send IP layer traffic that reaches a Kubernetes worker node. This is a
weaker variant of the man-in-the-middle attack described above, as the
attacker can only inject traffic to worker nodes, but not see the
replies.

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_network_attacker.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_network_attacker.png)
### Kubernetes API Server Attacker[](#kubernetes-api-server-attacker "Permalink to this heading")

This type of attack could be carried out by any user or code with
network access to the Kubernetes API server and credentials that allow
Kubernetes API requests. Such permissions would allow the user to read
or manipulate the API server state (for example by changing CRDs).

This section is intended to cover any attack that might be exposed via
Kubernetes API server access, regardless of whether the access is full or
limited.

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_api_server_attacker.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_api_server_attacker.png)
### Cilium Key-value Store Attacker[](#cilium-key-value-store-attacker "Permalink to this heading")

Cilium can use [an external key-value store](../../installation/k8s-install-external-etcd/#k8s-install-etcd)
such as etcd to store state. In this scenario, we consider a user with
network access to the Cilium etcd endpoints and credentials to access
those etcd endpoints. The credentials to the etcd endpoints are stored
as Kubernetes secrets; any attacker would first have to compromise these
secrets before gaining access to the key-value store.

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_etcd_attacker.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_etcd_attacker.png)
### Hubble Data Attacker[](#hubble-data-attacker "Permalink to this heading")

This is an attacker with network reachability to Kubernetes worker
nodes, or other systems that store or expose Hubble data, with the goal
of gaining access to potentially sensitive Hubble flow or process data.

![../../_images/cilium_threat_model_hubble_attacker.png](../../_images/cilium_threat_model_hubble_attacker.png)

## Overall Recommendations[](#overall-recommendations "Permalink to this heading")

To summarize the recommended controls to be used when configuring a
production Kubernetes cluster with Cilium:

1. Ensure that Kubernetes roles are scoped correctly to the requirements of your
   users, and that service account permissions for pods are tightly scoped to
   the needs of the workloads. In particular, access to sensitive namespaces,
   `exec` actions, and Kubernetes secrets should all be highly controlled.
2. Use resource limits for workloads where possible to reduce the chance of
   denial of service attacks.
3. Ensure that workload privileges and capabilities are only granted when
   essential to the functionality of the workload, and ensure that specific
   controls to limit and monitor the behavior of the workload are in place.
4. Use [network policies](../policy/#network-policy) to ensure that network traffic in Kubernetes is segregated.
5. Use [Transparent Encryption](../network/encryption/#gsg-encryption) in Cilium to ensure that communication between
   workloads is secured.
6. Enable Kubernetes audit logging, forward the audit logs to a centralized
   monitoring platform, and define alerting for suspicious activity.
7. Enable TLS for access to any externally-facing services, such as Hubble Relay
   and Hubble UI.
8. Use [Tetragon](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon) as a runtime security solution to rapidly detect unexpected
   behavior within your Kubernetes cluster.

posture, reach out to security@cilium.io.
