- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CP1W-CIF41 Ethernet Option Board stores its Web UI password in plaintext in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plaintext storage of a password (CWE-256).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who obtains this password could change the network settings of the option board.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can read the password from memory using the Omron FINS protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to use the Omron FINS protocol to access the device's memory. Network access to the device is implied.
