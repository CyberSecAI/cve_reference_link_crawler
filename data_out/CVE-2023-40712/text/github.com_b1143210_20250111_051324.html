### @hussein-awala **[hussein-awala](/hussein-awala)** commented [Aug 18, 2023](#issue-1857390750) ‚Ä¢ edited by potiuk Loading

closes: [#33478](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33478)

When there is no dag run (dag never being run, or wrong execution\_date), we create the TI from the raw task, and in this case we load the rendered values as plain values, and there is no way to retrieve the context to correctly redact them. For that it is unsafe to keep the values on the UI where there is no dagrun (no TI in the DB).
