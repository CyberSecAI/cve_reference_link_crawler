Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper file type validation during the avatar upload process on the `/admin/student.php` page of the Society Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system does not adequately filter or validate uploaded files, allowing users to upload files with executable extensions, specifically PHP files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP webshell, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows them to potentially take control of the server, access sensitive data, and perform other malicious activities.
- **Full System Compromise:** The uploaded webshell can be used as a backdoor for further exploitation and lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the avatar upload functionality on the `/admin/student.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the `/admin/student.php` page. The provided steps indicate that this can be achieved by exploiting an SQL Injection vulnerability on the `/admin/admin.php` page to bypass login restrictions.
- **File Upload Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to create a new user and upload an avatar, which are standard functions on the vulnerable page.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerable product is identified as **itsourcecode Society Management System v1.0**.
- The vulnerability is specifically located on the `/admin/student.php` page.
- The content details a multi-step exploitation process that first requires an SQL injection vulnerability to gain access to the system, followed by the use of the unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
- The content includes a link to the vulnerable source code, which could be used for analysis and verification.
- The file upload vulnerability was discovered and reported by "Dee.Mirage".
- There is a related VulDB entry with ID `272613`.
