- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an authorization bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software allows users to perform actions for which they are not authorized.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized modification of data, and limited information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker must have network access to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have low privileged access and need to trick a user to perform an action. The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R).
