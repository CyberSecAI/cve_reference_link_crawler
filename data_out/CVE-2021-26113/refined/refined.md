- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded, predictable salt during the password hashing process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt (CWE-760). This makes the password hashes vulnerable to offline cracking attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has gained access to the password file can use the known, hardcoded salt to attempt to crack the stored passwords. This can lead to information disclosure by allowing an attacker to gain access to the accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have prior access to the password file to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs access to the password file, but does not need special privileges and can be on the local network.
