  "response": {
    "relates_to_cve": true,
    "extracted_information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper access controls on commands within the application CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software. Specifically, the `confd_cli_grp` reads a file to determine user groups, but the username used in the file path is attacker-controlled, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access controls on commands within the application CLI.",
        "Path traversal vulnerability in `confd_cli_grp` when reading user group files.",
        "Path traversal vulnerability in `libnss_viptela.so` when checking the user validity.",
        "Potential stack buffer overflow in `confd_cli_grp` due to uncontrolled file content when loading group files."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the *root* user, resulting in a local privilege escalation. The vulnerability can lead to an unconstrained root shell.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access via the `vshell` command.",
        "Exploitation of the `confd_cli_grp` by setting the `USER` environment variable to trigger the path traversal.",
        "Man-in-the-middle attack by using `CONFD_IPC_PORT` to intercept and modify the session configuration parameters."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have local access to the affected device with the ability to execute commands via `vshell` or other means. The attacker also requires to set environment variables (e.g., `USER` and `CONFD_IPC_PORT`) to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to create files and symbolic links in writable directories such as `/tmp`"
    },
    "additional_details": "The provided content offers more details than the basic CVE description, including the specific vulnerable component (`confd_cli_grp`), the vulnerable library (`libnss_viptela.so`), the attack methodology (setting `USER` environment variable for path traversal), and a full proof-of-concept demonstration including a description of how to intercept and forge the signed session parameters using a Man-in-the-Middle attack. It also specifies the affected software versions and the fixed versions."
