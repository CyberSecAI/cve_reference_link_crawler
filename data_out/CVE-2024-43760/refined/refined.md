- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory boundaries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires user interaction (i.e., opening a specially crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file with a vulnerable version of Adobe Photoshop.
