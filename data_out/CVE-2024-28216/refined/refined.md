- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of access control on webhook request results.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure, limited Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain the results of webhook requests, leading to information disclosure and potentially limited SSRF.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by the lack of access control on webhook results, which could be accessed by an unauthorized attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the webhook results, which, due to the vulnerability, do not have appropriate access control.
