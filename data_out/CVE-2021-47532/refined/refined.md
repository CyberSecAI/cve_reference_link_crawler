The provided content relates to a fix for a reference count leak in the `msm_gpu_devfreq.c` driver, which is relevant to CVE-2021-47532, as the commit message indicates that it fixes an issue in the "drm/msm/devfreq" component.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reference count leak in the `msm_devfreq_target` function. Specifically, when `gpu->devfreq.idle_freq` is non-zero, the code was not releasing the `dev_pm_opp` object acquired by `devfreq_recommended_opp` function via `dev_pm_opp_put` causing a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak due to missing call to `dev_pm_opp_put` when the `gpu->devfreq.idle_freq` condition is met.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory leak that could lead to resource exhaustion and potentially a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when `msm_devfreq_target` is called with `gpu->devfreq.idle_freq` set to a non-zero value. This can be triggered via normal system operations that make use of GPU frequency scaling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities/position is mentioned or required to trigger the vulnerability, which can be triggered by a normal user of the system.
