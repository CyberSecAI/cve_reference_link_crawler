Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `prodInfo.php` file of the Online Furniture Shopping Ecommerce Website Project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`prodId` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive user or system data can be leaked.
- **Compromised System Security:** The overall security of the system can be compromised, potentially allowing for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `prodId` parameter in the `prodInfo.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the `prodId` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `prodId=0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate()%2Csleep(12)%2C0))XOR'Z` is designed to test for SQL injection by attempting to induce a time-based delay, which can be used to confirm the injection and leak information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable application is identified as "kashipara Online Furniture Shopping Ecommerce Website Project" version 1.0 or earlier.
- The vulnerability was discovered and submitted by "SSL_Seven_Security Lab_WangZhiQiang_XiaoZiLong".
- The vulnerability has been assigned VulDB entry ID `261797`.
