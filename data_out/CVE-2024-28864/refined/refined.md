Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a regular expression (`preg_match('/^<ENC>(.*)<\/ENC>$/'`) in the `TagAwareCipher` class to detect and extract encrypted data enclosed within `<ENC>` and `</ENC>` tags. This regex fails to properly handle special characters, such as newline characters (`\n`), within the encrypted data when a `NullEncoder` is used in the base cipher.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Regex Failure:** The regex used for tag detection is not robust enough to handle special characters present in the encrypted string, particularly when using a `NullEncoder`.
- **Bypass of Decryption:** When the regex fails to match the tags due to special characters, the decryption process is skipped, and the encrypted data is returned in plain format.
- **Dependency on Encoder:** The vulnerability is exposed when a `NullEncoder` is used in the base cipher, showcasing a dependency on encoder implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is the disclosure of encrypted data. If an attacker can control or inject data containing special characters, the `TagAwareCipher` fails to decrypt the data, thus exposing it in its encrypted, but still readable, form.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Data Injection/Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this by injecting or manipulating encrypted data to include special characters (e.g., newlines, tabs, or other regex meta characters) when a vulnerable encoder is being used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to interact with the vulnerable application/service.
- **Network Access:** Network access to the application using the vulnerable code is needed to send the malicious data.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker should be aware that the application is using `TagAwareCipher` with a vulnerable base cipher configuration utilizing `NullEncoder`
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to influence or control data input to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 of the `ilicmiljan/secure-props` package.
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the regex-based tag detection with a `substr()` based method.
- The patch was released in version 1.2.2.
- A workaround before patching included using the default `Base64Encoder` with the `TagAwareCipher`, although this can result in double encoding.
