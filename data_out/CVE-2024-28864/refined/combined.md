# [TagAwareCipher] - Decryption Failure (Regex Match)

Low

[IlicMiljan](/IlicMiljan)
published
GHSA-rj29-j2g4-77q8
Mar 16, 2024

## Package

composer

ilicmiljan/secure-props
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

1.20, 1.2.1

## Patched versions

1.2.2

## Description

### Impact

Vulnerability in **SecureProps** involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data.

This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.

The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default).

### Patches

The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version **1.2.2**.

### Workarounds

**The main recommendation is to update to the latest version as there are no breaking changes.**

If that's not possible, you can use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.

This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `Base64Encoder` by default.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @IlicMiljan **[IlicMiljan](/IlicMiljan)** commented [Mar 16, 2024](#issue-2190144865) • edited Loading

### Description of Changes

Replaced regex-based tag detection with a `substr()` based method for parsing tagged encrypted data, improving handling of special characters and formatting.

This fixes a bug where decryption was skipped due to special characters passed by base `Cipher`.

### Related Issue

Resolves: [#20](https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/issues/20)

### How Has This Been Tested?

The data was tested by encrypting and decrypting the base `Cipher` binary output.

### Checklist

Please confirm the following:

* I have tested my changes and corrected any errors.
* I have documented my changes if necessary.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[IlicMiljan](/IlicMiljan)** commented [Mar 15, 2024](#issue-2189229257)

| Describe the bug The library fails to process data encrypted by a cipher that utilizes a `NullEncoder,` which is then decorated with a `TagAwareCipher,` specifically when the encrypted data contains special characters such as newline (`\n`).  The issue arises in the regex-based mechanism that matches and extracts encrypted data encapsulated within `<ENC>` and `</ENC>` tags. Steps to Reproduce The issue can be replicated with the following steps:   1. Initialize an instance of `AdvancedEncryptionStandardCipher` with a `NullEncoder`, which returns data that may include special characters:     ```    $cipher = new AdvancedEncryptionStandardCipher('256-BIT-KEY', new NullEncoder());    ``` 2. Decorate the initialized cipher with `TagAwareCipher` to enable tag-based encapsulation:     ```    $cipher = new TagAwareCipher($cipher);    ``` 3. Use `ObjectEncryptionService` with the `TagAwareCipher` to encrypt data, ensuring the encrypted string contains special characters, such as `\n`:     ```    $encryptionService = new ObjectEncryptionService($cipher, $reader);    ``` 4. Attempt to decrypt or extract the encrypted content, observing the failure due to incorrect regex handling.  Expected behavior The library should correctly handle encrypted data containing special characters, including `\n`, when encapsulating and extracting content within `<ENC>` and `</ENC>` tags. Environment:  * SecureProps version: `1.2.*` * PHP version: `8.0`  Actual Output / Stack Trace When attempting to decrypt content that includes special characters, such as newline characters (`\n`), within the encrypted data encapsulated by `<ENC>` and `</ENC>` tags, the actual output is the encrypted string itself, rather than the expected decrypted content.  This indicates that the decryption process is erroneously bypassed or fails due to the regex pattern's inability to properly match and extract the content for decryption. The original encrypted string is returned instead of the decrypted data. |
