# [TagAwareCipher] - Decryption Failure (Regex Match)

Low

[IlicMiljan](/IlicMiljan)
published
GHSA-rj29-j2g4-77q8
Mar 16, 2024

## Package

composer

ilicmiljan/secure-props
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

1.20, 1.2.1

## Patched versions

1.2.2

## Description

### Impact

Vulnerability in **SecureProps** involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data.

This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.

The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default).

### Patches

The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version **1.2.2**.

### Workarounds

**The main recommendation is to update to the latest version as there are no breaking changes.**

If that's not possible, you can use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.

This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `Base64Encoder` by default.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
