The Interactive Contact Form and Multi Step Form Builder with Drag & Drop Editor â€“ Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'fnsf_af2_handel_file_upload' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary media to the site, even if no forms exist.
