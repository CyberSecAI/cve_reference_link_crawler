Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A filter bypass exists in the "Schedule Name" field within ZKTeco ZKBio CVSecurity 4.1.0. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the field by manipulating the "name" parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This means the malicious script is saved within the application's database and executed when other users access the affected data (in this case, the schedule list).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that steal cookies from administrators or other users.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Stolen cookies can be used to impersonate other users, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The injected scripts can perform various malicious actions within the context of the victim's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network/Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the ZKTeco ZKBio CVSecurity application.
*   **Form Field Injection:** The attacker manipulates the "name" parameter in the "Summer Schedule Name" field by intercepting the request (using tools like Burp Suite).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to ZKBio CVSecurity:** The attacker needs to have access to the ZKBio CVSecurity application with permissions to add or edit summer schedules.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests using tools like Burp Suite or similar web proxies.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is in the "Summer Schedule Name" field.
* The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how to inject the XSS payload.
* Any user accessing the schedule list is potentially vulnerable.
