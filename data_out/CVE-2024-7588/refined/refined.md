Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Accordion block of the Gutenberg Blocks, Page Builder – ComboBlocks plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied attributes within the Accordion block are not properly sanitized or escaped, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** When a user accesses a page containing the maliciously injected Accordion block, the stored JavaScript code is executed in their browser.
- This can lead to various impacts such as:
   - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting to malicious sites
    - Modifying page content
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an authenticated user (with Contributor access or higher) adds a malicious code via the Accordion Block of the plugin. The injected script executes when the page is viewed by any user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Access to Block Editor:**  The attacker needs the ability to edit pages and use the block editor where the vulnerable Accordion block is available.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable plugin is identified as "Gutenberg Blocks, Page Builder – ComboBlocks" (also referred to as "Post Grid").
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 2.2.87.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 2.2.88.
