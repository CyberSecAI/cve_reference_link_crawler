Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-29053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing cryptographic step in the functions responsible for encrypting keytab values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-325 (Missing Cryptographic Step):** The encryption process lacks a necessary step, leading to weakened encryption of the keytab values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who obtains the encrypted keytab secret can decipher it, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to have access to the encrypted secret values, which would likely require some level of prior access or compromise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in possession of the encrypted keytab values. This suggests an attacker with some level of access, likely local, to the system storing these values, or able to intercept them.
