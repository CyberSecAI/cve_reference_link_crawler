The 140+ Widgets | Best Addons For Elementor â€“ FREE for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.4.3.1 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'export_content' function. This allows authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
