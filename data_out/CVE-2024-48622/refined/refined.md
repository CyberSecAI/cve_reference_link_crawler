- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cdfid` parameter in `edit.php` is directly concatenated to `$_SESSION['s_message_danger']` without proper validation, and is later output to the frontend.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and get a user to visit it.
