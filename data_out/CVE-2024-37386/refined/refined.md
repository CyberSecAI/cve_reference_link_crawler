- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Certain manipulations allow restarting the system in single user mode despite the activation of secure boot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the ability to bypass secure boot protections and access single-user mode through specific manipulations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system in single-user mode, potentially leading to confidentiality breaches. The confidentiality impact is rated as "High," while integrity and availability impacts are "None" according to CVSS scores.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the device and has to perform specific manipulations to trigger the vulnerability. The attack complexity is considered "High" meaning it requires specialized knowledge or techniques to exploit. The attacker does not require any privileges.
