Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `posttitle` parameter in the `/admin/edit-post.php` script of the News Portal System version 4.1 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromise of application:** Attackers can potentially gain control over the web application.
- **Data Access/Modification:** Attackers can access and modify sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Database Exploitation:** Attackers could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the database itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/admin/edit-post.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `posttitle` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials for the `subadmin` user to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the application and SQL:** The attacker must understand how to craft SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was tested on Kali Linux with PHP 8.2.12 and Apache 2.4.58.
- The provided SQLmap command demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by dumping the database.
- The vulnerable software is the News Portal System version 4.1, available from the vendor's website: `https://phpgurukul.com/news-portal-project-in-php-and-mysql/` and `https://phpgurukul.com/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=7643`
