The provided content is related to CVE-2018-9195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded cryptographic key within the FortiGuard services communication protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded cryptographic key
- Lack of secure communication protocol (prior to fixes)

**Impact of exploitation:**
A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker who knows the hardcoded key can:
- Eavesdrop on communications between FortiGate/FortiClient and FortiGuard servers.
- Decrypt sensitive information within the communication.
- Modify the information sent and received.
- In FortiOS 5.6, the URL/SPAM services are affected.
- In FortiOS 6.0, URL/SPAM/AV services are affected.
- In FortiClient, URL rating is affected.
- For AV communication exposure on FortiOS 6.0 and above, the only impact is if outbreak protection is enabled in the antivirus profile settings.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the network path between a vulnerable device (FortiGate/FortiClient) and FortiGuard servers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable device and FortiGuard servers.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the hardcoded cryptographic key.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSSv3 score of 6.2.
- FortiOS versions below 6.0.8 are vulnerable.
- FortiClientWindows versions below 6.2.0 and FortiClientMac versions below 6.2.2 are vulnerable.
- The fix involves upgrading to specific versions and changing the communication protocol to TLS.
