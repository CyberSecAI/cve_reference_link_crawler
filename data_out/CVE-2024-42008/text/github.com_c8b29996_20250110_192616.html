[`44ed0d6`](/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/44ed0d6fb0cefe30c9c7892c61c34a21a7213c56)

This is a security update to the stable version 1.6 of Roundcube Webmail.

It provides fixes to recently reported security vulnerabilities:

* Fix XSS vulnerability in post-processing of sanitized HTML content [[CVE-2024-42009](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j43g-prf4-578j "CVE-2024-42009")]
* Fix XSS vulnerability in serving of attachments other than HTML or SVG [[CVE-2024-42008](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78jf-j6qx-c7j3 "CVE-2024-42008")]
* Fix information leak (access to remote content) via insufficient CSS filtering [[CVE-2024-42010](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-853r-xr2f-r2x6 "CVE-2024-42010")]

Credits to Oskar Zeino-Mahmalat ([Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com)) for all these findings and thanks for providing a very detailed report in a private communication.

This version is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations of Roundcube 1.6.x with it. Please do backup your data before updating!
