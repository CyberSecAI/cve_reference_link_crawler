Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-36136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of stored passwords. Specifically, the application stores user passwords in a way that allows them to be displayed in clear text within the administrative panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Clear Text Password Storage:** The primary weakness is the storage of passwords in a non-encrypted format, making them directly readable.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability leads to information disclosure within the admin panel where user passwords are shown in clear text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Data Compromise:** An attacker with access to the administrative panel can view all user passwords in clear text.
- **Account Takeover:** The exposed passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Complete System Compromise:** If admin accounts are also affected by this clear text password exposure, it could lead to a complete compromise of the system and all its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Admin Account:** An attacker who gains access to the admin panel, whether through compromised credentials or other vulnerabilities, can exploit this weakness.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Panel Access:** The attacker must have administrative access to the affected application. This can be achieved through various means, such as password guessing, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or social engineering.
