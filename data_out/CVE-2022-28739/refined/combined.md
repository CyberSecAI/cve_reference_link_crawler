Package        : ruby2.5
Version        : 2.5.5-3+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-33621 CVE-2022-28739
Debian Bug     : 1009957 1024800 1037178

A couple of security issues were discovered in ruby2.5, the Ruby
interpreter, and are as follows -

CVE-2021-33621

    Hiroshi Tokumaru discovered that Ruby did not properly handle
    certain user input for applications the generate HTTP responses
    using cgi gem. An attacker could possibly use this issue to
    maliciously modify the response a user would receive from a
    vulnerable application.

CVE-2022-28739

    It was discovered that Ruby incorrectly handled certain inputs.
    An attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive
    information.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed, along with the
regressions caused by the last Ruby update, in version 2.5.5-3+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.5 packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby2.5 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby2.5>

# CVE-2022-28739: Buffer overrun in String-to-Float conversion

Posted by mame on 12 Apr 2022

A buffer-overrun vulnerability is discovered in a conversion algorithm from a String to a Float.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2022-28739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-28739).
We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby.

## Details

Due to a bug in an internal function that converts a String to a Float, some conversion methods like `Kernel#Float` and `String#to_f` could cause buffer over-read.
A typical consequence is a process termination due to segmentation fault, but under limited circumstances, it may be exploitable for illegal memory read.

Please update Ruby to 2.6.10, 2.7.6, 3.0.4, or 3.1.2.

## Affected versions

* ruby 2.6.9 or prior
* ruby 2.7.5 or prior
* ruby 3.0.3 or prior
* ruby 3.1.1 or prior

## Credits

Thanks to [piao](https://hackerone.com/piao?type=user) for discovering this issue.
