### Recommendations

Autodesk strongly recommends that users of Autodesk Design Review 2018 and earlier download and install the security hotfix referenced above via the [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-design-review-2018-hotfix-5.html). Customers of Autodesk Design Review 2013 or earlier will need to upgrade to version 2018 or later by following the installation instructions outlined in the [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-design-review-2018-hotfix-5.html) article.

In addition, users of the 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 versions of Autodesk® Advance Steel, Autodesk® Civil 3D, AutoCAD®, AutoCAD® LT, and AutoCAD-based specialized toolsets listed in the table above should install the latest AutoCAD® or AutoCAD LT, as applicable, via the Autodesk Desktop App or [Accounts Portal](https://manage.autodesk.com/). An update is not available for 32bit AutoCAD 2019. Customers using this version should plan to upgrade to 64bit AutoCAD 2019 or a newer AutoCAD version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities.

Customers using previous versions that no longer qualify for full support should plan to upgrade to a supported version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities. Visit the Autodesk Knowledge Network for more information about previous version support.
