Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation and sanitization when handling file uploads in the `/admin/create-package.php` file of the Codezips Tourist Management System. Specifically, the `$_FILES` variable is directly used to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without any checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload any file type without restrictions.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the file type, size, or content before saving it to the server.
*   **Direct Use of `$_FILES`:**  The script directly uses the `$_FILES` variable without any sanitization, making it vulnerable to various attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) and execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **File Overwrite:** Attackers could overwrite existing files, potentially corrupting the application or its data.
*   **File Injection:** Malicious files can be injected into the system.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Attackers may be able to navigate to and write to arbitrary directories on the server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Uploading large or malicious files could lead to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to `/admin/create-package.php`. This request includes form data and a malicious file payload.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious file is sent using multipart form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the location of the `/admin/create-package.php` endpoint.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with multipart form data.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was found in version 1.0 of the software.
*   The vulnerable code is located on line 80 of `/admin/create-package.php` according to the VulDB description, and line 19 according to the GitHub issue. The GitHub issue also references an image with the vulnerable code snippet but the provided link is unavailable.
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) payload is provided in the GitHub issue, demonstrating how to upload a PHP file containing a system command and execute it.
