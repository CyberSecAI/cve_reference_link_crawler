##### OpenVPN 2.6.12 -- Released 18 July 2024

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.12. This is a bugfix release.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.12/Changes.rst)

Bug fixes:

* the fix for CVE-2024-5594 (refuse control channel messages with nonprintable characters) was too strict, breaking user configurations with AUTH\_FAIL messages having trailing CR/NL characters. This often happens if the AUTH\_FAIL reason is set by a script. Strip those before testing the command buffer (github [​#568](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/568)). Also, add unit test.
* Http-proxy: fix bug preventing proxy credentials caching (trac [#1187](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/1187 "#1187: Bug / Defect: http-proxy fails with: Assertion failed at proxy.c:250 ... (assigned)"))

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.11:

* Built against OpenSSL 3.3.1
* Included openvpn-gui updated to 11.50.0.0
  + Update Italian language (github [​#696](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui/pull/696))

##### OpenVPN 2.6.11 -- Released 20 June 2024

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.11. This is a bugfix release containing several security fixes.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.11/Changes.rst)

Security fixes:

* [​CVE-2024-4877](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4877): Windows: harden interactive service pipe. Security scope: a malicious process with "some" elevated privileges (SeImpersonatePrivilege) could open the pipe a second time, tricking openvn GUI into providing user credentials (tokens), getting full access to the account openvpn-gui.exe runs as. (Zeze with TeamT5)
* [​CVE-2024-5594](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-5594): control channel: refuse control channel messages with nonprintable characters in them. Security scope: a malicious openvpn peer can send garbage to openvpn log, or cause high CPU load. (Reynir Björnsson)
* [​CVE-2024-28882](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28882): only call schedule\_exit() once (on a given peer). Security scope: an authenticated client can make the server "keep the session" even when the server has been told to disconnect this client (Reynir Björnsson)

New features:

* Windows Crypto-API: Implement Windows CA template match for searching certificates in windows crypto store.
* Support pre-created DCO interface on FreeBSD (OpenVPN would fail to set ifmode p2p/subnet otherwise)

Bug fixes:

* Fix connect timeout when using SOCKS proxies (trac [#328](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/328 "#328: Bug / Defect: openvpn client gives up instead of retrying when proxy server is slow (closed: fixed)"), github [​#267](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/267))
* Work around LibreSSL crashing on OpenBSD 7.5 when enumerating ciphers (LibreSSL bug, already fixed upstream, but not backported to OpenBSD 7.5, see also [​LibreSSL/OpenBSD#150](https://github.com/libressl/openbsd/issues/150))
* Add bracket in fingerprint message and do not warn about missing verification (github [​#516](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/516))

Documentation:

* Remove "experimental" denotation for --fast-io
* Correctly document ifconfig\_\* variables passed to scripts
* Documentation: make section levels consistent
* Samples: Update sample configurations (remove compression & old cipher settings, add more informative comments)

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.10:

* For the Windows-specific security fixes see above
* Built against OpenSSL 3.3.1
* Included openvpn-gui updated to 11.49.0.0
  + Contains part of the fix for [​CVE-2024-4877](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4877)

Note: Windows MSI was updated to I002 on June 26th. Changes in I002:

* Group names are localized in some localizations, so we have to use SIDs. (Github: [​#671](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-build/issues/671))

Reported-by: Vladimir Tokarev <vtokarev@microsoft.com>
* [​CVE-2024-1305](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1305): Windows TAP driver: Fix potential integer overflow in TapSharedSendPacket. Reported-by: Vladimir Tokarev <vtokarev@microsoft.com>

##### OpenVPN 2.6.9 -- Released 12 February 2024

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.9. This is a bugfix release containing one security fix for the Windows installer.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.9/Changes.rst)

Security fixes:

* Windows Installer: fix [​CVE-2023-7235](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-7235) where installing to a non-default directory could lead to a local privilege escalation. Reported by Will Dormann.

New features:

* Add support for building with mbedTLS 3.x.x
* New option `--force-tls-key-material-export` to only accept clients that can do TLS keying material export to generate session keys (mostly an internal option to better deal with TLS 1.0 PRF failures).
* Windows: bump vcpkg-ports/pkcs11-helper to 1.30
* Log incoming SSL alerts in easier to understand form and move logging from `--verb 8` to `--verb 3`.
* protocol\_dump(): add support for printing `--tls-crypt` packets

User visible changes:

* License change is now complete, and all code has been re-licensed under the new license (still GPLv2, but with new linking exception for Apache2 licensed code). See [​COPYING](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/release/2.6/COPYING) for details.

> Code that could not be re-licensed has been removed or rewritten.

* The original code for the `--tls-export-cert` feature has been removed (due to the re-licensing effort) and rewritten without looking at the original code. Feature-compatibility has been tested by other developers, looking at both old and new code and documentation, so there \*should\* not be a user-visible change here.
* IPv6 route addition/deletion are now logged on the same level (3) as for IPv4. Previously IPv6 was always logged at `--verb 1`.
* Better handling of TLS 1.0 PRF failures in the underlying SSL library (e.g. on some FIPS builds) - this is now reported on startup, and clients before 2.6.0 that can not use TLS EKM to generate key material are rejected by the server. Also, error messages are improved to see what exactly failed.

Notable bug fixes:

* FreeBSD: for servers with multiple clients, reporting of peer traffic statistics would fail due to insufficient buffer space (Github: [​#487](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/487))

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.8:

* Security fix, see above

##### OpenVPN 2.6.8 -- Released 17 November 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.8. This is a small bugfix release fixing a few regressions in 2.6.7 release.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.8/Changes.rst)

User visible changes:

* Windows: print warning if pushed options require DHCP (e.g. DOMAIN-SEARCH) and driver in use does not use DHCP (wintun, dco).

Bug fixes:

* SIGSEGV crash: Do not check key\_state buffers that are in S\_UNDEF state (Github [​#449](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/449)) - the new sanity check function introduced in 2.6.7 sometimes tried to use a NULL pointer after an unsuccessful TLS handshake
* Windows: `--dns` option did not work when tap-windows6 driver was used, because internal flag for "apply DNS option to DHCP server" wasn't set (Github [​#447](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/447))
* Windows: fix status/log file permissions, caused by regression after changing to CMake build system (Github: [​#454](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/454), Trac: [​#1430](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/1430))
* Windows: fix `--chdir` failures, also caused by error in CMake build system (Github [​#448](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/448))

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.7:

* Included openvpn-gui updated to 11.46.0.0

##### OpenVPN 2.6.7 -- Released 9 November 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.7. This is a bugfix release containing security fixes.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.7/Changes.rst)

Security Fixes:

* [​CVE-2023-46850](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46850) OpenVPN versions between 2.6.0 and 2.6.6 incorrectly use a send buffer after it has been free()d in some circumstances, causing some free()d memory to be sent to the peer. All configurations using TLS (e.g. not using --secret) are affected by this issue. (found while tracking down CVE-2023-46849 / Github [​#400](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/400), [​#417](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/417))
* [​CVE-2023-46849](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46849) OpenVPN versions between 2.6.0 and 2.6.6 incorrectly restore `--fragment` configuration in some circumstances, leading to a division by zero when `--fragment` is used. On platforms where division by zero is fatal, this will cause an OpenVPN crash. (Github [​#400](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/400), [​#417](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/417)).

User visible changes:

* DCO: warn if DATA\_V1 packets are sent by the other side - this a hard incompatibility between a 2.6.x client connecting to a 2.4.0-2.4.4 server, and the only fix is to use `--disable-dco`.
* Remove OpenSSL Engine method for loading a key. This had to be removed because the original author did not agree to relicensing the code with the new linking exception added. This was a somewhat obsolete feature anyway as it only worked with OpenSSL 1.x, which is end-of-support.
* add warning if p2p NCP client connects to a p2mp server - this is a combination that used to work without cipher negotiation (pre 2.6 on both ends), but would fail in non-obvious ways with 2.6 to 2.6.
* add warning to `--show-groups` that not all supported groups are listed (this is due the internal enumeration in OpenSSL being a bit weird, omitting X448 and X25519 curves).
* `--dns`: remove support for `exclude-domains` argument (this was a new 2.6 option, with no backend support implemented yet on any platform, and it turns out that no platform supported it at all - so remove option again)
* warn user if INFO control message too long, do not forward to management client (safeguard against protocol-violating server implementations)

New features:

* DCO-WIN: get and log driver version (for easier debugging).
* print "peer temporary key details" in TLS handshake
* log OpenSSL errors on failure to set certificate, for example if the algorithms used are in acceptable to OpenSSL (misleading message would be printed in cryptoapi / pkcs11 scenarios)
* add CMake build system for MinGW and MSVC builds
* remove old MSVC build system
* improve cmocka unit test building for Windows

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.6:

* Included openvpn-gui updated to 11.45.0.0
  + Add clarity for error on missing management parameter. See GH [​#657](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui/issues/657)
  + Improve "OpenVPN GUI" tooltip handling See GH [​#649](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui/issues/649)
* MSIs now use OpenSSL 3.1.4

##### OpenVPN 2.6.6 -- Released 15 August 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.6. This is a small bugfix release.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.6/Changes.rst)

User visible changes:

* OCC exit messages are now logged more visibly See GH [​#391](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/391).
* OpenSSL error messages are now logged with more details (for example, when loading a provider fails, which .so was tried, and why did it fail) See GH [​#361](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/361).
* print a more user-friendly message when tls-crypt-v2 client auth fails
* packaging now includes all documentation in the source tarball

New features:

* set WINS server via interactive service - this adds support for "dhcp-option WINS 192.0.2.1" for DCO + wintun interfaces where no DHCP server is used. See GH [​#373](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/373).

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.5:

* Included openvpn-gui updated to 11.44.0.0
* MSIs now use OpenSSL 3.1.2

##### OpenVPN 2.6.5 -- Released 13 June 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.5. This is a small bugfix release.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.5/Changes.rst)

User visible changes:

* tapctl (windows): generate driver-specific names (if using tapctl to create additional tap/wintun/dco devices, and not using --name). See GH [​#337](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/337).
* interactive service (windows): do not force target desktop for openvpn.exe - this has no impact for normal use, but enables running of OpenVPN in a scripted way when no user is logged on (for example, via task scheduler). See GH [​openvpn-gui#626](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui/issues/626)

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.4:

* MSIs now use OpenSSL 3.1.1

Debian/Ubuntu packages in [OpenvpnSoftwareRepos](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/OpenvpnSoftwareRepos) are now available for arm64.

##### OpenVPN 2.6.4 -- Released 11 May 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.4. This is a small bugfix release.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.4/Changes.rst)

Note:

* **License amendment**: all **new** commits fall under a modified license that explicitly permits linking with Apache2 libraries (mbedTLS, OpenSSL) - see COPYING for details. Existing code will fall under the new license as soon as all contributors have agreed to the change - work ongoing.

Feature changes:

* DCO: support kernel-triggered key rotation (avoid IV reuse after 232 packets). This is the userland side, accepting a message from kernel, and initiating a TLS renegotiation. As of 2.6.4 release, only implemented in FreeBSD kernel.

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.3:

* Rebuilt included tap-windows driver with the correct version of the old Windows 7 driver, removing a warning about unsigned driver on Windows 7 installation. See GH [​openvpn-build#365](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-build/issues/365).

##### OpenVPN 2.6.3 -- Released 13 April 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.3. This is a small bugfix release.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.3/Changes.rst)

Feature changes:

* Windows: support setting DNS domain in configurations without GUI and DHCP (typically wintun or windco drivers), see GH [​openvpn#306](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/issues/306).

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.2:

* Several Windows-specific issues fixed:
  + ensure interactive service stays enabled after silent reinstall, see GH [​openvpn-build#348](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-build/issues/348), [​openvpn-build#349](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-build/issues/349) and [​openvpn-build#351](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-build/issues/351)
  + repair querying install path info for easyrsa-start.bat on some Windows language versions, see GH [​openvpn-build#352](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-build/issues/352).
* MSIs are now built against OpenSSL 3.1.0.
* Update included openvpn-gui to 11.41.0.0
  + This update removes the ability to change the password of a private key from the GUI. This was a niche feature which caused a direct dependency of GUI on OpenSSL. Use openssl.exe directly if you need to edit a private key.

Note: Windows MSI was updated to I003 on April 26th. Changes in I003:

* The GPG subkey for creating the .asc files for the downloads has been updated. You might need to re-download or update the GPG key if verifying the signatures.
* Fix the encoding of some documentation/sample files included in the installer. See GH [​openvpn-build#358](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-build/issues/358)
* Update include tap-windows6 driver to 9.25.0
  + Fixes a problem with sending small non-IP packets (e.g. PPPoE) over the VPN connection. See GH [​tap-windows6#158](https://github.com/OpenVPN/tap-windows6/issues/158)
  + Note: The new driver is only used on Windows 10 and newer. We can't rebuild drivers for Windows 7/8 since Microsoft doesn't support the signing mechanism anymore. We include the previous driver version to still allow installation on Windows 7/8.
* Update included openvpn-gui to 11.42.0.0
  + Fixes a problem with passphrase prompt was sometimes not displayed. See GH [​openvpn-gui#619](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui/issues/619)
  + Adds "Password Reveal" feature which allows you to see passwords while entering them.

##### OpenVPN 2.6.2 -- Released 24 March 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.2. This is mostly a bugfix release with some improvements.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.2/Changes.rst)

Feature changes:

* implement byte counter statistics for DCO Linux (p2mp server and client)
* implement byte counter statistics for DCO Windows (client only)
* `--dns server <n> address ...` now permits up to 8 v4 or v6 addresses

**Important note for Linux DCO users**:

* New control packets flow for data channel offloading on Linux: 2.6.2+ changes the way OpenVPN control packets are handled on Linux when DCO is active, fixing the lockups observed with 2.6.0/2.6.1 under high client connect/disconnect activity. This is an **INCOMPATIBLE** change and therefore an ovpn-dco kernel module older than v0.2.20230323 (commit ID 726fdfe0fa21) will not work anymore and must be upgraded. The kernel module was renamed to "ovpn-dco-v2.ko" in order to highlight this change and ensure that users and userspace software could easily understand which version is loaded. Attempting to use the old ovpn-dco with 2.6.2+ will lead to disabling DCO at runtime.

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.1:

* Update included openvpn-gui to 11.39.0.0

##### OpenVPN 2.6.1 -- Released 8 March 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.1. This is mostly a bugfix release with some improvements.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.1/Changes.rst)

Feature changes:

* Dynamic TLS Crypt: When both peers are OpenVPN 2.6.1+, OpenVPN will dynamically create a tls-crypt key that is used for renegotiation. This ensure that only the previously authenticated peer can do trigger renegotiation and complete renegotiations.
* CryptoAPI (Windows): support issuer name as a selector. Certificate selection string can now specify a partial issuer name string as

Note: configure now enables DCO build by default on FreeBSD and Linux. On Linux this brings in a new default dependency for libnl-genl (for Linux distributions that are too old to have a suitable version of the library, use "configure --disable-dco")

Windows MSI changes since 2.6.1:

* Update included ovpn-dco-win driver to 0.9.2

##### OpenVPN 2.6.0 -- Released 25 January 2023

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.6.0. This is a new stable release with some major new features.

For details see: [Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.6.0/Changes.rst)

The Changes document also contains a section with workarounds for common problems encountered when using OpenVPN with OpenSSL 3.

New features and improvements in 2.6.0 compared to 2.5.8:

* Data Channel Offload (DCO) kernel acceleration support for Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD.
* OpenSSL 3 support.
* Improved handling of tunnel MTU, including support for pushable MTU.
* Outdated cryptographic algorithms disabled by default, but there are options to override if necessary.

##### OpenVPN 2.5.10 -- Released 21 March 2024

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.5.10. This is a bugfix release containing several security fixes specific to the Windows platform.

For details see [​Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/v2.5.10/Changes.rst)

Note that OpenVPN 2.5.x is in "Old Stable Support" status (see [SupportedVersions](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SupportedVersions)). This usually means that we do not provide updated Windows Installers anymore, even for security fixes. Since this release fixes several issues specific to the Windows platform we decided to provide installers anyway. This does not change the support status of 2.5.x branch. We might not provide security updates for issues found in the future. We recommend that everyone switch to the 2.6.x versions of installers as soon as possible.

Security fixes:

* [​CVE-2024-27459](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27459): Windows: fix a possible stack overflow in the interactive service component which might lead to a local privilege escalation. Reported-by: Vladimir Tokarev <vtokarev@microsoft.com>
* [​CVE-2024-24974](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24974): Windows: disallow access to the interactive service pipe from remote computers. Reported-by: Vladimir Tokarev <vtokarev@microsoft.com>
* [​CVE-2024-27903](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27903): Windows: disallow loading of plugins from untrusted installation paths, which could be used to attack `openvpn.exe` via a malicious plugin. Plugins can now only be loaded from the OpenVPN install directory, the Windows system directory, and possibly from a directory specified by `HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenVPN\plugin_dir`. Reported-by: Vladimir Tokarev <vtokarev@microsoft.com>
* [​CVE-2024-1305](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1305): Windows TAP driver: Fix potential integer overflow in TapSharedSendPacket. Reported-by: Vladimir Tokarev <vtokarev@microsoft.com>

Windows MSI changes since 2.5.10:

* For the Windows-specific security fixes see above
* Built against OpenSSL 1.1.1w
  + Note that OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not supported anymore, so this might not address all known issues in OpenSSL 1.1.1. If that concerns you, please switch to OpenVPN 2.6.x
* Included tap6-windows driver updated to 9.27.0
  + Security fix, see above

##### OpenVPN 2.5.4 -- Released 5 Oct, 2021

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.5.4. This release include a number of fixes and small improvements. One of the fixes is to password prompting on windows console when stderr redirection is in use - this breaks 2.5.x on Win11/ARM, and might also break on Win11/amd64. Windows executable and libraries are now built natively on Windows using MSVC, not cross-compiled on Linux as with earlier 2.5 releases. Windows installers include updated OpenSSL and new OpenVPN GUI. The latter includes several improvements, the most important of which is the ability to import profiles from URLs where available. Installer version I602 fixes loading of pkcs11 files on Windows. Installer version I603 fixes a bug in the version number as seen by Windows (was 2.5..4, not 2.5.4). Installer I604 fixes some small Windows issues.

## Important notices

### BF-CBC cipher is no longer the default

Cipher handling for the data channel cipher has been significantly changed between OpenVPN 2.3/2.4 and v2.5, most notably there are no "default cipher BF-CBC" anymore because it is no longer considered a reasonable default. BF-CBC is still available, but it needs to be explicitly configured now.

For connections between OpenVPN 2.4 and v2.5 clients and servers, both ends will be able  to negotiate a better cipher than BF-CBC. By default they will select one of the AES-GCM ciphers, but this can be influenced using the --data-ciphers setting.

Connections between OpenVPN 2.3 and v2.5 that have no --cipher setting in the config (= defaulting to BF-CBC and not being negotiation-capable) **must** be updated. Unless BF-CBC is included in --data-ciphers or there is a "--cipher BF-CBC" in the OpenVPN 2.5 config, a v2.5 client or server will **refuse** to talk to a v2.3 server or client, because it has no common data channel cipher and negotiating a cipher is not possible. Generally, we recommend upgrading such setups to OpenVPN 2.4 or v2.5. If upgrading is not possible we recommend adding *data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:AES-128-CBC* (for v2.5+) or *cipher AES-128-CBC* (v2.4.x and older) to the configuration of all clients and servers.

If you really need to use an unsupported OpenVPN 2.3 (or even older) release and need to stay on BF-CBC (not recommended), the OpenVPN 2.5 based client will need a config file change to re-enable BF-CBC.  But be warned that BF-CBC and other related weak ciphers will be removed in coming OpenVPN major releases.

For full details see the "[Data channel cipher negotiation](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/man-sections/cipher-negotiation.rst)" section on the man page.
### Connectivity to some VPN service provider may break

Connecting with an OpenVPN 2.5 client to at least one commercial VPN service that
implemented their own cipher negotiation method that always reports back that it is using BF-CBC to the client is broken in v2.5. This has always caused warning about mismatch ciphers. We have been in contact with some service providers and they are looking into it.  This is not something the OpenVPN community can fix.  If your commercial VPN does not work with a v2.5 client, complain to the VPN service provider.

More details on these new features as well as a list of deprecated features and user-visible changes are available in [Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/release/2.5/Changes.rst).

Connections between OpenVPN 2.3 and v2.5 that have no --cipher setting in the config (= defaulting to BF-CBC and not being negotiation-capable) **must** be updated. Unless BF-CBC is included in --data-ciphers or there is a "--cipher BF-CBC" in the OpenVPN 2.5 config, a v2.5 client or server will **refuse** to talk to a v2.3 server or client, because it has no common data channel cipher and negotiating a cipher is not possible. Generally, we recommend upgrading such setups to OpenVPN 2.4 or v2.5. If upgrading is not possible we recommend adding *data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:AES-128-CBC* (for v2.5+) or *cipher AES-128-CBC* (v2.4.x and older) to the configuration of all clients and servers.

If you really need to use an unsupported OpenVPN 2.3 (or even older) release and need to stay on BF-CBC (not recommended), the OpenVPN 2.5 based client will need a config file change to re-enable BF-CBC.  But be warned that BF-CBC and other related weak ciphers will be removed in coming OpenVPN major releases.

For full details see the "[Data channel cipher negotiation](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/man-sections/cipher-negotiation.rst)" section on the man page.
### Connectivity to some VPN service provider may break

Connecting with an OpenVPN 2.5 client to at least one commercial VPN service that
implemented their own cipher negotiation method that always reports back that it is using BF-CBC to the client is broken in v2.5. This has always caused warning about mismatch ciphers. We have been in contact with some service providers and they are looking into it.  This is not something the OpenVPN community can fix.  If your commercial VPN does not work with a v2.5 client, complain to the VPN service provider.

More details on these new features as well as a list of deprecated features and user-visible changes are available in [Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/release/2.5/Changes.rst).

##### OpenVPN 2.5.2 -- Released 21 April, 2021

The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.5.2. It fixes two related security vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-15078) which under very specific circumstances allow tricking a server using delayed authentication (plugin or management) into returning a PUSH\_REPLY before the AUTH\_FAILED message, which can possibly be used to gather information about a VPN setup. In combination with "--auth-gen-token" or a user-specific token auth solution it can be possible to get access to a VPN with an otherwise-invalid account. OpenVPN 2.5.2 also includes other bug fixes and improvements. Updated OpenSSL and OpenVPN GUI are included in Windows installers.

Please note that LibreSSL is not a supported crypto backend. We accept patches and we do test on OpenBSD 6.0 which comes with LibreSSL, but if newer versions of LibreSSL break API compatibility we do not take responsibility to fix that.

Also note that Windows installers have been built with NSIS version that has been patched against several [NSIS installer code execution and privilege escalation problems](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NSISBug1125). Based on our testing, though, older Windows versions such as Windows 7 might not benefit from these fixes. *We thus strongly encourage you to always move NSIS installers to a non-user-writeable location before running them.*

Please note that OpenVPN 2.4 installers *will not* work on Windows XP. The last OpenVPN version that supports Windows XP is 2.3.18, which is downloadable as [32-bit](https://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/openvpn-install-2.3.18-I001-i686.exe) and [64-bit](https://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/openvpn-install-2.3.18-I001-x86_64.exe) versions.

If you find a bug in this release, please file a bug report to our [Trac bug tracker](https://community.openvpn.net/). In uncertain cases please contact our developers first, either using the [openvpn-devel mailinglist](https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/openvpn-devel) or the developer IRC channel (#openvpn-devel at irc.libera.chat). For generic help take a look at our official [documentation](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/), [wiki](https://community.openvpn.net/), [forums](https://forums.openvpn.net/), [openvpn-users mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=48978) and user IRC channel (#openvpn at irc.libera.chat).

**Important:** you will *need* to use the correct installer for your operating system. The Windows 10 installer works on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019. The Windows 7 installer will work on Windows 7/8/8.1/Server 2012r2. This is because of Microsoft's driver signing requirements are different for kernel-mode devices drivers, which in our case affects OpenVPN's tap driver (tap-windows6).

##### OpenVPN 2.4.10 -- Released 9 December, 2020

This is primarily a maintenance release with bugfixes and small improvements. Windows installers include the latest OpenSSL version (1.1.1i) which includes security fixes.

##### OpenVPN 2.4.9 -- Released 17 April, 2020

This is primarily a maintenance release with bugfixes and improvements. This release also fixes a security issue (CVE-2020-11810, trac #1272) which allows disrupting service of a freshly connected client that has not yet not negotiated session keys. The vulnerability cannot be used to inject or steal VPN traffic.

A summary of the changes is available in [Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/release/2.4/Changes.rst), and a full list of changes is available [here](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/ChangesInOpenvpn24).

Please note that LibreSSL is not a supported crypto backend. We accept patches and we do test on OpenBSD 6.0 which comes with LibreSSL, but if newer versions of LibreSSL break API compatibility we do not take responsibility to fix that.

Also note that Windows installers have been built with NSIS version that has been patched against several [NSIS installer code execution and privilege escalation problems](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NSISBug1125). Based on our testing, though, older Windows versions such as Windows 7 might not benefit from these fixes. *We thus strongly encourage you to always move NSIS installers to a non-user-writeable location before running them*. We are moving to MSI installers in OpenVPN 2.5, but OpenVPN 2.4.x will remain NSIS-only.

Compared to OpenVPN 2.3 this is a major update with a large number of new features, improvements and fixes. Some of the major features are AEAD (GCM) cipher and Elliptic Curve DH key exchange support, improved IPv4/IPv6 dual stack support and more seamless connection migration when client's IP address changes (Peer-ID). Also, the new --tls-crypt feature can be used to increase users' connection privacy.

OpenVPN GUI bundled with the Windows installer has a large number of new features compared to the one bundled with OpenVPN 2.3. One of major features is the ability to run OpenVPN GUI without administrator privileges. For full details, see the [changelog](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/ChangesInOpenvpn24). The new OpenVPN GUI features are documented [here](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui/).

Please note that OpenVPN 2.4 installers *will not* work on Windows XP.

##### OpenVPN 2.4.7 -- Released 21 February, 2019

This is primarily a maintenance release with bugfixes and improvements. One of the big things is enhanced TLS 1.3 support. A summary of the changes is available in [Changes.rst](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/release/2.4/Changes.rst), and a full list of changes is available [here](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/ChangesInOpenvpn24).

**Important:** you will *need* to use the correct installer for your operating system. The Windows 10 installer will not work on Windows 7/8/8.1/Server 2012r2. This is because Microsoft's driver signing requirements and tap-windows6. For the same reason you need to use an older installer with Windows Server 2016. This older installer has a [local privilege escalation vulnerability issue](https://github.com/OpenVPN/tap-windows6/commit/443bb3b033c167467defa755b6d210e10c2dcd34) which we cannot resolve for Windows Server 2016 until tap-windows6 passes the HLK test suite on that platform. In the meanwhile we recommend Windows Server 2016 users to avoid installing OpenVPN/tap-windows6 driver on hosts where all users can't be trusted. Users of Windows 7-10 and Server 2012r2 are recommended to update to latest installers as soon as possible.

##### OpenVPN 2.4.6 -- Released 24 April, 2018

This is primarily a maintenance release with minor bugfixes and improvements, and one security relevant fix for the Windows Interactive Service. Windows installer includes updated OpenVPN GUI and OpenSSL. Installer I601 included tap-windows6 driver 9.22.1 which had one security fix and dropped Windows Vista support. However, in installer I602 we had to revert back to tap-windows 9.21.2 due to driver getting reject on freshly installed Windows 10 rev 1607 and later when Secure Boot was enabled. The failure was due to the new, more strict driver signing requirements. The 9.22.1 version of the driver is in the process of getting approved and signed by Microsoft and will be bundled in an upcoming Windows installer.

Please note that LibreSSL is not a supported crypto backend. We accept patches and we do test on OpenBSD 6.0 which comes with LibreSSL, but if newer versions of LibreSSL break API compatibility we do not take responsibility to fix that.

Also note that Windows installers have been built with NSIS version that has been patched against several [NSIS installer code execution and privilege escalation problems](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NSISBug1125). Based on our testing, though, older Windows versions such as Windows 7 might not benefit from these fixes. *We thus strongly encourage you to always move NSIS installers to a non-user-writeable location before running them*. Our long-term plan is to migrate to using MSI installers instead.

Compared to OpenVPN 2.3 this is a major update with a large number of new features, improvements and fixes. Some of the major features are AEAD (GCM) cipher and Elliptic Curve DH key exchange support, improved IPv4/IPv6 dual stack support and more seamless connection migration when client's IP address changes (Peer-ID). Also, the new --tls-crypt feature can be used to increase users' connection privacy.

You can use [EasyRSA 2](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa-old) or [EasyRSA 3](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) for generating your own certificate authority. The former is bundled with Windows installers. The latter is a more modern alternative for UNIX-like operating systems.

The Windows installers are bundled with OpenVPN-GUI - its source code is available on [its project page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openvpn-gui/) and as tarballs on our [alternative download server](https://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/).

##### Windows Development snapshots

You can download Windows developments snapshots (MSI installers) from here ([Index of /downloads/snapshots/github-actions/openvpn2/](https://build.openvpn.net/downloads/snapshots/github-actions/openvpn2/) ). Those are automatically built from commits to OpenVPN master branch and include functionality which will be available in the next release. Development snapshots are less stable than releases, so use at your own risk.
