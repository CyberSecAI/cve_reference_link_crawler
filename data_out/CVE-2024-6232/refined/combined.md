Subject: CPython: [CVE-2024-6232] Regular-expression DoS when parsing TarFile
 headers

The CVE record currently says:
  Versions: affected from 0 before 3.13.0rc2

and points to <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121285> which provides
this slightly expanded description:

"Today the tarfile module parsing of header values allows for backtracking
  when parsing header values. Headers have a well-known format that doesn't
  require backtracking to parse reliably, the new method of parsing will only
  require a single pass over a byte stream."

and has links to pull requests for Python versions 3.8 through 3.13.

-------- Forwarded Message --------
Subject: 	[Security-announce][CVE-2024-6232] Regular-expression DoS when parsing
TarFile headers
Date: 	Tue, 3 Sep 2024 07:30:02 -0500
From: 	Seth Larson <seth@...hon.org>
Reply-To: 	security-sig@...hon.org
To: 	security-announce@...hon.org

There is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython.

Regular expressions that allowed excessive backtracking during tarfile.TarFile
header parsing are vulnerable to ReDoS via specifically-crafted tar archives.

| Bug description: Today the `tarfile` module parsing of header values allows for backtracking when parsing header values. Headers have a well-known format that doesn't require backtracking to parse reliably, the new method of parsing will only require a single pass over a byte stream.

### **[frenzymadness](/frenzymadness)** commented [Sep 4, 2024](#issuecomment-2328766726)

| The CVE description contains:  Regular expressions that allowed excessive backtracking during tarfile.TarFile header parsing are vulnerable to ReDoS via specifically-crafted tar archives.  but the test added to verify the fix does not cause/test the ReDoS. I mean, when you run the test with unpatched Python, it raises `tarfile.ReadError` as well just with a different message, for example:  ``` tarfile.ReadError: file could not be opened successfully: - method gz: ReadError('not a gzip file') - method bz2: ReadError('not a bzip2 file') - method xz: ReadError('not an lzma file') - method tar: ReadError('bad checksum')  ```  Could you please help me understand how one of the regexes (fox example: `br"(\d+) ([^=]+)="`) can cause a regex backtracking? There is no combination of greedy nested quatifiers, greedy quantifiers are limited by the character class and I don't see a need for the regex algorithm to go back and consider another path if the match is not found. |

| [@frenzymadness](https://github.com/frenzymadness) Apologies for the confusion, not all of the regular expressions in the PR have issues with backtracking. The regex you mention was replaced to process the entire tar header block in one pass rather than multiple passes. |
