Subject: CPython: [CVE-2024-6232] Regular-expression DoS when parsing TarFile
 headers

The CVE record currently says:
  Versions: affected from 0 before 3.13.0rc2

and points to <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121285> which provides
this slightly expanded description:

"Today the tarfile module parsing of header values allows for backtracking
  when parsing header values. Headers have a well-known format that doesn't
  require backtracking to parse reliably, the new method of parsing will only
  require a single pass over a byte stream."

and has links to pull requests for Python versions 3.8 through 3.13.

TarFile headers

There is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython.

Regular expressions that allowed excessive backtracking during tarfile.TarFile
header parsing are vulnerable to ReDoS via specifically-crafted tar archives.
