{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `download.php` script in AChecker does not properly validate the `path` parameter, allowing an attacker to download arbitrary files from the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "Lack of proper validation of user-supplied file paths.",
      "Unrestricted access to files within the server's file system."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server's file system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, source code, or user data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By manipulating the `path` parameter in the URL.",
      "Providing a file path outside of the intended export directory `AC_EXPORT_RPT_DIR`."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `download.php` script.",
          "The attacker needs to know the file path on the server in order to download it."
      ]
