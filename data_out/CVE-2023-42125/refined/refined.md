- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the implementation of the sandbox feature in Avast Premium Security. It can be exploited by creating a symbolic link that allows an attacker to abuse the service and create arbitrary namespace objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the improper handling of symbolic links within the sandbox feature, leading to arbitrary namespace object creation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker needs to first gain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system and then create a specific symbolic link to abuse the Avast service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have initial low-privileged code execution on the target system.
