- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Google Docs RSVP plugin for WordPress versions <= 2.0.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while authenticated. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, can execute unwanted actions within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into executing a malicious request. The attacker does not require authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
