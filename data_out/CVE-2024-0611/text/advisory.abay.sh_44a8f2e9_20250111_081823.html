# CVE-2024-0611 — Master Slider – Responsive Touch Slider < 3.9.5 Editor+ Stored Cross-Site Scritpting via Slider Callback

  Mar 01, 2024   Mar 01, 2024  abay

The Master Slider – Responsive Touch Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the slides callback functionality in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

The Master Slider – Responsive Touch Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the slides callback functionality in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

This plugin provides a feature to customize Slider Callbacks via script (javascript). I know that the admin could just enter `alert(\\xss\\)` and this report would not be in scope. However, this plugin requires certain conditions that trigger this script, such as “On slider Init” or “On Youtube/Vimeo video close”.

### Proof of Concepts

1. Go to the plugin page (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=master-slider) then create a new slider.
2. Open the Slider that you have created then go to the Slider Callbacks tab
3. Click “Add new callback” with any conditions (ex: On Youtube/Vimeo video close), then enter the XSS payload.
   ```
   function(event){
    var api = event.target;
    </script><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
   }

   ```
4. Create a new Post using the shortcode for the slider that has been created

If we directly use `alert(\xss\)`, the XSS payload will not be triggered because it does not meet the required conditions. However, we bypass this condition using the closing script (`</script>`).

### Impact

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
