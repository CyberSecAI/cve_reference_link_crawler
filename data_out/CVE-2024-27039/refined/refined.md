Based on the provided information, all the commits relate to the same vulnerability fix:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An erroneous `devm_kfree()` call in the `hisi_clk_register_pll` function within the HiSilicon clock driver for the hi3559a SoC.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code iterates through an array of clocks (`p_clk`) to register.  If the registration fails for any particular clock, `devm_kfree(dev, p_clk)` is called. However, `p_clk` is incremented in each loop iteration, and thus, on failure, `p_clk` may point to an incorrect memory location, leading to a double free or memory corruption when calling `devm_kfree()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is a potential kernel crash, due to a double free or memory corruption. This can lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered within the clock registration process, during the initialization of the device. It doesn't appear to be user-triggered directly, but rather a result of how the kernel attempts to initialize the clocks during the boot process or during runtime (e.g. enabling/disabling devices).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would not directly trigger this vulnerability through normal means. They would have to manipulate the system in such a way as to cause the clock registration to fail which would then expose the memory corruption issue.
