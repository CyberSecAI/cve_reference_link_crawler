Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically the `username` field in the `login.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
- The application uses plain SQL queries instead of prepared statements, which exacerbates the SQL injection risk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically boolean-based blind SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
- An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
- The attacker can dump the entire database including usernames and password hashes
- The attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to further compromise of the system or other connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `username` parameter in the login form of the web application.
- The attack vector is via HTTP POST request to the `/foms/login.php` endpoint, specifically to `router.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection is required, and tools like `sqlmap` can be used to automate exploitation.
