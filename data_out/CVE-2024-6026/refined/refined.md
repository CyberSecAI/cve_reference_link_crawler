- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape slide options, specifically the "Link the slide to:" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser when they view the affected slider. This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user with Editor+ level permissions or higher can add a malicious script to the "Link the slide to:" field of a slide and add CSS in the main settings of new slider.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have an account with Editor+ privileges on the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
    - The attacker needs to have access to the slider functionality.
