In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vt_ioctl: fix array_index_nospec in vt_setactivate

array_index_nospec ensures that an out-of-bounds value is set to zero
on the transient path. Decreasing the value by one afterwards causes
a transient integer underflow. vsa.console should be decreased first
and then sanitized with array_index_nospec.
