The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48804.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of `array_index_nospec` in the `vt_setactivate` function within the Linux kernel's virtual terminal driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `array_index_nospec` function is intended to sanitize an array index, ensuring that an out-of-bounds value is reset to zero. However, in the vulnerable code, the index was first sanitized and then decremented. This order of operations leads to a transient integer underflow if the sanitized value was initially zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The integer underflow could potentially lead to out-of-bounds memory access. This could allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when a user calls the `vt_setactivate` ioctl with a console number that leads to the underflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable ioctl with a crafted console number. This requires a local user with the ability to interact with the virtual terminal subsystem.
