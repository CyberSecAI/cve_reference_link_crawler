Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the T3 protocol within Oracle WebLogic Server. Specifically, crafted data within a T3 protocol message can trigger the deserialization of untrusted data. This deserialization of untrusted data is the root cause for remote code execution.
* The vulnerability exists within the Oracle Coherence library due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of data received via the T3 protocol, leading to the deserialization of malicious data.
*   Improper validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Oracle WebLogic Server.
*   The attacker can execute code in the context of the service account, implying they may gain the privileges of the account running the vulnerable service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **T3 Protocol:** The specific attack vector involves sending crafted data within a T3 protocol message to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target Oracle WebLogic server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the WebLogic server, which increases the attack surface and severity.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Oracle Coherence library.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Oracle and subsequently patched.
*   CVSS score of 9.8
*   The vulnerability is present in versions 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.4.0 of Oracle WebLogic Server.
