# Detection: Splunk XSS in Highlighted JSON Events

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 1030bc63-0b37-4ac9-9ae0-9361c955a3cc
Author: Rod Soto, Splunk
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following analytic identifies potential exploitation of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise 9.1.2. It detects suspicious requests to the Splunk web GUI that may execute JavaScript within script tags. This detection leverages logs from the `splunkd_ui` data source, focusing on specific URI paths and HTTP methods. This activity is significant as it can allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript, potentially accessing the API with the logged-in user's permissions. If the user is an admin, the attacker could create an admin account, leading to full control over the Splunk environment.

### Search

```
1`splunkd_ui` "/*/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/authentication/users" status=201
2| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by clientip, uri_path, method
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_xss_in_highlighted_json_events_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_xss\_in\_highlighted\_json\_events\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_xss_in_highlighted_json_events_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

This search only applies to web-GUI-enabled Splunk instances and operator must have access to internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and will produce false positives as it is not possible to view contents of a request payload. It shows the artifact resulting from a potential exploitation payload (the creation of a user with admin privileges).

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible XSS exploitation from $clientip$ | 15 | 30 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
