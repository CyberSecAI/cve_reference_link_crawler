- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm in FortiSIEM. Specifically, the use of outdated hashing methods.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of weak or outdated hashing methods that are susceptible to brute-force attacks. This falls under CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can conduct brute-force attacks on GUI endpoints, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated attacker can attempt to brute force login credentials for FortiSIEM GUI endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable FortiSIEM instance. No special privileges or access to the network other than basic network connectivity are required.
