|  | [Suggested description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | An issue was discovered in casdoor v1.636.0. The usage of the |
|  | ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey() disables host key verification, possibly |
|  | allowing attackers to obtain sensitive information via a |
|  | man-in-the-middle attack. |
|  |  |
|  | In casdoor/casdoor/object/viaSSHDialer.go, |
|  | the InsecureIgnoreHostKey() method is used when establishing SSH |
|  | connections. This method disables host key checking, effectively |
|  | ignoring any potential discrepancies between the expected and |
|  | actual host keys. This practice can lead to similar security |
|  | risks as with TLS verification, such as enabling MITM attacks |
|  | by allowing attackers to impersonate the intended server. |
