Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41038:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A specially crafted `SET BIND` statement with a large `CHAR` type can cause stack corruption. The vulnerability arises when a `VARCHAR` type is bound to a `CHAR` type with a significantly larger length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
