# Server crash when using specific form of SET BIND statement

Moderate

[AlexPeshkoff](/AlexPeshkoff)
published
GHSA-6fv8-8rwr-9692
Mar 20, 2024

## Package

Firebird SQL server

## Affected versions

4.0.0 - 4.0.3, 5.0 beta1

## Patched versions

4.0.4.2981 or higher, 5.0.0.1176 or higher

## Description

### Impact

It appears suspicious that such binding may be used occasionally with any purpose except crashing server. On the other hand any non-privileged user with minimum access to server may type

SET BIND OF VARCHAR(252) TO CHAR(1024) CHARACTER SET WIN1251 --(critical is big length of CHAR type)

that will cause server die immediately due to stack corruption.

### Patches

Fixed snapshots are available at <https://firebirdsql.org/en/snapshot-builds/> .

### Workarounds

No - upgrade is required.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-41038

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
