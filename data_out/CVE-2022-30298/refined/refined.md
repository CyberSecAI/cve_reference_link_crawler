- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by improper privilege management (CWE-269) in FortiSOAR. A GUI user who has already found a way to modify system files can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user with the ability to modify system files can execute arbitrary Python commands as root, leading to a privilege escalation from the nginx user to root.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. The attacker must first gain the ability to modify system files through a separate, unrelated exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a GUI user that has already found a way to modify system files.
