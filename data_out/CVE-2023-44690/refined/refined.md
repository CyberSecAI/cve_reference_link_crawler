- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The mycli project uses AES in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode for encrypting configuration data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** AES ECB mode is used, which is known to be insecure because it does not provide diffusion. Identical plaintext blocks will produce identical ciphertext blocks, leading to pattern repetition, which is vulnerable to attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information leakage and compromise of the confidentiality of sensitive data stored within mycli configurations.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially analyze patterns in the encrypted configuration data to infer the underlying plaintext data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need access to the encrypted configuration data and knowledge of the encryption method (AES ECB).

The content also mentions that this vulnerability is potentially a false positive because mycli implements a format defined by MySQL which also uses AES ECB. The maintainers were advised to dispute the CVE.
