### @alpernae **[alpernae](/alpernae)** commented [Jul 4, 2024](#issue-2389712287) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

# Description

This pull request includes security updates and patches to address recently discovered vulnerability by [@alpernae](https://github.com/alpernae). The changes aim to enhance the overall security of the application and ensure safe usage for all users.

Vulnerable Filename: <https://github.com/stitionai/devika/blob/main/devika.py>

Vulnerable Line: between 123/127

Vulnerable Endpoint;

```
@app.route("/api/get-browser-snapshot", methods=["GET"])
@route_logger(logger)
def browser_snapshot():
    snapshot_path = request.args.get("snapshot_path")
    return send_file(snapshot_path, as_attachment=True)

```

Patch:

```

# Security Update!!
@app.route("/api/get-browser-snapshot", methods=["GET"])
@route_logger(logger)
def browser_snapshot():
    # TO-DO: Update allowed paths
    allowed_paths = ["/path/to/snapshots/file1.png", "/path/to/snapshots/file2.jpg"]
    snapshot_path = request.args.get("snapshot_path")
    if snapshot_path in allowed_paths:
        return send_file(snapshot_path, as_attachment=True)
    else:
        return jsonify({"code":403,"reason": "Forbidden Path"}), 403

```
## Security Vulnerability Fix:

* **Path Traversal Prevention**:
  + Implemented stricter validation for file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks.
  + Ensured that only files within the allowed directory can be accessed.
  + Added checks to sanitize and validate the `snapshot_path` parameter.

Sorry, something went wrong.
