{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Thingsboard handles version control operations, specifically when interacting with Git repositories. It appears that the application allows for the creation of symlinks within the Git repository, and during the cloning/checkout process, these symlinks are followed, leading to arbitrary file writes on the server's filesystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Write",
      "Insecure handling of symlinks",
      "Insufficient input validation during Git operations"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create or modify arbitrary files on the server, potentially including webroot files, registry entries, and other sensitive system files. This can lead to complete control over the host, allowing the attacker to execute malicious code, steal sensitive data, or cause denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploiting the AdvancedFeature -> Version Control functionality in Thingsboard.",
         "The attacker needs to have access to the tenant admin account within Thingsboard",
        "Manipulating a Git repository with malicious symlinks"
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a tenant admin within the Thingsboard application. They also need a Git repository under their control, where they can create a malicious symlink."
