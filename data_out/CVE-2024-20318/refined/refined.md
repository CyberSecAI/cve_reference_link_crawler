- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of specific Ethernet frames received on line cards with the Layer 2 services feature enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of specific Ethernet frames leading to a network processor reset.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the ingress interface network processor to reset, leading to loss of traffic. Multiple resets can cause the entire line card to reset, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specific crafted Ethernet frames through an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the vulnerable device, and does not require authentication.
