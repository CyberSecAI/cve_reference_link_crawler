| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR Software Layer 2 Services Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-xrl2vpn-jesrU3fc  First Published: 2024 March 13 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwe29150](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe29150)     CVE-2024-20318     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20318     CWE-20       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xrl2vpn-jesrU3fc/csaf/cisco-sa-xrl2vpn-jesrU3fc.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Layer 2 Ethernet services of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the line card network processor to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of specific Ethernet frames that are received on line cards that have the Layer 2 services feature enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific Ethernet frames through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ingress interface network processor to reset, resulting in a loss of traffic over the interfaces that are supported by the network processor. Multiple resets of the network processor would cause the line card to reset, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xrl2vpn-jesrU3fc>  This advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75299).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software and have an affected Layer 2 transport configuration enabled:    + ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers that have a Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card installed   + ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers   + ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers   + IOS XRd vRouters   + IOS XRv 9000 Routers For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine the Installed Line Cards**  To determine which line cards are installed in a device, use the **show platform** CLI command.  The following line cards are Lightspeed-based:    + A9K-16X100GE-TR   + A99-16X100GE-X-SE   + A99-32X100GE-TR The following line cards are Lightspeed-Plus-based:    + A9K-4HG-FLEX-SE   + A9K-4HG-FLEX-TR   + A9K-8HG-FLEX-SE   + A9K-8HG-FLEX-TR   + A9K-20HG-FLEX-SE   + A9K-20HG-FLEX-TR   + A99-4HG-FLEX-SE   + A99-4HG-FLEX-TR   + A99-10X400GE-X-SE   + A99-10X400GE-X-TR   + A99-32X100GE-X-SE   + A99-32X100GE-X-TR For more information about line card type identification, see [Understand ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html).  **Note:** At the time of publication, the lists of Cisco Lightspeed and Lightspeed-Plus product identifiers (PIDs) were accurate. For specific questions and further clarification about a PID, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).  **Determine the Layer 2 Transport Configuration**  To determine if a device has an affected Layer 2 transport configuration, do the following steps:    1. Use the **show running-configuration** command.   2. Look for **rewrite ingress tag pop** on the l2transport interface in the output, as shown in the following example: ```      !interface HundredGigE0/0/0/12.1 l2transport encapsulation dot1q 2500 rewrite ingress tag pop 1 symmetric!      ``` If **rewrite ingress tag pop** is not present in the output, the device is not vulnerable.   3. If **rewrite ingress tag pop** is present in the output, determine whether either of the following are present on the device:      + **load-balancing flow src-dst-ip** is present under the l2vpn configuration, as shown in the following example: ```        l2vpnrouter-id 1.1.1.1load-balancing flow src-dst-ip        ```      + A service policy or access-control filtering mechanism that examines the IP headers is applied on the Layer 2 interfaces.If either the configuration or the policy is present on the device, the device is vulnerable.   Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR Platforms that are not listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  As a mitigation, either remove **load-balancing flow src-dst-ip**, if configured, or change the service policies so they do not examine the IP header.  While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased.
