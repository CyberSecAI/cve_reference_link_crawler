The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), and it includes CVE-2024-26095.

**CVE-2024-26095**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and then executed when a user views the affected page.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L). An attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), and requires user interaction (UI:R).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a low-privileged user who can inject malicious script into the system. The victim needs to interact with the injected script by clicking or accessing the malicious content.

In summary, CVE-2024-26095 is a stored XSS vulnerability that could allow a low-privileged attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by injecting a malicious payload, which would be executed when a user interacts with the crafted content.
