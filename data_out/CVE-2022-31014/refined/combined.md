# SMTP Command Injection in iCalendar Attachments to emails via newlines

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-264h-3v4w-6xh2
Jul 4, 2022

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 22.2.8, < 23.0.5, < 24.0.1

## Patched versions

22.2.8, 23.0.5, 24.0.1

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

<19.0.13.7, <20.0.14.6, <21.0.9.5, <22.2.8, <23.0.5

19.0.13.7, 20.0.14.6, 21.0.9.5, 22.2.8, 23.0.5

## Description

### Impact

The impact varies based on which commands are supported by the backend SMTP server. However, the main risk here is that the attacker can then hijack an already-authenticated SMTP session and run arbitrary SMTP commands as the email user, such as sending emails to other users, changing the FROM user, and so on. As before, this depends on the configuration of the server itself, but newlines should be sanitized to mitigate such arbitrary SMTP command injection.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.8 , 23.0.5 or 24.0.1.

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 19.0.13.7, 20.0.14.6, 21.0.9.5, 22.2.8 or 23.0.5.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID
