{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format strings based on user-supplied input without proper size checks, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted network packets to trigger vulnerable `DetranCLI` commands.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send a sequence of requests to the device's `DetranCLI` interface. The attacker needs to have a high level of privilege as indicated by the CVSS score (PR:H)"
