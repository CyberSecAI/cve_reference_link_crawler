Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

**Affected Software:** WordPress WP Job Portal Plugin <= 2.1.8

**Root Cause:** The plugin is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). This means that the plugin uses direct references to internal implementation objects without performing sufficient authorization checks.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The core weakness is the use of direct object references without proper authorization. This allows an attacker to manipulate these references to access or modify objects they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypassing authorization:** An attacker can potentially bypass authorization checks, gaining access to resources or functionality they are not permitted to use.
*   **Accessing sensitive files/folders:** Depending on the specific implementation, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive files and folders.
*  **Database interaction:** Attackers might be able to interact with the database in an unauthorized way, potentially viewing or manipulating data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Object Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate object references (likely IDs in URL parameters or forms) to access or modify resources belonging to other users or with higher privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Subscriber Level Access:** The attacker only needs the access level of a subscriber on the WordPress site, which is a low-level user role.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a **low** priority and a CVSS score of **5.4**.
*   The vulnerability is classified under **OWASP Top 10 - A1: Broken Access Control**.
*   The fix is available in version **2.1.9**.
*   The report was published by Patchstack on August 14, 2024 and the vulnerability was reported by LuxF0z on June 5th 2024.
