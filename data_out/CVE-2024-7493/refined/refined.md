- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPCOM Member plugin allows arbitrary data to be passed to the `wp_insert_user()` function during user registration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege management, specifically, the ability for an attacker to directly influence the user role assigned to a new user during registration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can register new user accounts with administrator privileges, leading to complete site takeover.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, exploiting the user registration functionality of the WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin. No prior authentication is required.
