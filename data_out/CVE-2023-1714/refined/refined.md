Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2023-1714:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the unsafe extraction of user options in `bitrix/modules/main/classes/general/user_options.php` within Bitrix24. Specifically, the application incorrectly assumes that values returned by `CUserOptions::GetOption` cannot be controlled by an attacker, which leads to multiple exploitation vectors.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Remote Command Execution (RCE) via Insecure File Appending:**
    *   **Weakness:** The `Export` controller allows an attacker to control the `filePath` property through user options. This property is used in the `writeTempFile` function, which opens the file in append mode and writes attacker-controlled exported data to it.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By manipulating user options, an authenticated attacker can set the `filePath` to a PHP file and append arbitrary PHP code via the export functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated user account with access to CRM functionalities to create and export contacts.
2.  **Remote Command Execution (RCE) via PHAR Deserialization:**
    *   **Weakness:** The `file_exists` function in  `bitrix/components/bitrix/crm.contact.list/stexport.ajax.php` is called with an attacker-controlled path obtained from user options. When Bitrix is run with PHP <8, this allows for PHAR deserialization attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By setting the `FILE_PATH` user option with a `phar://` wrapper, a malicious `.phar` file can be loaded leading to remote code execution via PHP Object Injection. The vulnerability can be combined with an arbitrary file upload vulnerability to upload the malicious PHAR.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated user account with access to CRM functionalities to edit contact information (including uploading a profile picture).

**Further details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of an attacker to manipulate their own user options, which are then used in the code. This is achieved by setting a cookie named `BITRIX_SM_LAST_SETTINGS`.
*   The attacker can control the `filePath` in the file append vulnerability and `FILE_PATH` in the PHAR deserialization vulnerability by setting appropriate values in the `BITRIX_SM_LAST_SETTINGS` cookie.
*   Both vulnerabilities exploit the same root cause - the ability to control the values returned by `CUserOptions::GetOption`.
*   The provided content contains detailed proof of concept (PoC) exploit code (Python scripts) for both vulnerabilities.
*   The PHAR deserialization exploit uses a polyglot file (PHAR/JPG), to bypass checks on the validity of the uploaded image.
*   A detailed timeline of the communication with the vendor is also provided.
