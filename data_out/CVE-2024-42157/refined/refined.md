The provided content relates to a vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel's s390/pkey driver. The vulnerability is caused by sensitive data not being wiped from the stack when `copy_to_user()` fails during an ioctl operation.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause:**
- Sensitive data related to cryptographic keys or parameters was being copied to user space using `copy_to_user()`. If this operation failed, the sensitive data remained on the kernel stack.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **Information Leakage:** Failure to wipe the sensitive data from the kernel stack after a failed `copy_to_user()` call could potentially allow an attacker to leak this data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive cryptographic keys or parameters if `copy_to_user` fails and they can access the kernel stack. This could lead to further compromise depending on what the keys were used for.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to trigger a situation where the `copy_to_user()` call fails within the `pkey_unlocked_ioctl` function in the s390/crypto/pkey_api.c driver. This could be accomplished by attempting to copy a large amount of data to an invalid user space address, causing the `copy_to_user` operation to fail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to make `ioctl` calls to the `/dev/pkey` device. They likely need some level of access to the system where they can make these specific system calls.
- They would need to trigger a failure condition in the `copy_to_user` operation to prevent the data wipe.

**Additional notes**
- The fix involves changing the return statement for a failure of `copy_to_user()` to set the return code to `-EFAULT` and then calls `memzero_explicit` to wipe the stack memory before exiting the function
- The fix also includes several "Signed-off-by" tags indicating the proper process for patch submission has been followed.
- The commits indicate this issue affects the s390 architecture.

This information is more detailed than what would be typically present in a CVE description which tends to be more general.
