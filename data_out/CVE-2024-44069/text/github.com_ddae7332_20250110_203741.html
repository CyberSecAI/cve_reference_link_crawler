**What does this PR aim to accomplish?:**

There was a lack of a check to the $auth variable. This allowed any unauthenticated user to change the CPU temperature unit displayed of the pi-hole application. Adding the check of this variable fixes this issue.

The absence of authentication of this function was deemed not a security risk but maintainers were open to a potential merge depending on the release of v6.

Report: <https://github.com/pi-hole/web/security/advisories/GHSA-mffw-5jmg-9wjq>

**How does this PR accomplish the above?:**

Added `&& $auth` authorization check before using setTempUnit parameter to change temperature.

**Link documentation PRs if any are needed to support this PR:**
