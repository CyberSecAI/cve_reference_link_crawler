### [No support with pro](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-support-with-pro/)

DON’T PAY FOR THE PRO ADD-ON (Sola Testimonials). The plugin integration with pro is broken, and I’ve gotten no response to my request for help a week ago. I’ve paid for the pro, and it’s pretty much useless now. I’m on the hunt for a new plugin. It \*was\* a nice plugin. I got a whole 3 years of use out of it before it was abandoned. As far as I can tell, the free version still works, but what’s the point when I paid for more?

I was looking to change the links on the plug in from Nofollow to follow and the assistance I received from Dylan was nothing sort of top class. Very happy with our new testimonials page thanks to this plug in and assistance.
Highly recommended.

I have scoured the internet looking for the perfect testimonials plugin for WordPress that did what I needed it to. Apparently this was hard to accomplish! Luckily I found Sola Testimonials and it’s been 100% worth it since!
Thank you!

I wanted to keep my desktop website testimonials page in 3 columns for the look but just 1 column on mobile for mobile friendliness, and Sola support helped me with it. This plugin is really user-friendly, no complaints from me. [I purchased the pro version which had advanced features I wanted to use]
