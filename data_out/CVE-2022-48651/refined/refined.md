{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `skb->mac_header` is not reset under certain conditions when sending packets through ipvlan using an AF_PACKET socket with a modified xmit function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `packet_snd()` function only resets `skb->mac_header` when the socket type is `SOCK_RAW` and the `skb->protocol` is not specified.",
      "The `packet_direct_xmit()` function does not reset `skb->mac_header`, unlike `dev_queue_xmit()`."
    ],
    "impact": "A slab-out-of-bounds read occurs in `ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2()` when it tries to access the MAC header using `eth_hdr(skb)` with an invalid `skb->mac_header` value, leading to a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can exploit this by sending packets through an `AF_PACKET` socket using ipvlan.",
      "The attacker needs to change the default xmit function of the AF_PACKET socket from `dev_queue_xmit()` to `packet_direct_xmit()` using `setsockopt()` with the `PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS` option."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and configure `AF_PACKET` sockets and use the `setsockopt()` syscall to modify the socket's xmit function."
  },
  "resolution": "The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `eth_hdr()` with `skb_eth_hdr()` in `ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2()` and resetting the mac header in the multicast handling logic."
