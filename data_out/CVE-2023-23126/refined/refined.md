  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Connectwise Automate login screen does not implement proper frame protection mechanisms.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Clickjacking vulnerability due to the lack of frame protection (e.g., X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy headers)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can iframe the login screen and potentially manipulate users into performing unintended actions, such as logging into a malicious instance or other actions they would not normally authorize.",
  "Attack vectors": "Embedding the vulnerable login page within an iframe on a malicious website.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious website, and needs to be able to convince a user of Connectwise Automate to visit said site."
