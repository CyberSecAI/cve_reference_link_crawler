{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. Specifically, the file upload functionality within the Toshiba Multi-Function Printers (MFPs) does not properly sanitize or validate the provided file paths, allowing an attacker to manipulate file names and paths, resulting in path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload files to arbitrary locations on the file system, potentially overwriting critical system files or gaining code execution by uploading executable files.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the Toshiba MFPs, specifically the file upload functionality. The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request containing the file to upload and a crafted file path, exploiting a vulnerable API to place the file outside the intended directory.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Toshiba MFP and the ability to craft HTTP requests. No prior authentication is required for some vulnerable endpoints."
