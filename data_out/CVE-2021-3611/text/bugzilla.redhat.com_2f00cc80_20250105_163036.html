| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-18 17:11:44 UTC  ``` A KVM guest can crash qemu-kvm (likely with a stack overflow) when the guest has been started with the intel-hda device. According to the upstream ticket, the crash is due to a stack overflow.  References: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1907497](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/1907497) <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/542>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-22 17:56:03 UTC  ``` This issue was apparently introduced in QEMU upstream version 5.0.0 with commit a9d8ba2b:  $ git tag --contains a9d8ba2be58e067bdfbff830eb9ff438d8db7f10 | head -1 v5.0.0   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-24 14:18:13 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1975833](show_bug.cgi?id=1975833 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3611 qemu: intel-hda: segmentation fault due to stack overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-30 20:36:19 UTC  ``` This bug turned out to be a manifestation of a well-known problem ("DMA reentrancy") whose resolution has yet to be found. QEMU upstream is aware of this issue.
