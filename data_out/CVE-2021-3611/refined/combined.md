### hw/audio/intel-hda: Restrict DMA engine to memories (not MMIO devices)

```

Issue [#542](/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/542 "Stack-overflow in ldl_le_dma through intel-hda (CVE-2021-3611)") reports a reentrancy problem when the DMA engine accesses
the HDA controller I/O registers. Fix by restricting the DMA engine
to memories regions (forbidding MMIO devices such the HDA controller).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-18 17:11:44 UTC  ``` A KVM guest can crash qemu-kvm (likely with a stack overflow) when the guest has been started with the intel-hda device. According to the upstream ticket, the crash is due to a stack overflow.  References: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1907497](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/1907497) <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/542>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-22 17:56:03 UTC  ``` This issue was apparently introduced in QEMU upstream version 5.0.0 with commit a9d8ba2b:  $ git tag --contains a9d8ba2be58e067bdfbff830eb9ff438d8db7f10 | head -1 v5.0.0   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-24 14:18:13 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1975833](show_bug.cgi?id=1975833 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3611 qemu: intel-hda: segmentation fault due to stack overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-30 20:36:19 UTC  ``` This bug turned out to be a manifestation of a well-known problem ("DMA reentrancy") whose resolution has yet to be found. QEMU upstream is aware of this issue. For additional details, see:  * [https://patchew.org/QEMU/20200903110831.353476-1-philmd@redhat.com](https://patchew.org/QEMU/20200903110831.353476-1-philmd%40redhat.com) * <https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-09/msg00906.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c10)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-09-19 21:55:13 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/79fa99831debc9782087e834382c577215f2f511>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-11-15 09:49:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2022:7967 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7967](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A7967)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1973784#c12)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-12-04 22:41:05 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

```
The qemu device fuzzer has found several DMA to MMIO issue.
These issues is caused by the guest driver programs the DMA
address, then in the device MMIO handler it trigger the DMA
and as the DMA address is MMIO it will trigger another dispatch
and reenter the MMIO handler again. However most of the device
is not reentrant.

DMA to MMIO will cause issues depend by the device emulator,
mostly it will crash the qemu. Following is three classic
DMA to MMIO issue.

e1000e: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1886362](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/1886362)
xhci: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1891354](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/1891354)
virtio-gpu: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1888606](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/1888606)

The DMA to MMIO issue I think can be classified as following:
1. DMA to the device itself
2. device A DMA to device B and to device C
3. device A DMA to device B and to device A

The first case of course should not be allowed.
The second case I think it ok as the device IO handler has no
assumption about the IO data came from no matter it come from
device or other device. This is for P2P DMA.
The third case I think it also should not be allowed.

So our issue has been reduced by one case: not allowed the
device's IO handler reenter.

Paolo suggested that we can refactor the device emulation with
BH. However it is a lot of work.
I have thought several propose to address this, also discuss
this with Jason Wang in private email.

I have can solve this issue in core framework or in specific device.
After try several methods I choose address it in per-device for
following reason:
1. If we address it in core framwork we have to recored and check the
device or MR info in MR dispatch write function. Unfortunally we have
no these info in core framework.
2. The performance will also be decrease largely
3. Only the device itself know its IO

The (most of the) device emulation is protected by BQL one time only
a device emulation code can be run. We can add a flag to indicate the
IO is running. The first two patches does this. For simplicity at the
RFC stage I just set it while enter the IO callback and clear it exit
the IO callback. It should be check/set/clean according the per-device's
IO emulation.
The second issue which itself suffers a race condition so I uses a
atomic.

Li Qiang (3):
  e1000e: make the IO handler reentrant
  xhci: make the IO handler reentrant
  virtio-gpu: make the IO handler reentrant
