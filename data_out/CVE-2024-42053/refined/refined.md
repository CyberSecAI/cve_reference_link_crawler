- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Splashtop Streamer MSI installer uses a temporary folder with weak permissions during installation, specifically when a reinstall is triggered. During the reinstall process, an executable attempts to load a DLL (version.dll) from a user-writable folder in the user's %TEMP% directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the use of a user-writable temporary folder with insufficient access controls when loading a DLL, specifically version.dll. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in the userâ€™s %TEMP% directory with the same name which will then get executed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local authenticated user can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM by placing a malicious DLL in the temporary directory. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires the attacker to be an authenticated user on the system. The attacker needs to force a reinstall of the Splashtop Streamer application either by having access to the original MSI installer or being able to copy it back to its original location. They then place a malicious `version.dll` in the user's `%TEMP%` folder to be loaded during the reinstall process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local, authenticated user on the system where Splashtop Streamer is installed. They must also be able to trigger a reinstall of the Splashtop Streamer application and have the ability to create files in the user's %TEMP% directory.
