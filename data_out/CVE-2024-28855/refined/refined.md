The provided content relates to CVE-2024-28855.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `text/template` package instead of `html/template` package in ZITADEL's login UI rendering process, resulting in improper sanitization of input parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper HTML sanitization, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML code into the login screen.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious code, including JavaScript, into the login screen through crafted links. Although the Content Security Policy (CSP) prevents execution of injected scripts, the injected HTML could potentially be used for phishing or other malicious purposes by manipulating the look and feel of the login page.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, with the attacker creating a malicious link to inject code into the login page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute malicious links to users of the ZITADEL platform. User interaction is required as the user needs to click on the malicious link.
