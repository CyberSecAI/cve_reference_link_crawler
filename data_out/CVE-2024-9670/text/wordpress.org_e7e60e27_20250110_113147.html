### [Nice but only if you like purple](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/nice-but-only-if-you-like-purple/)

September 3, 2016

This is a nice tag cloud, one of the better looking ones I could find‚Ä¶ but only if you like purple. It seems nigh on impossible to change the colours. There is a nice interface for setting the colours, but it appears to do absolutely nothing. Every time I save my changes, it goes back to default purple colours.
I‚Äôm going to dig around in the code to see if I can work out where the colours are being set so that I can manually change these myself, but it would be nice if the settings panel actually worked.

Is the best tagcloud plugin available, but can not configure well. Please update the plugin to the last wp version and fix some errors. Can not save the configuration, the tags only works in the default color and size, can not do nothing more. If u fix this I will review and will give the 5 stars.Thanks
