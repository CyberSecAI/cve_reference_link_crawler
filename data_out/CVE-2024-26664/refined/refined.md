Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26664:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-26664. The commit messages and code diffs explicitly mention "hwmon: (coretemp) Fix out-of-bounds memory access" and "Fix a bug that pdata->cpu_map[] is set before out-of-bounds check."  This aligns with the description of the vulnerability as an out-of-bounds memory access issue in the coretemp driver.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `coretemp` driver allocates and uses the `pdata->cpu_map[]` array. Specifically:
   - The code allocated an index to map to a core, and then populated `pdata->cpu_map[index]` with the topology core id, *before* checking if the calculated `attr_no` (which is derived from the index) would result in an out-of-bounds write to `pdata->cpu_map[]`.
   - On systems with more than 128 cores per package, the allocated index could lead to `attr_no` exceeding the bounds of the `MAX_CORE_DATA` array causing the out of bounds write.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is that the code attempts to write to memory outside the allocated bounds of the `pdata->cpu_map[]` array.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Memory corruption:** An out-of-bounds write can overwrite adjacent memory, leading to unpredictable behavior and potentially system instability or crashes.
   - **Potential denial of service (DoS):**  Memory corruption can cause the kernel to malfunction, potentially leading to a system crash and a denial of service.
  - **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While not explicitly stated in the provided information, uncontrolled out-of-bounds writes can potentially be used for privilege escalation if an attacker can carefully control the data and location of the overwrite.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Hardware configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered when the system has a specific hardware configuration of more than 128 cores per package, exposing a larger `core_id` value.
   - **Driver initialization:** The vulnerability occurs during the initialization of the `coretemp` driver as it tries to map core ids and set up sysfs attributes, the allocation and access to `pdata->cpu_map[]` happens in `create_core_data`
   - **Core Enumeration:** The code uses the core topology and can be triggered when enumerating more than 128 cores per package.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker would need to be on a system with the vulnerable driver and hardware with more than 128 cores per package.
    -  The attacker would not need root privileges to trigger the vulnerability but it can cause system instability or crashes, and potentially be used to escalate privileges.

**Summary of the Fix:**

The fix involves changing how the `index` is allocated using `ida_alloc_max` instead of `ida_alloc`, which ensures that the allocated index is within a valid range. This prevents the out-of-bounds write by bounding the index to `NUM_REAL_CORES - 1`, which should prevent `attr_no` from exceeding the array bounds. The out-of-bounds check after allocation is removed as the allocation prevents this scenario. The fix is to ensure that `index` will be valid, and the code will not write out of bounds.
