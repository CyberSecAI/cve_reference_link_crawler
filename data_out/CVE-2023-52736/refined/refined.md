The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52736.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the premature unsetting of the `preset` field in the `snd_hda_codec` structure during codec cleanup (`snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind`). This function is re-used by ASoC codec drivers. The `preset` field is assigned during device/driver matching, and ASoC codec driver module reloading can occur multiple times. Unsetting the `preset` during cleanup can lead to a null-pointer dereference when the module is reloaded, especially in scenarios where ASoC sound cards are unbound without the codec device being removed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Premature unsetting of the `preset` pointer: The `codec->preset` field was being set to NULL in `snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind()` which is used in scenarios where the sound card is unbound but the codec is not removed, leading to a use-after-free when the module tries to reaccess the preset.
- Re-use of initialization/removal functions: The reuse of `snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind` by ASoC drivers created an unexpected scenario.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Null pointer dereference: The primary impact is a null-pointer dereference, which can lead to system instability or crashes during module reloading.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unloading and reloading of ASoC codec driver modules: The vulnerability is triggered by the unloading and reloading of the ASoC codec driver, which reuses the cleanup function of the HDA subsystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to unload and reload kernel modules: An attacker needs the ability to unload and reload kernel modules to trigger the vulnerability. This might require root privileges or specific system configurations.
