## Summary

An authenticated attacker with administrative access to the web management interface can inject malicious JavaScript code inside the definition of a Threat Intelligence rule, that will be stored and can later be executed by another legitimate user viewing the details of such a rule.

## Impact

Via stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), an attacker may be able to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users and/or gather sensitive information. JavaScript injection was possible in the contents for Yara rules, while limited HTML injection has been proven for packet and STYX rules.

## Affected Products

Guardian, CMC < v22.6.2

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Use internal firewall features to limit access to the web management interface.

## Solutions

Upgrade to v22.6.2 or later.
