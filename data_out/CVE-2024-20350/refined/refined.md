- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the presence of a static SSH host key in Cisco Catalyst Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a static SSH host key. This is a CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on SSH connections, intercept traffic, impersonate the Cisco Catalyst Center appliance, inject commands into the terminal session, and steal user credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept SSH connections between a client and the Cisco Catalyst Center appliance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a network position to perform a MitM attack. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is required.
