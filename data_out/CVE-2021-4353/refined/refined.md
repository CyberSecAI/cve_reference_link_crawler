Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-4353:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing authorization checks in the `export()` function of the WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discounts plugin. This function is triggered when the `rp_wcdpd_export_settings` parameter is present in the request. Due to this oversight, the function can be accessed by unauthenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication or capability checks before executing the `export` function. This allows any user, including those not logged in, to trigger the export of plugin settings.
*   **Unprotected Export Function:** The `export` function itself retrieves the plugin's settings directly from the database and sends them as a JSON file, without proper access control.
*   **Potential for Stored XSS:** While this specific vulnerability focuses on settings export, the content mentions that an unauthenticated settings import vulnerability exists, and that allows for the injection of JavaScript code. This code would then execute on product pages within the WooCommerce store, due to the lack of sanitization of some fields when importing settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can export the plugin's settings.
*   **Stored XSS:** Using the settings import vulnerability, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings and execute it on the site's frontend. This could allow for actions such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the site's appearance or content.
    *   Stealing user information.
*   **Potential for other attacks:** The export settings could provide insights into the site configuration that an attacker could potentially use to perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerable `export` function by sending an HTTP request containing the `rp_wcdpd_export_settings` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special privileges on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
