    "root_cause": "A double-free vulnerability exists in the `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` function due to improper handling of memory allocation failures when resizing GIF image data. Specifically, if the `realloc` call returns a null pointer and attempts to free the `out` variable, leading to a double free.",
