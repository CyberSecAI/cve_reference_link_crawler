- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, a lack of proper authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions they are not supposed to be able to, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing unintended changes. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by a missing authorization check, meaning an attacker would need to find the specific function that lacks these checks and then find a way to trigger the vulnerable functionality without proper authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (unprivileged user).
