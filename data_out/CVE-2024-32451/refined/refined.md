- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Legal Pages plugin versions 1.4.2 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or control within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request that is triggered when a logged-in, higher-privileged user visits a malicious site or link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to induce a higher-privileged, logged-in user to unknowingly execute the crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim does.
