Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Pharmacy Management System version 1.0. Specifically, the `name`, `address`, and `doctor_address` parameters are not sanitized before being stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into vulnerable fields which gets stored in the database and is executed each time the affected page is accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Theft of Sensitive Information:** Credentials and other private data can be stolen.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could potentially elevate their privileges within the application.
- **Web Content Defacement/Manipulation:** The attacker can alter the appearance and content of the website.
- **Malicious redirection:** Users can be redirected to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests that inject malicious JavaScript into the affected input fields (`name`, `address`, `doctor_address` and `suppliers_name` parameters).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to submit crafted requests to the application, specifically to the customer update functionality. They do not need to be authenticated to perform the injection, but to observe the effects they will require access to the administration panel.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges and only need to be able to make a GET request to the vulnerable page, e.g. `/php/manage_medicine.php`.
