  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the ‘allow_meme_types’ function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute when users access the injected pages.",
  "Attack vectors": "By uploading a malicious SVG file through the ‘allow_meme_types’ function, which doesn't properly sanitize the input.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level permissions."
