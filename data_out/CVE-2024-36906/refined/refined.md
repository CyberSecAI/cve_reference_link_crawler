Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is that the ARM architecture does not clear stale stack poison when exiting the kernel during CPU idle (cpuidle).
- Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) instruments functions, placing poison on the stack shadow upon entry and removing it before returning. However, when CPUs enter deep sleep states during cpuidle, the kernel is exited through a path where these poisoned regions are not cleared. If the CPU loses context and returns via a cold path, these poisoned regions remain, causing false positives in KASAN during subsequent calls to instrumented functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stale Stack Poison:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of stale poison in the stack shadow memory. This poison is left behind by KASAN-instrumented functions during cpuidle exits.
- **Lack of Unpoisoning:** The ARM architecture lacks a mechanism to unpoison the stack when exiting through the cpuidle path, resulting in the stale poison issue.
- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** This stale poison leads to KASAN detecting a write to a poisoned memory region, which is actually a false positive and not a true out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   The immediate impact is a kernel crash due to the KASAN false positive. While not a security vulnerability in itself (no arbitrary code execution), it can cause denial of service.
-   The kernel will produce a "KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds" error and associated debug information, leading to system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   This isn't a traditional attack vector involving malicious input. Instead, the vulnerability is triggered by the normal kernel operations, specifically the CPU entering and exiting idle states.
-   The vulnerability occurs due to the interaction between KASAN and the CPU idle mechanism on ARM architecture.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker does not need specific capabilities or a special position. The vulnerability arises from a bug in how the kernel handles KASAN and CPU idle states on ARM.
-   This is an internal kernel issue. It is triggered by the normal operation of the operating system and does not require any specific malicious actions to trigger.

**Technical Details:**

- The bug occurs in `refresh_cpu_vm_stats.constprop.0` function, triggered from `tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick` during the idle process.
- The stack out-of-bounds write is detected by KASAN and reported as a write of size 164 bytes at a specific memory address (`c1d03d30`).
- The fix involves adding code to `arch/arm/kernel/sleep.S` to clear any stale poison from the idle thread for a CPU prior to bringing a CPU online. This unpoisoning is done using `kasan_unpoison_task_stack_below`.
- The fix is conditional on `CONFIG_KASAN` and `CONFIG_KASAN_STACK` being enabled.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes multiple commits that address the same root cause, which were likely backported/applied to different kernel versions. They all point to the same underlying issue of stale stack poison during cpuidle on ARM.

In summary, this is a kernel bug that causes a false KASAN report and a subsequent crash when the CPU enters and exits idle, due to stale stack poison. The fix involves ensuring that the stack is unpoisoned before bringing a CPU back online.
