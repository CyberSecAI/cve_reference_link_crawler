**Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected RUGGEDCOM CROSSBOW systems allow a privileged user to upload firmware files to the root installation directory of the system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:** The system does not properly validate or sanitize the file path and name during the firmware upload process, allowing a user to specify the target location, including the root installation directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   By replacing specific files, an attacker could tamper with the system's functionality.
*   The attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution by replacing executable files.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network-based attack.
*   Attacker uploads a malicious firmware file to the root directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have privileged access to the affected system.
