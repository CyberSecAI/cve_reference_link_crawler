Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists because the Cisco IOx application hosting environment does not perform a real path check on requested data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Path Traversal: The lack of real path validation allows an attacker to bypass intended directory access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Arbitrary Data Access: An attacker can read and write arbitrary data on the underlying host operating system.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code as `root` on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Symbolic Link Creation: The attacker must create a symbolic link within a deployed application.
- API Data Request: The attacker uses the API to request data, using the previously created symbolic link to access unintended locations on the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Authenticated Remote Access: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have remote access to the Cisco IOx application hosting environment.
- Ability to deploy and execute an application with the symbolic link: The attacker has to be able to deploy an application and execute it, so it is able to use the crafted symbolic link.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is not dependent on other vulnerabilities in the advisory.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Cyrille CHATRAS of Orange group and also found during internal security testing by X.B. of the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG).
- There are no workarounds, but disabling the IOx environment is a mitigation.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS base score of 5.5 and a CVSS vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N.
- This vulnerability impacts multiple Cisco platforms with vulnerable software releases.
- Fixed software is available for multiple platforms.
