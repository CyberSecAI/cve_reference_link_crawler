Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the command-line interpreter of several Fortinet products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-121:** Stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
- **Execute unauthorized commands:** The attacker can execute commands with the privileges of the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command-line interpreter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the command line interface of the affected products.
- **Specially crafted commands:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending commands that cause a buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated attacker:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the command line interpreter of the affected devices. The attacker likely requires login credentials for the device to send the exploit commands.
