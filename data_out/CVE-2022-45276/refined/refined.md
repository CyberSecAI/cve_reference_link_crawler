The provided content details a vulnerability in YJCMS, specifically an incorrect access control issue.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authentication checks when accessing the `user_edit.html` page. This allows an unauthenticated user to directly retrieve system user account information, including usernames and MD5-hashed passwords.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system allows direct access to sensitive information (user credentials) without proper authentication or authorization checks.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The `/index/user/user_edit.html` endpoint should not be accessible without proper authentication and authorization.
- **Password Storage:** While the passwords are MD5 hashed, MD5 is considered weak and can be easily cracked using rainbow tables.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** Attackers can obtain administrator credentials, leading to full control over the website.
- **Data Breach:** With administrator access, attackers can modify, steal, or delete sensitive data.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the website content.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers may use the compromised website to distribute malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to the vulnerable URL: `http://xxx.com/index/user/user_edit.html`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required. An attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL to exploit this issue.
