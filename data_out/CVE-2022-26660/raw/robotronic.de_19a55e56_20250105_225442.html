	<p>	
	RunAsRob, RunAsSpc and RunElevated use an extended validation code signing certificate to prevent code manipulation or injection.<br>
	AES encryption, debug protection, changing passwords, hidden algorithms and further security methods are implemented.<br>
	The tools need no internet connection. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Runas tools help in a lot of different workarounds and can make a system safer. <br>
	Reduce administrator privileges or update and patch a system and its environment in a simple way <br>
	to close a security hole fast and uncomplicated on a vulnerable system.<br>
	- Please note that running an application under another user context than the logged in user or reversible encryption, <br>
	which is needed for the option to start an application from an encrypted file, are often classified as unsafe. <br> 
	- Consider that processes running from the main process inherit permissions. This generally useful property can be unwanted in some cases. <br>
	- Use NTFS rights to make sure, that only authorized users have read or change rights to the authorized files and folders.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The more complex a software, the more disastrous mistakes can happen and the more trust you need to developer.<br>
	RunAsRob, RunAsSpc or RunElevated are small, with a clear architecture for an easy integration in Windows and its security architecture. <br>
	Combine the tools with Windows user groups, file and folder permissions, folder shares, central policies or active directory organization units, to set very detailed privileges.<br>	
	You don't need any training or another company for an integration of these tools.<br>
	Alternative software solutions come with their own privileged access management.<br> 	
	Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a strategy to protect organizations by controlling user privileges, credentials, software, its usage and its function.<br>
	See different PAM solutions on: <a href="https://robotronic.net/blogenPAM.html" title="Privileged Access Management">Privileged Access Management</a> <br>
	It is recommended to engage a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) for integration.<br> 
	</p>
	
	<p>	
	There is no secure system and you get no serious security warranty without exception from a security service provider.<br>
	See global IT outage on July 19th, 2024, caused by a large, well-known security company with low warranties for their own mistakes.<br>
	Take the responsibility into your own hands and figure out the best balance between security, usability, confidentiality, integrity and availability.<br>
	To find the best way, you need knowledge about the chance and risk of the applications you use. <br>
	RunAsRob, RunAsSpc and RunElevated are small, easy to understand and like a Swiss Army Knife, <br>
	with its extensive possibilities they can help to find a good solution.<br>

	Known security bugs
	</H2>
	<p>
	A universal encryption key is used in RunAsSpc 4.0
	</p>
	<p>
	<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26660" title="CVE Mitre">Specification on Mitre CVE-2022-26660</a> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	RunAsSpc Vers 4.0 uses a universal and recoverable encryption key. <br>
	In possession of a file encrypted by RunAsSpc, an attacker can recover the credentials that were used, because encryption key is universal.  <br>
	Recovery of the password used for encryption can be used for Identity theft and privilege escalation. <br>

	Solutions
	</p>
	<p>	
	<ul>
	<li>
	Patched since version 4.1. Keys are changing. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Modify the password after the job is done.
	</li>
	<li>
	We recommend not using critical credentials with far-reaching privileges in the encrypted file.
	<li>
	Use the further development RunAsRob without storing the credentials.
	</li>
	</ul>
