- **Root cause of vulnerability**: RunAsSpc version 4.0 uses a universal encryption key for encrypting files, meaning the key is the same across all installations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a universal and recoverable encryption key.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in possession of a file encrypted by RunAsSpc 4.0 can recover the credentials used for encryption, leading to potential identity theft and privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to obtain an encrypted file created by RunAsSpc 4.0.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to obtain an encrypted file and have the ability to perform the decryption based on the universal encryption key.
