The content is related to CVE-2023-43637.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `deriveVaultKey` function, prior to version 7.10, uses a flawed key derivation process. It merges a 32-byte randomly generated key with a hardcoded key ("foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo"), taking 16 bytes from each, resulting in the last 16 bytes of the generated vault key always being "arfoobarfoobarfo".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a hardcoded cryptographic key (`CWE-321`).
- Use of hardcoded credentials (`CWE-798`).
- Weak key generation due to predictable parts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The weakened vault key makes the system more vulnerable to attacks that rely on knowing or predicting the key, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass authentication and access sensitive data or system functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the affected system.
- The system must have been initialized before version 7.10 and then updated.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability does not exist for devices initialized on or after version 7.10.
- The provided CVSS score is 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The vulnerability is an authentication bypass (`CAPEC-115`).
- The affected product is EVE OS.
