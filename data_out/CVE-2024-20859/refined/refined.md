Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-20859:

**CVE-2024-20859: Improper access control vulnerability in FactoryCamera**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the `FactoryCamera` component. This allows unauthorized access to functionality that should be restricted.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is a lack of proper access control mechanisms within the `FactoryCamera` component. This means that access permissions and privileges for specific features are not properly enforced.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to take pictures without having the necessary permissions or privileges, potentially capturing sensitive images without user consent or knowledge.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is **local**, meaning the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the affected device. This could include malicious applications or other local attack vectors.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be in a position to execute code on the device. They must have a method of interacting with the `FactoryCamera` component without the required privileges or the usual level of access.

*   **Affected versions:** Android 12, 13, and 14.

*  **Mitigation:** The patch blocks function from official binary.

This SVE entry provides more detail than a typical CVE description, specifically in describing the attack vector as local and the nature of the impact being the ability to take pictures without privilege.
