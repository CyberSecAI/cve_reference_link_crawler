- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's logout functionality uses the `returnUrl` parameter to redirect the user after logout. This parameter is vulnerable to DOM-based redirection because the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the URL provided in the `returnUrl` parameter, allowing an attacker to control the redirection target.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DOM-based open redirection vulnerability. The application uses user-controlled data (the `returnUrl` parameter) to perform a redirection without proper validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to redirect a user to an arbitrary external domain, which can be used for phishing attacks. The attack can appear credible because it uses the legitimate application URL with a valid SSL certificate (if applicable), making it difficult for users to detect the malicious redirect.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a `returnUrl` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled domain. When a user clicks on this crafted URL or is redirected to it, they will be redirected to the attacker's site after logging out.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and have the victim user click on it or be redirected to it in order to exploit the vulnerability.
