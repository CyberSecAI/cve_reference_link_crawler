Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `com.rebuild.web.commons.FileDownloader#viewImg()` method. This method retrieves an image path and then performs a redirect based on the path, without proper sanitization or validation of the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **URL Redirection:** The system allows a user-controlled URL to be used in a redirect operation. This means an attacker can inject a malicious URL which is then used in a redirect.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not validate the image path before redirecting to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website by embedding a crafted URL in the image path. This could be used to steal credentials or distribute malware.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could potentially trick users into downloading malicious files by redirecting the download process to a malicious URL.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting a specific request to the `/feeds/post/publish` endpoint to insert a malicious URL within the image array. Then when a user clicks to download the file it redirects to the attacker controlled URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to create a new dynamic post or modify an existing one, and insert or modify image paths in the request to `/feeds/post/publish`. They must be able to intercept or manipulate the request and the `images` array to inject the malicious URL.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **Vulnerable Code:** The `com.rebuild.web.commons.FileDownloader#viewImg()` method directly uses the provided path to perform a redirect, without validating that the given path is to an actual image on the server or a valid image resource.
2.  **Image Path Injection:** The image path is passed through `com.rebuild.web.feeds.FeedsPostController#publish` method. The attacker can modify the request to the `/feeds/post/publish` endpoint and inject a malicious URL into the `images` array.
3.  **Redirection:** When a user views or tries to download the image on the frontend, a request is made to `/filex/img/<malicious_url>` which triggers the vulnerable code, leading to redirection to the attacker's controlled URL.
