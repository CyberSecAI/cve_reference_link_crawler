- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the file upload functionality of the AgeVolt Portal. Specifically, the `filename` parameter allows for arbitrary file paths, including directory traversal sequences.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability exists in the file upload feature. The application fails to restrict or sanitize user input for the `filename` parameter, leading to arbitrary file uploads to locations on the target operating system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to upload files to any location on the server with web server privileges. This can lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive system files and directories.
    - Overwriting critical files.
    - Remote code execution (RCE) if the web server runs with high privileges (e.g. root). As exemplified in the text, the attacker could inject an ssh public key, create a new user, and achieve complete system compromise by login via ssh.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality within the System Setup menu. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `filename` parameter during a file upload request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the System Setup menu, and therefore trigger the vulnerable functionality.
