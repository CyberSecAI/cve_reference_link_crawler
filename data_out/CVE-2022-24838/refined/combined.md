# Command Injection in Appointment Emails for Calendar

Moderate

[miaulalala](/miaulalala)
published
GHSA-8xv5-4855-24qf
Apr 11, 2022

## Package

Calendar
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

<3.2.2

## Patched versions

3.2.2

## Description

### Impact

SMTP Command Injection in Appointment Emails via Newlines: as newlines and special characters are not sanitized in the email value in the JSON request, a malicious attacker can inject newlines to break out of the `RCPT TO:<BOOKING USER'S EMAIL>`  SMTP command and begin injecting arbitrary SMTP commands.

### Patches

It is recommended that Calendar is upgraded to 3.2.2.

### Workarounds

No workaround available

### References

* [PR](https://github.com/nextcloud/calendar/pull/4073)
* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1509216)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
