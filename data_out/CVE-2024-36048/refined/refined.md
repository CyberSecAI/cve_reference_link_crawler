The provided content relates to CVE-2024-36048.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a badly seeded pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in the `QAbstractOAuth::generateRandomString` function of the `qtnetworkauth` module. This poor seeding leads to the generation of guessable values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure PRNG:** The primary weakness is the use of a PRNG that is not properly seeded, making its output predictable.
- **Data Race:** The fix also mentions a data race within the `generateRandomString` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Predictable random strings could be exploited to bypass security mechanisms that rely on these values. Specifically, the random string is used in OAuth flows, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
- The data race issue could lead to unexpected application behavior, potentially facilitating other attacks.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
- Monitoring the generated random strings and predicting subsequent outputs.
- Using the predictable output to bypass security mechanisms during OAuth authentication flows.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to observe or interact with the application's OAuth flow. The attacker would not necessarily need direct access to the server, but rather needs to intercept or observe the traffic.
