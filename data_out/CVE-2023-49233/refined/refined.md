Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient access controls within the Visual Planning Admin Center. Specifically, the client-side application performs authorization checks instead of the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Server-Side Authorization Checks:** The application relies on client-side checks to determine if a user is authorized to access the Admin Console.
*   **Client-Side Manipulation:**  An attacker can modify the user ID in the server response (specifically the `<ID>` field) to bypass client-side authorization checks.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Functionality:** Once the client-side checks are bypassed, an attacker can access and use administrative functions that should be restricted to administrators only.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** Attackers can access and modify sensitive configuration settings, including:
    *   Modules and services
    *   WebService administrator API key
    *   LDAP settings
    *   Document storage settings (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive credentials)
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify management data, potentially overwriting passwords, adding new users (including administrators), and manipulating planners.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the configured database.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the ability to modify settings and potentially create new administrator accounts, a non-administrative user can elevate their privileges to an administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The application communicates via HTTP using an XML-based protocol. An attacker with network access to the Visual Planning server can intercept and modify the server responses.
*   **API calls:** If the corresponding API requests are known, the administrative functions can be directly called via the API.
*   **GUI Access:** Attackers need a non-administrative Visual Planning account and access to the Admin Center GUI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Non-Administrative User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account within Visual Planning (not necessarily an administrator account).
*   **Network access:**  Attacker must have access to the network where the Visual Planning server resides.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP messages (XML) between the Visual Planning client and server, specifically the user ID in the server response, and be able to understand the API calls.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability can be chained with CVE-2023-49232, which may provide credentials that can then be used to exploit CVE-2023-49233.
*   The vendor's suggested fix is upgrading to Visual Planning 8 (Build 240207).
*   The advisory mentions a custom proxy was used to intercept and manipulate messages.
