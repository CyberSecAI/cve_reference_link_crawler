Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-17514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported to stem from the `boxes.c` file in nip2, where the program was not validating strings before launching the program specified by the `BROWSER` environment variable. This could lead to argument injection attacks through a crafted URL.
- However, it was later clarified that nip2 doesn't actually use the `BROWSER` environment variable. Instead, it fetches the browser executable path from the preferences workspace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The initial report focused on a potential argument injection vulnerability where a crafted URL could inject shell arguments due to a lack of input validation when using the `BROWSER` environment variable.
- The actual vulnerability is related to the potential to modify the preferences file (`~/.nip2-x.y.x/start/Preferences.ws`). If an attacker could modify this file, they could change the browser executable path and make nip2 execute arbitrary code the next time the user pressed F1 (which opens help in the browser specified in preferences).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This could be achieved by modifying the preferences file and injecting malicious code through the browser executable path.
- The code would be executed with the privileges of the user running `nip2`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The initial attack vector was considered to be via a crafted URL that could inject malicious arguments to the browser process.
- The actual vector involves an attacker gaining access to modify the preferences file of nip2, located in the user's home directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have write access to the user's `~/.nip2-x.y.x/start/Preferences.ws` file in order to modify the browser executable path.
- The attacker does not need to be local, but needs to be able to modify this file somehow.
- Exploitation requires the user to use the F1 key in nip2 to trigger the help browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVE was marked as "DISPUTED" because the originally reported attack vector (via `BROWSER` environment variable) was incorrect.
- The maintainers of nip2 state that modifying the preferences file requires already having significant control over the user's system, similar to modifying `.profile`.
