**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of user-supplied input in the `kadence_import_get_new_connection_data` AJAX action. Specifically, the plugin makes web requests to arbitrary locations based on user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin makes uncontrolled web requests to arbitrary locations based on user-supplied data, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker (with contributor-level access or higher) can make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application. This can potentially be used to query and modify information from internal services, perform port scanning, or access internal resources that are not exposed to the internet. This may lead to information disclosure, or even further exploitation through internal services or systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `kadence_import_get_new_connection_data` AJAX action.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WordPress site with contributor-level or higher privileges.

- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.2.12.
- The Wordfence content provides a good summary, impact and CVSS score.
- The Trac content provides additional information through a list of files modified in the commit that fixed the SSRF vulnerability.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) that can be exploited by authenticated users with contributor access. An attacker can cause the server to make requests to arbitrary locations, potentially leading to the disclosure of internal resources.
