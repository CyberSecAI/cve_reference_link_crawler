| Hi, I've upgraded v0.14.0 to v0.14.2 to fix some annoying bugs with deletion, however it brought terraform plan json output to stdout which is quite spammy and contains sensitive variables.  ``` Plan: 30 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. {"format_version":"1.1","terraform_version":"1.4.6","variables":"blabla", ...huge plan json output here.... } {"level":"info","ts":"2023-06-01T12:43:31.393Z","logger":"runner.terraform","msg":"save the plan","instance-id":"fe9710e2-10c5-4c56-9ce8-d3e14e18ac24"}   ```  It being called here: <https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/blob/d8b8c2d99ccd708fa7b154dacde0e06ade5e0faf/runner/server_plan.go#L71>  and seems caused by following code: <https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/blob/d8b8c2d99ccd708fa7b154dacde0e06ade5e0faf/runner/server.go#L196>  Yes, I know that I can disable output with DISABLE\_TF\_LOGS=1 but it also disables all logs of terraform binary which is undesirable.  Possible solution is to disable output before `ShowPlanFile` call and re-enable after. |
