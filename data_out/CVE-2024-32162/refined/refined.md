The provided content describes a vulnerability in CmsEasy 7.7.7.9 related to arbitrary file deletion.

**Root Cause:**
The `deletedir_action` function in `lib/admin/database_admin.php` uses the `unlink` function to delete files based on a user-controlled `db_dir` parameter. While there is filtering on this parameter, it can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Arbitrary File Deletion: The primary vulnerability is the ability to delete arbitrary files on the server.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The filter on the `db_dir` parameter is not strict enough, allowing for bypass using path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can delete any file on the server that the webserver has write access to. This could lead to:
  - Website Defacement
  - Data Loss
  - Denial of Service
  - Potential for further compromise of the system, depending on the files deleted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface via a crafted HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged into the administrative backend of CmsEasy to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the target's file system.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `db_dir`.
- The attacker can use `../` to perform path traversal to access files outside the intended directory.

**Example Payload:**
```
http://localhost:7080/index.php?case=database&act=deletedir&admin_dir=admin&site=default&db_dir=backup_/.....///.....///.....///1.txt
```

This payload demonstrates the use of path traversal (`../`) to delete a file called `1.txt` located in the root directory of the web server.
