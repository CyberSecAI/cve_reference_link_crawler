- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin's file upload functionality for custom fields did not validate file extensions if the site administrator had not configured allowed file extensions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The lack of proper validation on file extensions when custom fields were not configured allowed the upload of any file type.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could upload arbitrary files, such as PHP webshells, leading to remote code execution and complete site takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability could be exploited through the plugin's file upload functionality during user registration or profile updates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker could exploit the vulnerability without prior authentication if user registration is enabled, or with a low-privileged account if they can edit their profile. The attacker needs to be able to submit a file upload request to the vulnerable endpoint.
