Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-26562:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ECKrbAuth.cpp` and `ECPamAuth.cpp` files of the Kopano-Core software. Specifically, the `ECPAMAuthenticateUser` function is missing a check for account validity using `pam_acct_mgmt` in addition to `pam_authenticate`. Similarly, the Kerberos authentication function does not check for expired credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Account Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check for expired user accounts or passwords during authentication via PAM. The system only checked if authentication was possible, not if the account was still valid. The same issue is present in Kerberos authentication.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the missing validation, an attacker could potentially authenticate with an expired account or password, gaining unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could grant an attacker access to the system, bypassing the intended account management restrictions.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once inside, an attacker could escalate privileges, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker would likely require network access to the Kopano server to attempt authentication.
*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs valid (but potentially expired) user credentials (username and password) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user name and an expired password for a user on the target system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the authentication services of the Kopano server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves adding a check with `pam_acct_mgmt` in addition to the existing `pam_authenticate` call within the PAM authentication process.
*   A patch was created and backported from Debian to fix the vulnerability. This patch adds the missing `pam_acct_mgmt` call to the PAM authentication logic.
*   The vulnerability was introduced between specific revisions of the Zarafa software.
*  The issue affects both PAM and Kerberos authentications.
