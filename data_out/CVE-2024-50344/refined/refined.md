Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-50344:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a broken logic in handling supplemental file dispositions. The application intended to only allow inline viewing of files with whitelisted MIME types. However, this logic was flawed, allowing files containing JavaScript to be executed within the application's context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are embedded within uploaded supplemental files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can upload a malicious file containing JavaScript code.
- When a user loads the uploaded file, the malicious script executes in the user's browser, within the application's context.
- The impact is described as "Low" for confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.
- An attacker uploads a malicious file to the server.
- A user then accesses/views the uploaded malicious file via the web application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges, likely being a user able to upload supplemental files.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, specifically someone viewing the malicious uploaded file in their browser.
