Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-4046:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the WebAssembly (WASM) JIT compiler where a stale value could be used for a global variable during analysis. This occurs due to the alias analysis ignoring call instructions within `try` blocks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Compilation:** The stale value usage leads to incorrect compilation of the WASM code.
- **Potential Exploitable Crash:** The incorrect compilation can result in a crash in the content process, which is potentially exploitable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Incorrect WASM execution:** WASM code might not execute as expected, leading to application malfunction.
- **Content Process Crash:** A crash within the content process might occur.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly stated, there's a high potential for arbitrary code execution, as indicated by the high severity, the mention of "exploitable crash," and the "memory corruption" present in similar vulnerabilities fixed in the same advisory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing malicious or crafted WASM code that leverages the `try` blocks and global variable access.
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious WASM file to the browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious WASM file, likely through a website.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was found in the IonMonkey compiler.
- The alias analysis optimization pass was not correctly considering `MWasmCallCatchable` instructions as memory modifying. This led to caching of the global variable value across function calls that could modify it.
- A fix was implemented by ensuring that the alias analyzer processes the last instruction of each block and by providing an empty alias set for instructions like  `MWasmReturnVoid`, `MWasmReturn` and `MTableSwitch`.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 115.1, Firefox ESR 102.14, Thunderbird 115.1, and Thunderbird 102.14.
