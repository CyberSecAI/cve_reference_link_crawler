NewType WebEIP v3.0 does not properly validate user input, allowing a remote attacker with regular privileges to insert JavaScript into specific parameters, resulting in a Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. The affected product is no longer maintained. It is recommended to upgrade to the new product.
