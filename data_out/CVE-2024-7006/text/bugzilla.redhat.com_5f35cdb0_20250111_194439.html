| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2302996#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-08-05 23:02:50 UTC  ``` A null pointer dereference issue was found in Libtiff's tif_dirinfo.c file. This issue may allow an attacker to trigger memory allocation failures through certain means, such as restricting the heap space size or just injecting faults, which would cause segmentation fault. This may cause an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.
