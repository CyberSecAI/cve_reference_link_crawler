| Bug reportBug description:Description A potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, identified as [CVE-2024-7592](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7pwv-g7hj-39pr "CVE-2024-7592"), has been discovered in the `_unquote()` method of the `http.cookies` module in Python's standard library. This vulnerability is particularly concerning as it affects frameworks that utilize this method, including Django. Vulnerable Code The `_unquote()` function uses regular expressions `_OctalPatt` and `_QuotePatt` within a while loop to process input strings. The problematic patterns and their application can lead to exponential time complexity under certain conditions, akin to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.  ``` # http/cookies.py _OctalPatt = re.compile(r"\\[0-3][0-7][0-7]") _QuotePatt = re.compile(r"[\\].") def _unquote(str):     # ... (code omitted for brevity)     while 0 <= i < n:         o_match = _OctalPatt.search(str, i)         q_match = _QuotePatt.search(str, i)         # ... (further processing) ``` Impact This vulnerability has also been verified in the Django framework, where the `parse_cookie()` function uses this method to process incoming cookie headers. This could potentially be exploited by sending specially crafted cookie values to trigger significant delays:   * Cookie sizes of 8000+ bytes caused delays of approximately 0.15 seconds per HTTP request. * Cookie sizes of 20000+ bytes resulted in delays of about 1 second per request.   While many environments limit HTTP request sizes, the specific limits vary, and in some cases, this vulnerability could be exploited.

| [@sethmlarson](https://github.com/sethmlarson) looks like the backports are all unmerged (usually we keep the issue open till that's done) Do you know if there's anything we're waiting on to merge them? If not, I can at least merge to 3.13 and 3.12! :-) |
