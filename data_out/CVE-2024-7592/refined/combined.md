There is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython, specifically the
'http.cookies' standard library module.

When parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters in
the cookie value, the parser would use an algorithm with quadratic
complexity, resulting in excess CPU resources being used while parsing the
value.

Please see the linked CVE ID for the latest information on affected
versions:

| Bug reportBug description:Description A potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, identified as [CVE-2024-7592](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7pwv-g7hj-39pr "CVE-2024-7592"), has been discovered in the `_unquote()` method of the `http.cookies` module in Python's standard library. This vulnerability is particularly concerning as it affects frameworks that utilize this method, including Django. Vulnerable Code The `_unquote()` function uses regular expressions `_OctalPatt` and `_QuotePatt` within a while loop to process input strings. The problematic patterns and their application can lead to exponential time complexity under certain conditions, akin to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.  ``` # http/cookies.py _OctalPatt = re.compile(r"\\[0-3][0-7][0-7]") _QuotePatt = re.compile(r"[\\].") def _unquote(str):     # ... (code omitted for brevity)     while 0 <= i < n:         o_match = _OctalPatt.search(str, i)         q_match = _QuotePatt.search(str, i)         # ... (further processing) ``` Impact This vulnerability has also been verified in the Django framework, where the `parse_cookie()` function uses this method to process incoming cookie headers. This could potentially be exploited by sending specially crafted cookie values to trigger significant delays:   * Cookie sizes of 8000+ bytes caused delays of approximately 0.15 seconds per HTTP request. * Cookie sizes of 20000+ bytes resulted in delays of about 1 second per request.   While many environments limit HTTP request sizes, the specific limits vary, and in some cases, this vulnerability could be exploited.
