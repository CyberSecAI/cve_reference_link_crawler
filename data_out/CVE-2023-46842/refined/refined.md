- **Root cause of vulnerability**: HVM guests can switch freely between 64-bit and other modes, which means they can set registers used to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the 32-bit range. When processing hypercalls takes time, the hypervisor may invoke a hypercall continuation, which involves putting (possibly updated) hypercall arguments in registers. For non-64-bit guests, this involves translation of values, and internal sanity checks assume the high halves of registers are always clear. If not, a consistency check triggers a hypervisor crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the hypervisor's handling of hypercall arguments for HVM/PVH guests not running in 64-bit mode. Specifically, the assumption that the high halves of registers are clear when invoking a hypercall continuation leads to a faulty sanity check and crash if this assumption is violated.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A HVM or PVH guest can cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) of the entire host.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to control an HVM or PVH guest. By manipulating the register values used for hypercall arguments, specifically setting the high halves of registers when not in 64-bit mode, they can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to run code within an HVM or PVH guest. They must be able to set hypercall arguments and manipulate the system such that the high halves of registers are not clear when a hypercall continuation occurs.
