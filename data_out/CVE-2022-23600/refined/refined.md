Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23600:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper audience validation in the SAML authentication process within Fleet. Specifically, the application did not verify that the SAML response was intended for it, which could allow a malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) or a user to reuse a SAML response for unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Audience Verification:** The core issue is the absence of a check to ensure the SAML response's `Audience` claim matches the expected entity ID of the Fleet service, or the lack of any audience verification. This allows for replay attacks and cross-SP authentication issues.
*   **Improper SAML Response Handling**: The application did not sufficiently validate that a SAML response was intended for it, allowing for replay and other attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SAML Response Replay:** A malicious SP could reuse a valid SAML response obtained from a user to log into Fleet as that same user, provided the user's email is the same across the malicious SP and Fleet.
*   **Cross-SP Authentication:** A user with an account on Fleet could potentially reuse a SAML response intended for another service provider to log into Fleet. This is a risk if the user is blocked on the IdP but still has an account within the Fleet application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious or Compromised Service Provider:** A malicious SP that shares an IdP with Fleet could capture and reuse SAML responses.
*   **User Reusing SAML Response:** A user with an account in Fleet could attempt to use a SAML response intended for another SP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious SP Scenario:** An attacker needs to control or compromise a service provider that is configured to use the same Identity Provider (IdP) as the Fleet instance. They also need a valid SAML response issued by the IdP for a Fleet user.
*   **User Reusing SAML Scenario:** The attacker needs a valid SAML response intended for another service, and the targeted Fleet user must be blocked from the IdP but still have a user account in the Fleet instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in Fleet version 4.9.1.
*   The vulnerability is described as "Limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification"
*   The advisory recommends reducing the length of sessions on IdP, limiting the number of SAML SPs used by Fleet users, and deleting users from Fleet when access is removed from the IdP.
*   The fix involved adding audience validation to SAML responses in the `server/sso/validate.go` file, using `WithExpectedAudience` option. It also adds test coverage to ensure the audience validation is working as intended.
