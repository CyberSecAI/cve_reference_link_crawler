- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper restriction on excessive authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient limitations on the number of authentication attempts, specifically through the login form, which can be targeted by sending numerous HTTP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a partial exhaustion of CPU and memory resources on the targeted system. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and involves sending a high volume of HTTP requests to the login form of the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the login form. No authentication is required.
