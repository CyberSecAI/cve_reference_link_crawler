Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `formWriteFacMac` function of the Tenda FH1202 router's firmware. Specifically, the `mac` parameter within this function is directly passed to a `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The `mac` parameter, intended to receive a MAC address, allows the injection of arbitrary shell commands due to lack of input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting shell commands into the `mac` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system. This could lead to:
    - Complete control of the device.
    - Data theft or manipulation.
    - Network disruption.
    - Installation of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint.
- The `mac` parameter within the POST data is used to inject the malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint of the Tenda FH1202 router. This typically means the attacker needs to be on the same network as the router, or have access through a compromised network or other means.
- No authentication is mentioned in the provided write-up, which may imply the vulnerability is exploitable without requiring prior authentication.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was found in firmware version FH1202 V1.2.0.14(408).
- A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit is provided using Python and the `requests` library which demonstrates how to inject a command.
- The `v2` parameter is also mentioned as related to the command injection, although the primary focus is on the mac parameter.
