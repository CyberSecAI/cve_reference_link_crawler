### @fweimer-rh **[fweimer-rh](/fweimer-rh)** commented [Jan 29, 2024](#issue-2104842133)

These result in out-of-bounds stack writes on 64-bit architectures (caller has 4 bytes, callee writes 8 bytes), and seem to have gone unnoticed on little-endian architectures (although big-endian architectures must be broken).

This change is required to avoid a build failure with GCC 14.

I'll ask Red Hat Product Security if they think this needs to be tracked as a security vulnerability.

| Red Hat Product Security has assigned CVE-2024-1013 to this issue.  Isn't `Drivers/Postgre7.1/info.c` just an example driver that shouldnt be used/built in production anyways?  The drivers in here are historical ones or example drivers. They are not supported anymore. But can be used as a starting point to write your own.
