### **[zyingp](/zyingp)** commented [Dec 3, 2018](#issue-386693086)

| Some malformed input could cause the libsass/sassc program out of memory and crashes. These malformed files are not big and are simply adding an extra '/' or '&' in original files (created by fuzzing). The problem can be reproduced both in version 3.5.5 and the master branch (accessed on 2018/12/2) code.  Sample malformed input files include <https://github.com/zyingp/temp/blob/master/sass_mem_37>, and <https://github.com/zyingp/temp/blob/master/sass_mem_38> .  Run `./sassc sass_mem_37` sass\_mem\_37 For example, sass\_mem\_37 looks like below, where the '**&**' symbol before 1 is extra:  ``` $i: 1;  .foo {   @while $i != 5 {     a: $i;     $i: $i +&1;   } } ```  (Similar, the sass\_mem\_38 file, the '/' is added later <https://github.com/zyingp/temp/blob/master/sass_mem_38>) Call stack Since the problem will crash so when I randomly stop the problem, the call stacks looks like below:  ``` #0	0x00000001003b8201 in Sass::Offset::add(char const*, char const*) at /Users/zengyingpei/Downloads/fuzzer/sass/libsass/src/position.cpp:52 #1	0x00000001003b71bf in

`append_token(s->value(), s);` line the `s` becomes a very long string (`1.foo 1.foo 1.foo 1.foo 1.foo...`) and is keeping increasing. **Seems the problem enters some endless loop**. The memory footprint of the program grows quickly (to 1GB and above) and later the problem is killed by the system. |

| The endless loop here is `while $i != 5`.  If you add `@debug($i);` there, it becomes clear what's going on:  ``` oom.scss:7 DEBUG: 1.foo 1.foo 1.foo 1.foo 1.foo 1.foo 1.foo 1.foo ...  ```  Ruby Sass and Dart Sass do the same thing here.  Intended behaviour, I guess.  [@nex3](https://github.com/nex3), Should `number + selector` be a valid operation in Sass? It is now but it seems weird that this is allowed. |

| This is expected; the `+` operation by default converts its arguments to strings and concatenates them. Whether it *should* be so permissive is an open question, but even if not I don't think it's worth breaking backwards-compatibility to fix. |

| The original file has no problem and only a simple extra symbol like '/' or '&' crashes the sassc program. I guess that sometime such extra symbol may introduced in by typos. I am not sure whether there could be some governors in libsass (like an upper bound on loop)? When we are writing code (C/C++/Java), we know the compilers will not crash on our typos or small errors. I am not sure whether sass file is some kind of "code", and sassc could show equivalent robustness. |

| [@zyingp](https://github.com/zyingp) Sass functions more like a programming language interpreter than a compiler, in the sense that it directly runs users' programs rather than compiling them to an intermediate format before running them. A more direct comparison would be to what a C, C++, or Java *program* would do if you ran a loop that continually allocated more and more memory. For C and C++, it would certainly crash in the same way LibSass is doing here. Java is more sophisticated about its memory management and would probably throw a more graceful error once its memory ceiling was reached, but it would still produce an error of some kind. |

| I agree with what [@nex3](https://github.com/nex3) said, sass functions are closer to real programming logic, so it is indeed possible that any input file creates endless loops, thus consuming memory ad infinite. Unfortunately in c++ this means it will segfault at some point due to exhausting the stack (depending on the underlying stack memory limitations). IMO we can't catch this type of errors in a portable way (heap out of memory should already be catched though). Adding a counter and enforcing an upper limit may work for most scenarios, but it does only hide the underlying issue, while crippling the maximum on most envs and also has a performance impact. IMO this should be closed as "will not fix" due to "as designed, user input issue".  On a side note: these kind of issues seem more important for eg. sassmeister or libsass srcmap inspector, since it allows some kind of DOS for remotely available system. But we always had this issue, and I personally use GRSEC/SELINUX to circumvent it. |
