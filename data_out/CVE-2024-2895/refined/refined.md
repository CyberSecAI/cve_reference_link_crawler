Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formWifiWpsOOB` function of the Tenda AC7 V1.0 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `index` parameter from a POST request is passed directly to a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking.
- The `sprintf` output is written to a local stack variable, which is vulnerable to overflow if the attacker-controlled `index` parameter exceeds the buffer's size.
- The overflow overwrites the return address on the stack, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the router.
- This can lead to complete control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `/goform/WifiWpsOOB` endpoint.
- The `index` parameter within the POST data is the vulnerable input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router. This may require the attacker to be on the same network as the router or have some level of network access.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (/goform/WifiWpsOOB) and parameter (`index`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the overflow by sending a POST request with a large string for the `index` parameter.
- The affected firmware version is Tenda AC7 V1.0 V15.03.06.44.
- The `sprintf` function is used to format the input and copy it to the stack variable, making it highly susceptible to buffer overflows.
