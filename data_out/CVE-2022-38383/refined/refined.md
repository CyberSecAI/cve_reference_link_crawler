- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Information exposure through cached data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software stores sensitive information in a cache, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly mentioned, but likely involves accessing the cached data through an insecure mechanism or vulnerability in the software's caching implementation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need some level of access to the system or network to exploit the caching vulnerability.
