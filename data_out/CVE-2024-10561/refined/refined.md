Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the `id` parameter in the `birdsupdate.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. The `id` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL injection vulnerability in the `birdsupdate.php` file.
*   Lack of input sanitization or validation for the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized database access.
*   Sensitive data leakage.
*   Data tampering (modification or deletion).
*   Potential for comprehensive system control.
*   Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to `birdsupdate.php` with malicious SQL code within the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability can be exploited using both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
*  The provided payload examples show how an attacker can test for the vulnerability using SQL injection techniques to inject malicious code from the parameter "id" and use it directly in SQL queries.

**Remediation advice:**
*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input data.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering to ensure data conforms to the expected format.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular code and system security audits.
