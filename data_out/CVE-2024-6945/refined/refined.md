{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation during file uploads in the avatar upload page of flute-cms.com, which allows users to upload PHP files by modifying the header information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Inadequate validation of file headers"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload and execute malicious PHP code on the server by creating an account, logging in, modifying their avatar, and uploading a PHP file with a modified header (e.g. prepending 'GIF89a'). This could lead to complete compromise of the server, allowing for actions like data theft, website defacement, and launching further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Web-based attack",
    "File upload via user interface"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Must have network access to the vulnerable server.",
    "Must have the ability to create a user account.",
    "Must be able to log in to the application",
    "Must be able to modify file headers before uploading"
  ]
