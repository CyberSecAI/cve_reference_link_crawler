**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Brizy plugin for WordPress has an authorization bypass vulnerability due to an incorrect capability check in the `is_administrator()` function. This function incorrectly uses `is_admin()` which only checks if the user is accessing a page from the backend, and does not check for administrator privileges. This allows any logged-in user, regardless of their role, to bypass the intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Incorrect Capability Check:** The `is_administrator()` function incorrectly uses `is_admin()`, leading to authorization bypass for any logged-in user.
*   **Bypassable Security Nonces:** The nonce check in the `verifyNonce()` function is commented out, making it ineffective. Additionally, the nonce used in `authorize()` is exposed in the HTML source code, allowing any logged-in user to use it.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The plugin does not properly check user roles and capabilities before allowing access to its AJAX functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full Editor Access:** Any authenticated user can gain access to the Brizy editor and its functions, which are intended for administrators or authorized users.
*   **Content Manipulation:** Attackers can use AJAX actions to create or modify pages/posts, inject JavaScript code, and change the post featured image.
*   **Data Exposure:** The attacker can view private or password-protected posts/pages.
*   **Form Hijacking:** The attacker can access form information, including user credentials, SMTP settings, and integration keys. They can also modify form configurations to redirect submitted messages to themselves.
*   **Access to other API endpoints:** Attackers can access various other API endpoints for managing fonts, rules, blocks and accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user, including low-privileged users like subscribers.
*   The attacker needs to send requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker does not need to be an administrator.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
