**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Exim smtp service. This lack of validation can lead to a memory corruption condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper neutralization of special elements, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process (Exim) on affected installations.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the smtp service, which listens on TCP port 25 by default. An attacker can exploit this remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  No authentication is required. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service. The attack complexity is considered high (AC:H).
