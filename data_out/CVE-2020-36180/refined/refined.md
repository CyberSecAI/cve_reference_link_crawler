    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "Curation_Level": "Complete",
      "Curation_Status": "Candidate",
       "Curation_Note": "Multiple sources confirm that the issue is related to multiple  DBCP gadget classes as well as related issues including  CVE-2020-36179, CVE-2020-36181 and CVE-2020-36182."
    },
    "Vulnerability_Description": {
      "Technical_Details": "The vulnerability arises due to the mishandling of interactions between serialization gadgets and typing within the FasterXML jackson-databind library. Specifically, the vulnerability is associated with the `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.cpdsadapter.DriverAdapterCPDS` class, which was identified as a potentially exploitable gadget class.  This issue is similar to that described in CVE-2020-36179, CVE-2020-36181 and CVE-2020-36182. The vulnerable versions of jackson-databind are prior to 2.9.10.8, and for 2.6.7.5 but for later versions like Jackson 2.10.0 and later this is not considered a vulnerability as default typing is no longer enabled by default.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Deserialization of untrusted data leading to remote code execution",
		"Insecure use of Polymorphic Typing"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, potentially causing disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or denial of service.",
       "Attack_Vectors": {
        "Attack_Vector_Details": "The attack vector involves sending specially crafted JSON data to a server or application using Jackson for deserialization. The attacker leverages the polymorphic type handling feature of Jackson to instantiate and initialize a gadget class, which then executes malicious code.",
        "Attacker_Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send JSON to a target that uses a vulnerable version of jackson-databind. They also need to know some Java classes that can be used to perform the malicious action.",
        "Attacker_Position": "The attacker could be in a network-adjacent or remote location depending on how the target is setup and what is made publically accessible"
      }
    }
