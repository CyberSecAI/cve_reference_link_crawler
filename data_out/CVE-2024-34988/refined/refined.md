Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-34988:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of SQL parameters within the "Complete for Create a Quote in Frontend + Backend Pro" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, multiple front controller methods are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** Several methods within the `askforaquotemodul` module are vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly used in SQL queries. The affected methods are:
    *   `AskforaquotemodulcustomernewquoteModuleFrontController::run()`
    *   `AskforaquotemoduladdproductnewquoteModuleFrontController::run()`
    *   `AskforaquotemodulCouponcodeModuleFrontController::run()`
    *   `AskforaquotemodulgetshippingcostModuleFrontController::run()`
    *  `AskforaquotemodulgetstateModuleFrontController::run()`
*   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The advisory also mentions that the vulnerable version of the module has other security vulnerabilities such as IDOR, however, the specifics of this vulnerability are not given.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including tokens and administrative information.
*   **Admin access:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain administrative access to the PrestaShop installation.
*   **Data manipulation/deletion:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Email hijacking:** Attackers could rewrite SMTP settings and take control of email communications.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front end, potentially exposing tokens and unlocking admin's AJAX scripts.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through HTTP requests.
*   **Front Controller Exploitation**: The vulnerability can be exploited using a PrestaShop front controller. This method may conceal the module's controller path from conventional frontend logs, making detection difficult. Attackers may only leave traces of `POST /` requests in conventional frontend logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No special privileges required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users (guests).
*   **Low Attack complexity**: The attack is relatively easy to perform.
*   **No user interaction required:** No interaction from a user is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory notes that upgrading to the latest version of PrestaShop will not fully protect the shop against SQL injection attacks that use the UNION clause.
*   The advisory recommends several mitigation strategies including upgrading the module, changing the default database prefix, and using a WAF with OWASP rules.
*   The fix was introduced in version 1.0.52 of the module, and versions <= 1.0.51 are vulnerable.
