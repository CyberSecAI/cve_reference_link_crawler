| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco SD-WAN vManage Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-sdwan-privesc-vman-tEJFpBSL  First Published: 2022 April 13 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvt11537](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt11537)     CVE-2022-20739     CWE-269       CVSS Score: [Base 7.3](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2022-20739     CWE-269       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-privesc-vman-tEJFpBSL/csaf/cisco-sa-sdwan-privesc-vman-tEJFpBSL.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the *root* user. The attacker must be authenticated on the affected system as a low-privileged user to exploit this vulnerability.  This vulnerability exists because a file leveraged by a *root* user is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a specific file as a lower-privileged user and then waiting until an admin user executes specific commands. The commands would then be executed on the device by the *root* user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected system from a low-privileged user to the *root* user.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-privesc-vman-tEJFpBSL>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software   + Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Series Routers  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by any of the Critical or High SIR vulnerabilities described in this collection of advisories and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.  Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s). To ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:    + [cisco-sa-sd-wan-file-access-VW36d28P](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sd-wan-file-access-VW36d28P) Cisco SD-WAN Solution Improper Access Control Vulnerability   + [cisco-sa-sdwan-privesc-vman-tEJFpBSL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-privesc-vman-tEJFpBSL) Cisco SD-WAN vManage Privilege Escalation Vulnerability      | Cisco SD-WAN Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability | First Fixed Release for All Vulnerabilities Described in the Collection of Advisories |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 18.3 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 18.4 | 18.4.6 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 19.2 | 19.2.3 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.1 | 20.1.2 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.3 | 20.3.1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.4 | 20.4.1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.5 | 20.5.1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.6 | 20.6.1 | 20.6.1 |   | 20.7 | 20.7.1 | 20.7.1 |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
