- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A workload identity token in Nomad can list non-sensitive metadata for paths under nomad/ that belong to other jobs in the same namespace.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization logic allows listing metadata of other jobs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor with authenticated access can obtain non-sensitive metadata (job/group/task name, create/modify timestamps) of other jobs in the same namespace. This information could provide context that the attacker might not otherwise have.
- **Attack vectors**: A workload identity token is used to list non-sensitive metadata.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to a workload identity token and be within the same namespace as the targeted jobs.
