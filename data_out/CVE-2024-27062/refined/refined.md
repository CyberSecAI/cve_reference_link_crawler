The provided content relates to CVE-2024-27062.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The client object tree in the Nouveau driver lacked proper locking mechanisms. This resulted in race conditions when adding or removing client objects, particularly during vRAM bar mappings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race conditions due to missing locking around client object tree manipulations (adding/removing objects).
- Lack of synchronization leading to potential data corruption and memory access violations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- General protection fault.
- Kernel crash.
- Unpredictable behavior due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs when there are concurrent accesses to the client object tree, typically when mapping or unmapping vRAM bars through ioctl calls.
- This can be triggered by multiple threads or processes interacting with the Nouveau driver simultaneously.
- The specific scenario appears to be related to vram bar mapping, leading to the race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the Nouveau DRM driver, likely through ioctl calls.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a scenario where multiple threads or processes are modifying the client object tree concurrently.
- A local user with access to the graphics driver can trigger this issue.

The provided content gives additional details by including the crash log, which shows the general protection fault occurring in `nvkm_object_search` function within the nouveau driver. This crash is a direct result of the race condition.
