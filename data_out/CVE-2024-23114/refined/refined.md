- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe deserialization in the Camel-CassandraQL AggregationRepository.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The component is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious payload that is then deserialized by the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must be able to provide a malicious payload that the Camel-CassandraQL AggregationRepository will deserialize.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a crafted malicious payload that will be deserialized by the vulnerable component.
