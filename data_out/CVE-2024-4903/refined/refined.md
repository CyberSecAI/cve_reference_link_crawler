Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4903:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.
- It occurs because the application directly concatenates the user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- Specifically, the `$M_ID_STR` parameter in the `/general/meeting/manage/delete.php` file is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
- The code directly incorporates the unsanitized `$M_ID_STR` parameter into the SQL query.
- The use of string concatenation to build the SQL query opens up the system to injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, personal information, or other confidential details.
- **Integrity:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Availability:** Attackers might disrupt the application's functionality, potentially leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote code execution:** While not explicitly stated, SQL injection vulnerabilities can sometimes be chained with other techniques to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- The vulnerability is located in the `/general/meeting/manage/delete.php` endpoint.
- Attackers manipulate the `M_ID_STR` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tongda OA instance.
- No specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, as the SQL injection occurs before authentication is checked.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint with crafted `M_ID_STR` payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The `$M_ID_STR` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query using string concatenation.
- The code uses parentheses in a way that allows for bypass of certain SQL restrictions, enabling injection.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to inject SQL code to extract database information using boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- The attacker can use the `substr()` function combined with `char()` to perform character-by-character retrieval of information.
- Cartesian product blind injection is used to determine the structure and content of the database.

**Specific Payloads:**
- Example payloads used to extract database name:
  - `1)%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),1,1))=char(116)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B) and (1)=(1`
  - `1)%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),2,1))=char(100)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B) and (1)=(1`
  - `1)%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),3,1))=char(95)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B) and (1)=(1`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor was contacted but did not respond to the disclosure.
- The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 6.3.
- Public exploits are available, increasing the risk of exploitation.
- Google hacking techniques can be used to find vulnerable instances.
- No countermeasures or mitigation strategies are known at the moment.
