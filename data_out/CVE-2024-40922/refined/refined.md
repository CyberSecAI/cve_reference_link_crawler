The provided content relates to CVE-2024-40922.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `io_rsrc_ref_quiesce()` function was attempting to acquire a mutex while the task was not in a running state (`!TASK_RUNNING`). This was due to the state not being correctly restored after `io_run_task_work_sig()` when breaking out of a waiting loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a race condition where the task state is not properly managed, leading to a potential deadlock. Specifically, the code was calling a blocking operation (mutex lock) when the task was not in a running state, triggering a kernel warning and indicating a potential system hang.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a potential deadlock or system hang. The affected code path is triggered during resource quiescence in the `io_uring` subsystem, which could disrupt I/O operations and potentially lead to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `io_uring` system call interface, specifically the `io_uring_register` operation. By registering and unregistering resources, an attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path, leading to the described issues.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to make `io_uring` system calls to trigger the vulnerable code path. This typically requires local access to the system.
