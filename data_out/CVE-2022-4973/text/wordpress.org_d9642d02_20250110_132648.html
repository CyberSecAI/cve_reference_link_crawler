# WordPress 6.0.2 Security and Maintenance Release

---

**WordPress 6.0.2** is now available!

This security and maintenance release features [12 bug fixes on Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=6.0.2), [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/commits/wp/6.0) for the Block Editor, and 3 security fixes. Because this is a **security release**, it is recommended that you update your sites immediately. All versions since WordPress 3.7 have also been updated.

WordPress 6.0.2 is a short-cycle release. You can review a summary of the main updates in this release by reading the [RC1 announcement](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/23/wordpress-6-0-2-rc1-is-now-available/).

The next major release will be [version 6.1](https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/) planned for November 1, 2022.

If you have sites that support automatic background updates, the update process will begin automatically.

You can [download WordPress 6.0.2 from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0.2.zip), or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click “Updates”, and then click “Update Now”.

For more information on this release, please [visit the HelpHub site](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-6-0-2).

## Security updates included in this release

The security team would like to thank the following people for responsibly reporting vulnerabilities, and allowing them to be fixed in this release:

* Fariskhi Vidyan for finding a possible SQL injection within the Link API.
* [Khalilov Moe](https://hackerone.com/entropy1337) for finding an XSS vulnerability on the Plugins screen.
* [John Blackbourn](https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnbillion/) of the WordPress security team, for finding an output escaping issue within `the_meta()`.

## Thank you to these WordPress contributors

The WordPress 6.0.2 release was led by [@sergeybiryukov](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sergeybiryukov/) and [@gziolo](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gziolo/).

WordPress 6.0.2 would not have been possible without the contributions of more than 50 people. Their asynchronous coordination to deliver several enhancements and fixes into a stable release is a testament to the power and capability of the WordPress community.
