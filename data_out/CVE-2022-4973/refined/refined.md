{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2022-4973",
    "Root cause": "The `the_meta()` function in WordPress core did not properly escape output of custom meta fields when displayed on the front end.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper output escaping"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into custom meta fields. When `the_meta()` function is called on the page, the injected script will execute in the browser session of a visitor to the page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with the capability to create or edit posts/pages can add malicious JavaScript in custom meta fields.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have Contributor+ privileges or higher, meaning they have the ability to access the WordPress post/page editor to add custom meta fields. Additionally, a theme or plugin must call the `the_meta()` function, as this function is not called by WordPress core by default."
  },
  "additional_info": {
    "Vulnerability details": "The `the_meta()` function retrieves and displays custom fields associated with posts and pages. In vulnerable versions, the function does not escape the output, allowing execution of injected script. The fix involves escaping the output using `esc_html()` and deprecating `the_meta()` in favor of `get_post_meta()`. The vulnerability was present in versions of WordPress prior to 6.0.2, impacting all versions since 3.7, and was fixed in the 6.0.2 release and backported to older versions.",
    "Affected component": "`the_meta()` function within WordPress core",
