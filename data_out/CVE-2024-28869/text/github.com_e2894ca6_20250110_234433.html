|  |  | This change has been done to avoid Traefik instances with the default configuration to be hanging forever while waiting for bytes to be read on the connection. |

|  |  | We suggest to adapt this value accordingly to your situation, as the new default value is purposely narrowed, |
|  |  | it can make the connection be closed too early. |
