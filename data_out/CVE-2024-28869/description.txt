Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In affected versions sending a GET request to any Traefik endpoint with the "Content-length" request header results in an indefinite hang with the default configuration. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to induce a denial of service. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.11.2 and 3.0.0-rc5. Users are advised to upgrade. For affected versions, this vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring the readTimeout option.
