After the colossal 20.1.0 release just a few weeks back, it's time for a little "smooth the edges" update, but don't be fooled, it's as important as your morning coffee!

## Highlights of OpenMage 20.1.1

* üõ†Ô∏è ZF1Future's version in composer is strictly specified now, it order to fix problems with future upstream upgrades and our composer patches
* üöÄ Totally **new JSON-RPC API is now available**, with support for **instal-login via HTTP basic auth**, it seems to be much more performant than the SOAP one so definitely check it out
* üì¶ **USPS module got a nice upgrade** to support the latest changes in USPS APIs and services
* üç™ A **vulnerability about "guest order view" cookie tampering was fixed**, with the introduction of a **"rate limiting" API** you can use in your own code too
* üêû Few other bugfix and updates
