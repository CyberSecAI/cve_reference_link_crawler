{
  "CVE-2023-41879": {
    "Description": "The web application was found to accept certain requests even without prior strong authentication if the person making the request has data that is non-public but also not secret, such as easily guessed transaction numbers or names.\n\nAttacking entities could possibly exploit this to retrieve sensitive information using this easier-to-obtain data and by trying random numbers.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient entropy in the guest order's 'protect_code', which is used to access order information without authentication. The 'protect_code' is a 6-character hexadecimal string, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure. Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive order information like billing/shipping addresses, payment details, and ordered items for guest orders by brute-forcing the 'protect_code'.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network. An attacker can send HTTP requests to the `/sales/guest/view/` endpoint with a crafted `guest-view` cookie.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "No privileges are required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and iterate through possible 'protect_code' values.",
    "Additional Details": [
      "The 'guest-view' cookie value is base64 encoded and contains a random 6-character hexadecimal value and the order number.",
      "Order numbers are assigned incrementally, narrowing the search space for an attacker.",
       "The attack works only for guest orders.",
      "The cookie is not bound to a session.",
      "The vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing rate limiting at the web server level for the specific route (`sales/guest/view/`).",
      "The fix implemented includes generating a 16-character random string for the 'protect_code' instead of a 6-character string and introduces rate limiting to prevent brute-force attempts"
    ]
