I would say that acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes, given is is widely deployed, is a reasonable (even if less safe) configuration.    Attack complexity is not how to capture the administrators choice of configuration in any case, it is for the difference between 'just works' and 'difficult timing attack' or 'requires network interception'. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=15439#c8)  Ralph Böhme    2023-08-02 06:36:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andrew Bartlett from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=15439#c7)) Oh, thanks a lot Andrew, that is very helpful! :)  So it's a 6.5:  <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N> ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=15439#c9)  Ralph Böhme    2023-08-03 09:39:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 18021](attachment.cgi?id=18021 "Advisory v1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18021&action=edit "Advisory v1") Advisory v1 ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=15439#c10)  Jeremy Allison    2023-08-03 16:41:25 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 18021](attachment.cgi?id=18021 "Advisory v1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18021&action=edit "Advisory v1") Advisory v1  This section:  "When opening the system file handle, Samba internally opens the file in read/write mode as that is required by POSIX when passing O_TRUNC.

Can you explicitly say what the file permissions on the disk are, and why opening for O_RDWR makes it not a problem when "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes" please ? ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=15439#c11)  Ralph Böhme    2023-08-04 16:24:51 UTC  ``` Ok, what about this:  =========== Description ===========  SMB allows opening files for read-only and truncating the opened files by specifying an OVERWRITE create disposition. This operation requires write access to the file, but Samba incorrectly checks the requested read-only permission on the files ACL, instead of the required read/write permission.  When accessing a file in Samba, there are two place where permissions are evaluated and enforced:  1. The kernel enforces permissions for the system open() call  2. Samba's own permission checks based on reading the file's ACL via Samba's VFS and checking the requested access againt this ACL.  It's up to the configured VFS modules where the ACL is read from and written to, in the default case, filesystem POSIX-draft ACLs are converted to NT ACLs, the format used internally in Samba. Samba supports a variety of VFS modules to support filesystem with their own ACL implementations, like GPFS and ZFS, and it has a module "acl_xattr" where the ACL is stored in an filesystem extended attribute as well as in filesystem POSIX-draft ACLs, using a best effort translation of NT ACLs to POSIX-draft ACLs.  This translation sacrifices NT ACL compatibility in certain corner cases, but the module supports an optional mode that can be enabled by setting "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes". In this mode directories and files, when created, will be assigned 0777 and 0666 permissions respectively. This effectively bypasses permissions checks by the kernel, making Samba's own user-space permission checks the only place where permissions are enforced.  Now, when processing a client request to open a file read-only with OVERWRITE disposition, Samba opens the file via the VFS with SMB_VFS_OPENAT() in read/write mode as that is required by POSIX when using O_TRUNC. Therefor most default Samba configurations are not affected by this security vulnerability as the effective filesystem permissions are enforced by the kernel and filesystem driver. If the file only allows read-only access for the user, the open for read/write access will fail with EACCES.  Affected Samba configurations are the ones where somehow kernel file-system permission checks are bypassed, relying on Samba's own permission enforcement, because this check is done against the client request read-only access, and not the implicit read-write one.  The widely used Samba VFS module "acl_xattr" when configured with the module configuration parameter "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes" is the only upstream Samba module that allows this behavior and is the only known attack vector. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=15439#c12)  Jeremy Allison    2023-08-04 21:39:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ralph Böhme from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=15439#c11))  Probably a bit *too* verbose (sorry :-), Goldilocks and the 3 bears and all that :-). How about:  ------------------------------------------------------ The SMB protocol allows opening files where the client requests read-only access, but then implicitly truncating the opened file if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create disposition.  This operation requires write access to the file, and in the default Samba configuration the operating system kernel will deny access to open a read-only file for read/write (which the truncate operation requires).  However, when Samba has been configured to ignore kernel file system permissions, Samba will truncate a file when the underlying operating system kernel would deny the operation.  Affected Samba configurations are the ones where kernel file-system permission checks are bypassed, relying on Samba's own permission enforcement. The error is that this check is done against the client request for read-only access, and not the implicitly requested read-write (for truncate) one.  The widely used Samba VFS module "acl_xattr" when configured with the module configuration parameter "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes" is the only upstream Samba module that allows this behavior and is the only known method of reproducing this security flaw.  If (as is the default) the module configuration parameter "acl_xattr:ignore system acls=no", then the Samba server is not vulnerable to this attack. ------------------------------------------------------ ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=15439#c13)  Sri    2023-08-10 14:57:58 UTC  ``` Hello Ralph/Jeremy,  A couple of questions about this fix:  What is the plan for this security patch being announced publicly?
