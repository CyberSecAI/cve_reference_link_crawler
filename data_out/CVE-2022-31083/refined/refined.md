Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
The Apple Game Center authentication adapter in `parse-server` did not properly validate the certificate used for authentication. Specifically, it did not verify the root certificate issuer, which could be spoofed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Certificate Validation:** The adapter failed to verify the authenticity of the certificate presented during the authentication process.
- **Lack of Root Certificate Verification:** The adapter did not validate the issuer of the certificate, leading to the possibility of using a fake certificate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could bypass the authentication mechanism by providing a fake certificate and its URL, potentially gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could host a fake certificate accessible via a URL that the `parse-server` instance will retrieve. The attacker provides this URL via the `authData` object to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious URL to the authentication system.
- The attacker also needs the ability to generate a fake certificate.
- No specific position is mentioned, but the attacker would need to interact with the serverâ€™s authentication flow.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Apple Game Center auth adapter.
- This property allows the admin to specify the URL of the root certificate for Apple's Game Center authentication certificate.
- If no value is set, the property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022.
- The developer is responsible for keeping this root certificate URL up-to-date.
- The root certificate issuer was changed from Symantec Corporation to DigiCert, Inc.
- The fix also introduces caching of the certificate to avoid repeated network requests.
- The `publicKeyUrl` is also validated to be a valid HTTPS url.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-rh9j-f5f8-rvgc and CVE-2022-31083.
- Affected versions are `<4.10.11 || >=5.0.0 <5.2.2`
- Patched versions are `>=4.10.11 <5.0.0 || >=5.2.2`
