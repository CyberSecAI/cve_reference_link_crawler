Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-controlled input within the `XWikiServerClassSheet` of the XWiki platform. Specifically, the `translation` macro in this sheet was vulnerable to injection because the `parameters` attribute was not properly sanitized before being used. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python, and Velocity script macros via a crafted request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection'):** The core weakness is that the application dynamically evaluates user-provided input within the context of the `translation` macro. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious code that the server would then execute.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application did not properly sanitize the `domain` parameter of the request before using it in the `translation` macro.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary Groovy, Python, or Velocity code on the server. This allows bypassing all rights checks.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker could escalate their privileges from having only view rights on the `XWikiServerClassSheet` and another document to having programming rights.
*   **Data Disclosure:** Attackers could use the vulnerability to disclose all information stored in the XWiki installation.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify all content in the XWiki installation.
*   **Availability Impact:** The vulnerability can potentially be used to impact the availability of the wiki.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific URL containing malicious code.
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The malicious code is injected through the `domain` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only requires view access to the `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` and any other page (e.g. the main page). This is a standard condition even on public read-only XWiki installations, or for any user with an account.
*   **CSRF Token Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the CSRF token (`form_token`) of a user on the system (but it is available on any HTML response).
*   **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker has to craft a specific URL containing the injected code within the `domain` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions 5.3-milestone-2 and later.
*   Patches have been released in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4.
*   A workaround involves manually editing the affected document or importing a patched version.
*   The provided exploit URLs are:
    *   `/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?sheet=XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet&form_token=<form_token>&action=delete&domain=foo%22%2F%7D%7D%7B%7Basync%20async%3D%22true%22%20cached%3D%22false%22%20context%3D%22doc.reference%22%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln(%22hello%20from%20groovy!%22)%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D` (for current versions e.g. 14.3)
    *   `<server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?sheet=WikiManager.XWikiServerClassSheet&form_token=<form_token>&action=delete&domain=foo%22%2F%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Ferror%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fhtml%7D%7D%7B%7Bfootnote%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28%22hello+from+groovy%21%22%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Ffootnote%7D%7D` (for version 5.3 Milestone 2).
*   The fix involves escaping the user-provided input with `services.rendering.escape($escapetool.java($request.domain), 'xwiki/2.1')`.
