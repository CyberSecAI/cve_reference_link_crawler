# matrix-appservice-bridge doesn't verify the sub parameter of an openId token exchange, allowing unauthorized access to provisioning APIs

Moderate

[Half-Shot](/Half-Shot)
published
GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x
Aug 4, 2023

## Package

npm

matrix-appservice-bridge
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=4.0.0,<=9.0.0

## Patched versions

8.1.2, >=9.0.1

## Description

### Impact

A malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API.

### Details

The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious actor could spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests.

### Workarounds

Disable the provisioning API. If the bridge does not use the provisioning API, you are not vulnerable.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
