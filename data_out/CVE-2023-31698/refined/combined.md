| Hi, As per the user safety you should disallow some content as most of the user aren't aware of such security risk. If a user download the product from the repository and doesn't fix this on their side, in that case they will be vulnerable to multiple attack scenario.  Also even TinyMCE has released a patch when they got this flaw so their users can use a safe product. Below is the link for your reference. <https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/tinymce-suffers-big-xss-flaw> |

| Vector Images are really important (especially for responsive design), but many Content Management Systems avoid them because detecting and filtering XSS is a horrible job.  However, losing SVG Support in Bludit shouldn't be the way to go. So how about the following Validation function (can be part of the Valid helper class). It's may not perfect now, but it works on the most common XSS attacks and I also checked the used Regular Expression against [MDN's SVG Attribute's list](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute) to avoid false positives.  ``` <?php  class Valid {     static public function svg($content, $requireXmlTag = false, $requireDoctypeTag = false) {         if($requireXmlTag && stripos($content, "<?xml") !== 0) {             return false;         }         if($requireDoctypeTag && stripos($content, "<!DOCTYPE") === false) {             return false;         }          // Validate XML Format         try {             $xml = @new SimpleXMLElement($content);         } catch(Exception $e) {             $xml = false;         }         if(!$xml) {             return false;         }          // Check Basic XSS         if(!!preg_match("/(<(\/)?script|on[a-z]+=|(java)?script:)/i", $content)) {             return false;         }         return true;     } } ```  ~ Sam. |

| We can also add the following regular expression to avoid URLs except the w3.org standards too, which may leads to false positives if someone adds a URL as comment. This is also not fully tested yet.  ``` (http.)?(:\/\/)?(www\.)(?!w3\.org)  ``` |

| [@SamBrishes](https://github.com/SamBrishes) That regex is a good start but it gets complicated fast: <https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet>  Especially when you can have whitespace in the word 'javascript:'. Let me know if you're serious about using regex for this, I'd be happy to make one that catches the known methods people use to bypass xss checks. |

| Especially when you can have whitespace in the word 'javascript:'. Let me know if you're serious about using regex for this, I'd be happy to make one that catches the known methods people use to bypass xss checks.  Feel free to bypass the regex, but keep in mind, that it still need to be a valid XML file according to `SimpleXMLElement`.  Of course, we can also use an (adapted) version of the Ulf Harnhammar's [Kses Library](https://github.com/pytesNET/php-helpers/blob/master/PIT/Kses/Kses.php) and check each single tag and attribute available in a SVG image only, but I don't think that this is really necessary.  Anyway, Bludit should also just allow admins to upload SVGs to restrict the responsibility and I guess it is also important to check the MIME type of images too, next to the file extension. (For example as I'm using it on my [media](https://github.com/pytesNET/media/blob/master/system/manager.php#L183) plugin). |

| **Description:** I found Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in your Bludit - Flat-File CMS (v3.14.1) on "General" settings to "Logo" field. When I send malicious code use svg file after then the browser give me result.  **CMS Version:** v3.14.1  **Affected URL:** <http://127.0.0.1/bludit/admin/settings>  **Steps to Reproduce:**   1. First login your admin panel. 2. then go to General settings and click logo section.   [screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232166169-066ea571-0fee-4223-8e78-05070583dc4f.png)   3. Now open notepad and save this code with xss.svg name with extension   [script](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232166608-4c408990-10ae-437a-a4e2-7633a1b907f1.png)   4. Now upload this xss.svg file on logo section. So your request data will be:   POST /bludit/admin/ajax/logo-upload HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0 Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------15560729415644048492005010998 Referer: <http://127.0.0.1/bludit/admin/settings> Cookie: BLUDITREMEMBERUSERNAME=admin; BLUDITREMEMBERTOKEN=139167a80807781336bc7484552bc985; BLUDIT-KEY=tmap19d0m813e8rqfft8rsl74i Content-Length: 651  -----------------------------15560729415644048492005010998 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="tokenCSRF"  626c201693546f472cdfc11bed0938aab8c6e480 -----------------------------15560729415644048492005010998 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="inputFile"; filename="xss.svg" Content-Type: image/svg+xml  -----------------------------15560729415644048492005010998--  [screenshot3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232166195-5af03d38-4886-4b59-b039-84513d462df9.png)   5. Now open logo image link that you upload. You will see XSS pop up.   [screenshot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232166213-d19ad9d6-73d8-40ef-9c65-7a502a260f46.png)  **Proof of Concept:** You can see the Proof of Concept. Which I've attached screenshots and video to confirm the vulnerability.    poc.mp4     **Impact:** Attackers can make use of this to conduct attacks like phishing, steal sessions etc.  Let me know if any further info is required.
