Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of SVG files uploaded as logos within the Bludit CMS. The application allows users with admin privileges to upload arbitrary SVG files, which may contain malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious SVG files containing JavaScript can be uploaded, and when these files are accessed or displayed, the embedded scripts execute within the user's browser.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The system does not sufficiently validate the content of uploaded SVG files to detect and prevent the execution of malicious scripts. It primarily checks the file extension but not the content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when the SVG logo is loaded.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites or steal user credentials using fake login prompts.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Website Defacement:** By injecting malicious scripts, attackers could deface the website or manipulate its content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted SVG file through the logo upload functionality within the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have administrator access to the Bludit CMS to access the "General" settings and upload the malicious SVG file.
- **Crafted SVG File:** The attacker must create an SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code designed to execute upon rendering.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported on multiple occasions and different versions.
- The developers have been notified, and mitigation actions were requested, though the issue was closed with the assertion that the administrator is responsible for the content uploaded, implying that the users are trusted.
- The issue was also related to other similar issues in the past, particularly concerning SVG uploads.

**Summary:**
The content reveals a stored XSS vulnerability in Bludit CMS due to insufficient validation of SVG logo uploads. An attacker with admin access can upload a malicious SVG containing JavaScript, leading to various malicious activities like phishing, session theft, and website defacement.
