| Hi, As per the user safety you should disallow some content as most of the user aren't aware of such security risk. If a user download the product from the repository and doesn't fix this on their side, in that case they will be vulnerable to multiple attack scenario.  Also even TinyMCE has released a patch when they got this flaw so their users can use a safe product. Below is the link for your reference. <https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/tinymce-suffers-big-xss-flaw> |
