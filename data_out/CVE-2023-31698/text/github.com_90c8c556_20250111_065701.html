| **Description:** I found Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in your Bludit - Flat-File CMS (v3.14.1) on "General" settings to "Logo" field. When I send malicious code use svg file after then the browser give me result.  **CMS Version:** v3.14.1  **Affected URL:** <http://127.0.0.1/bludit/admin/settings>  **Steps to Reproduce:**   1. First login your admin panel. 2. then go to General settings and click logo section.   [screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232166169-066ea571-0fee-4223-8e78-05070583dc4f.png)   3. Now open notepad and save this code with xss.svg name with extension   [script](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232166608-4c408990-10ae-437a-a4e2-7633a1b907f1.png)   4. Now upload this xss.svg file on logo section. So your request data will be:   POST /bludit/admin/ajax/logo-upload HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0 Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------15560729415644048492005010998 Referer: <http://127.0.0.1/bludit/admin/settings> Cookie: BLUDITREMEMBERUSERNAME=admin; BLUDITREMEMBERTOKEN=139167a80807781336bc7484552bc985; BLUDIT-KEY=tmap19d0m813e8rqfft8rsl74i Content-Length: 651  -----------------------------15560729415644048492005010998 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="tokenCSRF"  626c201693546f472cdfc11bed0938aab8c6e480 -----------------------------15560729415644048492005010998 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="inputFile"; filename="xss.svg" Content-Type: image/svg+xml  -----------------------------15560729415644048492005010998--  [screenshot3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232166195-5af03d38-4886-4b59-b039-84513d462df9.png)   5. Now open logo image link that you upload. You will see XSS pop up.   [screenshot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232166213-d19ad9d6-73d8-40ef-9c65-7a502a260f46.png)  **Proof of Concept:** You can see the Proof of Concept. Which I've attached screenshots and video to confirm the vulnerability.    poc.mp4     **Impact:** Attackers can make use of this to conduct attacks like phishing, steal sessions etc.  Let me know if any further info is required.
