## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# 3D FlipBook < 1.13.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate or escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against high privilege users like administrators.

### Proof of Concept

1. As an administrator, create a 3d FlipBook.
2. Log in as a contributor, and create a post with the following shortcode in it
[3d-flip-book mode='fullscreen' id='1' classes='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
3. Send the post for review (Publish) and preview the post.

### Affects Plugins
