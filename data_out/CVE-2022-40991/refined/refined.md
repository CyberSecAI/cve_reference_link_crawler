{
  "CVE-2022-40991": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality. The `sprintf` function is used to format strings, but the size of the input parameters is not checked against the buffer size, leading to a potential overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary commands.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted network packet with a long string can overflow the buffer during the execution of the 'firmwall domain' command.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and have knowledge of the vulnerable command structure."
