The provided content is related to CVE-2023-30402.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `handle_dot_label` function within the `nasm-token.re` file of the yasm assembler. This occurs during the processing of dot labels.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Heap-buffer-overflow. The `handle_dot_label` function allocates a buffer using `yasm__xstrndup`.  The vulnerability occurs because a read operation attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer. The ASAN report shows a 1 byte read beyond the allocated 3 byte region.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input file to the yasm assembler, specifically one that utilizes dot labels, triggering the vulnerable code path within the NASM parser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to provide a malicious assembly file to be processed by the vulnerable yasm assembler.
