Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the `admin_redirect_url` parameter within the user login function of mooSocial v3.1.8. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This means the malicious script is injected through the URL parameter and reflected back to the user within the application's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal the session cookies of an administrator when they click on a crafted malicious link.
- **Account Impersonation:** With the stolen session cookies, the attacker can impersonate the administrator's account.
- **Malicious Actions:** After impersonating the administrator, the attacker could perform unauthorized administrative actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attack vector involves creating a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload within the `admin_redirect_url` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would likely need to trick the administrator into clicking the crafted URL (e.g. through phishing).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs the ability to create a URL with the payload.
- **Ability to Distribute the URL:** The attacker needs to get the crafted URL to the target administrator.
- **Target Administrator's Interaction:** The administrator needs to interact with the crafted link.
