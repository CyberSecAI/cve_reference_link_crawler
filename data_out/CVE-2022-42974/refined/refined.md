Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure of the Kostal PIKO 1.5–1 MP Plus HMI OEM P 1.0.1 solar panel's web application to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the `filename` parameter within a POST request to the `/file.bootloader.upload.html` endpoint is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **DOM-Based Stored XSS:** The application stores the unsanitized `filename` parameter, and when a page retrieves and processes this content using `innerHTML`, the injected JavaScript executes within the user's browser, which makes it a DOM-based stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application lacks proper input sanitization or encoding of the `filename` parameter, which is the primary weakness enabling this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information from the user's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack user sessions, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Further Attacks:** The injected malicious script could be used as a springboard for further attacks on other users or the application itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is via a POST request to `/file.bootloader.upload.html` endpoint.
*   The malicious payload is injected into the `filename` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the specified endpoint.
*   No special user level is mentioned, it's implied that any user that can send such a request can exploit this.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable firmware version is specifically mentioned: Kostal PIKO 1.5–1 MP Plus HMI OEM P 1.0.1.
*   The exploitation example provides a payload: `<IFRAME SRC=javascript:alert`XSS\_Stored\_DOM\_Based`>`.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-42974.
*   The vendor was contacted but was unresponsive for an extended period before providing a fix.
