| I want to report it to CVE.  Ok, then I'll wait :) Please comment the assigned CVE here once you have it.  If you report this bug, do I need to do it myself?  I didn't do it yet. I thought I'll ask you first whether you prefer to do it yourself. |

| Could you add further info of the impact this bug has? Is there a possibility to leverage this into a RCE condition?  This is a task for security researchers. We are upstream writing and maintaining an image library.  Affected people can update to the latest version. Distributions already started backporting the fix into released versions. |
