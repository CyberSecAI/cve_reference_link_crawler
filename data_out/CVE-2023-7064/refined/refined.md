Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7064

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the `auxin_template_control_importer` function of the "Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the 'id' parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **PHP Object Injection:** The plugin is susceptible to PHP Object Injection due to the deserialization of untrusted data. This means an attacker can inject malicious PHP objects by manipulating the vulnerable parameter.
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is the plugin's failure to validate or sanitize the input provided to the deserialization function, allowing for the injection of arbitrary PHP objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (Conditional):** While the vulnerable plugin itself doesn't contain a POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain, if another installed plugin or theme provides such a chain, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability for Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion, Sensitive Data Retrieval (Conditional):** If a suitable POP chain is present, the attacker could potentially delete arbitrary files or extract sensitive data from the server.
*   **Full System Compromise (Conditional):** Through RCE, attackers could potentially gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests, as the vulnerable function is accessible to subscribers.
*   **PHAR Payload Upload:** The attacker can upload a PHAR payload as an image file which will be later processed by the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Subscriber+ Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a subscriber or a user with higher privileges within the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of POP Chain (Conditional):** To achieve more severe impacts like RCE, the attacker needs to identify or craft a suitable POP chain within the WordPress environment (likely present in another plugin or theme).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.16.2.
*   There is no patch available for the vulnerability. The recommended remediation is to uninstall the affected software.
* The Wordfence article mentions that the action itself is available to subscribers
* The Wordfence article mentions that the vulnerable plugin does not contain a POP chain itself
