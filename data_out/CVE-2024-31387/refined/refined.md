- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Popup Like box plugin (versions <= 3.7.2) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin allows injection of malicious scripts into the website. This is an XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious scripts can be injected into the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious scripts, which, based on the "Required privilege: Administrator" entry, likely means a privileged user such as an administrator is required to be compromised.
