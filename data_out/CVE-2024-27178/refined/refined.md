    {
      "cweId": "CWE-22",
      "name": "Path Traversal",
       "details": "The vulnerability is present in the upload functionality of Toshiba Tec and Oki Electric Industry MFPs (multifunction printers), allowing an attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations, due to improper validation of the file path provided in the Name variable. This can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request with a 'Name' variable containing path traversal sequences like '/./../../../../../' to write files outside of the intended directory." ,
     "impact": "Arbitrary code execution as root. By exploiting this path traversal vulnerability in combination with other weaknesses such as insecure permissions, an attacker can upload malicious files to critical locations on the file system and execute arbitrary commands as root.",
     "attack_vector": "Network. The vulnerability is reachable through the network via HTTP requests to the device's web interface, in particular the /contentwebserver/upload API.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required, as the file upload functionality is accessible without logging in.",
