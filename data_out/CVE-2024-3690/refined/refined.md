Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the "Change Password" page of Small CRM v3.0. This is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied data in the "old password" field.
*   The lack of parameterized queries further exacerbates the issue, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code directly into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing arbitrary SQL code to be executed on the database server.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Lack of Parameterized Queries:** The application doesn't use parameterized queries or prepared statements, making it susceptible to SQL injection.
*   **Lack of Authentication (minor):** While the attacker needs to be authenticated to access the "Change Password" page, the vulnerability still allows for significant unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application by writing a PHP webshell file to the web directory.
*   **Information Leak:** The attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Reputation Damage:** The compromise of the system can lead to significant damage to the organization's reputation.
*   **System Compromise:** Complete control of the affected system might be gained by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessed through the web application's "Change Password" page.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the "old password" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to access the application's "Change Password" functionality.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker uses a SQL injection payload in the old password field such as `'+or+sleep(2)#` to confirm the SQL injection and then uses a payload such as  `'+AND+1337=1337+union+all+select+"<?php+echo+shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>"INTO+OUTFILE+'C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\webshell.php'#` to write a webshell to the server, and then access it via HTTP to execute commands.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by crafting specific SQL payloads in the "old password" field, using `OUTFILE` to create a PHP webshell and then accessing it via the web browser.

**Remediation:**

The provided information also includes remediation steps:
* Implement thorough input validation and use parameterized queries.
* Follow the least privilege principle for database user permissions.
* Deploy a WAF to monitor and block SQL injection attempts.
* Keep software updated with security patches.
* Provide security training for personnel.
* Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
* Configure servers securely.
* Implement continuous monitoring for suspicious activities.
