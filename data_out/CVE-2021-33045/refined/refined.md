Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the handling of the "global.login" sequence within the Dahua devices' firmware. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in older firmware versions where a crafted login request with the following parameters bypasses authentication:

    "ipAddr": "127.0.0.1",
    "loginType": "Loopback",
    "clientType": "Local"

This crafted request makes the device treat the login attempt as if it's coming from the device itself (loopback), thus bypassing the normal authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass flaw, where an attacker can gain access to the device without valid credentials.
- **Lack of Proper Input Validation:** The device fails to properly validate the `loginType` and `ipAddr` parameters, allowing an attacker to inject values that lead to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Full Control:** Successful exploitation provides the attacker with a valid session ID, effectively gaining control over the device and its functionalities.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Access to the device could be used to perform further malicious activities such as altering configurations, accessing video feeds, or potentially pivoting into the network the device is connected to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
- **Network Protocol:** The vulnerability is exploited via the DHIP protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Dahua device.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of the DHIP protocol and the format of the login request, as demonstrated in the provided examples.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in devices with firmware older than the beginning/mid 2020.
- The vulnerable device types include IPC (Internet Protocol Cameras), VTH (Video Intercom indoor station), VTO (Video Intercom outdoor station), NVR (Network Video Recorder), and DVR (Digital Video Recorder).
- The attacker does not need any prior credentials, making the attack anonymous.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the "global.login" sequence, specifically the first or second login attempt.
- Successful exploitation provides a session ID, which can be used to maintain access.
