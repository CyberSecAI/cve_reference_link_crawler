- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unrestricted file upload of dangerous file types.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of uploaded files, allowing users to upload files with dangerous types that could lead to code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through file uploads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated and authorized user to exploit the vulnerability.
