Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `admin/invoice.php` file of the SourceCodester Petrol Pump Management Software version 1.0. This occurs because user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter (accessed through `$_POST['id']`), is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to insert malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to obtain sensitive information from the database.
*   **Potential Data Modification/Deletion:** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection can also potentially lead to unauthorized modification or deletion of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/invoice.php` endpoint.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it easier to target.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `admin/invoice.php` file.
*   The `id` parameter, passed via a POST request, is used to construct the SQL query.
*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the injection using various techniques like boolean-based blind, time-based blind, stacked queries, and UNION queries.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using SQLMap.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub repository contains a README.md with analysis of the vulnerability, including code snippets and proof-of-concept attack details.
*   The `vuldb.com` entry provides a brief summary and a link to the Github repository for more details.

This vulnerability is considered high risk because it allows remote, unauthenticated users to potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and potentially modify database contents.
