# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1712

## Milesight UR32L vtysh\_ubus \_get\_fw\_logs OS command injection vulnerability

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-22299

##### SUMMARY

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the vtysh\_ubus \_get\_fw\_logs functionality of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5. A specially crafted network request can lead to command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

UR32L - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/cellular/router/ur32l/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The Milesight UR32L is an industrial cellular router. The router features include support for multiple VPNs, a router console shell, firewall and many others.

The Milesight router offers several functionalities through the `/cgi` endpoint. The “core” functionality we are considering is called `yruo_debug_firewall`. In this “core” there is a function called “get”. The function that manages this functionality is the `vtysh_ubus`’s `fw_logs_get` function:

```
void fw_logs_get(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2,undefined4 param_3,undefined4 param_4,
                undefined4 *data)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  [... variable initialization ...]
  json_msg_output("!! yruo_fw_logs.get params",data);
  blob_buf_init(b,0);
  data_len = __bswapsi2(*data);
  blobmsg_parse(fw_logs_get_policy,2,tb,data + 1,(data_len & 0xffffff) - 4);                            [1]
  if (tb[0] != (blob_attr *)0x0) {
    base_value_ptr = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(tb[0]);
    strncpy(tb_base_value,base_value_ptr,0x20);
    system_ptr = (system_base_struct *)get_handler_bybase(&debug_bases,1,tb_base_value);                [2]
    if (system_ptr != (system_base_struct *)0x0) {
      switch_to_enable_node();
      _get_fw_logs = (code *)system_ptr->get_func;
      if ((_get_fw_logs != (code *)0x0) &&
         (_get_fw_logs = (code *)(*_get_fw_logs)(tb,"get"), _get_fw_logs == (code *)0x0))               [3]
      [...]
        [...]
      }
    }
  }
  [...]
}

```

The data are transmitted through `blobmsg` structures. The two variable that are parsed into the `tb` array, at `[1]`, are:
- `base`: this value must be equal to “firewall\_log”, otherwise no functionality will be performed. The value of this data will be parsed in the `tb[0]` variable.
- `command`: this value will be used as argument of the `iptables` shell command. The value of this data will be parsed in the `tb[1]` variable.

At `[2]` the `base` value will be used to get a struct handler that in the code is called `system_ptr`. Because there is only, in this case, one valid value for `base`, we know the struct fetched has as value of the `system_ptr->get_func` the `_get_fw_logs` function pointer. At `[3]` the `_get_fw_logs` function will be called:

```
void _get_fw_logs(blob_attr **tb, char* type)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  [... variable initialization ...]
   = (undefined4 *)zcalloc(1,8);
  if (two_word != (undefined4 *)0x0) {
    command = tb[1];                                                                                    [4]
    [...]
    if ((command != (blob_attr *)0x0) &&
       (command_string = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(command), *command_string != '\0')) {
      dup_command = zstrdup(1,command_string);
      [...]
      command_string = (char *)(dup_command + -1);
      do {
        command_string = command_string + 1;
        command_string_cursor = *command_string;
        if (command_string_cursor == '\0') {
          snprintf(iptables_command,0x100,"iptables -w %s",dup_command);                                [5]
          zlog_debug("exec fw command(%s)\n",iptables_command);
          __stream = popen(iptables_command,"r");                                                       [6]
          [...]
          }
          [...]
        }
      } while (command_string_cursor != '&' && command_string_cursor != ';');
      [...]
    }
  }
  [...]
} This function takes as first argument the `fw_logs_get`'s `tb` variable pointer. Then, at `[4]`, `tb[1]` is used to fetch the `command` argument sent in the `/cgi` API. The `command` variable is used, at `[5]`, to compose the `iptables -w <command>` string. This is then used at `[6]` as the argument for the `popen` function, effectively executing the  `iptables -w <command>` shell command.

```

The payload for the `/cgi` API to execute the “get” function in the “yruo\_debug\_firewall” core would look likes this:

```
{
"id":60,
"execute":10,
"core":"yruo_debug_firewall",
"function":"get",
"values":[
    {
        "base":"firewall_log",
        "command":"-S",
        }
    ]
}

```

This would execute the `iptables -W -S` command listing all the iptables rules.

Because no exhaustive checks are performed on the `command` parameters until it reaches the `popen` function, this leads to an OS command injection vulnerability.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE
