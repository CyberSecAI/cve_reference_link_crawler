- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `_get_fw_logs` function in `vtysh_ubus` does not properly sanitize the user-supplied `command` parameter before using it in a `popen` call, leading to OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The `command` parameter from the `/cgi` endpoint is directly incorporated into a shell command without sufficient sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the Milesight UR32L router, potentially gaining full control over the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted network request to the `/cgi` endpoint, specifically targeting the "yruo_debug_firewall" core and the "get" function with a malicious `command` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the router's `/cgi` endpoint.  The CVSS score indicates that the attacker requires low privileges on the device.
