- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information. This information is also available via the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory. The vulnerability stems from the exposure of sensitive information via log files and the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker with access to the files or the web interface can gain access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The sensitive information can be accessed through files/directories and the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the files/directories or have access to the web interface of the product. The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker would need to have low privileges to access the files, however a high privilege level is required to view it from the web interface.  User interaction is required.
