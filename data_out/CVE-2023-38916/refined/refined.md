The content provided describes a SQL injection vulnerability within the `eVotingSytem-PHP` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The code directly embeds user-provided input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection. The vulnerability exists because user-provided input is directly concatenated into the SQL query. Specifically, the username is inserted directly into the query without any sanitization, allowing for malicious SQL code to be injected.
  ```php
   $query = 'SELECT * FROM voters WHERE username = "'. $username .'"';
   $record = mysqli_query($cxn,$query);
  ```

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data: Attackers could potentially extract user information, voting data, or other sensitive details.
- Data manipulation: Attackers could modify or delete information stored in the database.
- Complete compromise of the database: The attacker could gain full control over the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Input fields/parameters: An attacker would need to manipulate the `username` input field to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to provide input to the application, specifically to the username field.
