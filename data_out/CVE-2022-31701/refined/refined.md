- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a broken authentication issue in VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager. An unauthenticated endpoint allows access to system information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken authentication, unauthenticated access to system information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain system information, which can then be used to target victims.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to an unauthenticated endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access. No authentication is required.
