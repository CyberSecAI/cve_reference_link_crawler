Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3061

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the 'type' parameter in the HUSKY Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin. This allows an attacker to control the file path used in an include/require statement within the plugin's PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The plugin fails to properly sanitize the input for the 'type' parameter, allowing an attacker to specify a file path to be included.
- Improper Input Validation: Lack of adequate checks on user-supplied input, specifically the 'type' parameter, enables the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By including a file containing malicious PHP code, attackers can execute it on the server, potentially leading to a full compromise of the server.
- Sensitive Data Exposure: Attackers could include files containing sensitive information, such as configuration files or database credentials.
- Access Control Bypass: The vulnerability can be used to bypass access controls implemented by the plugin or server by executing code that bypasses these controls.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable plugin, including a malicious file path in the 'type' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Admin: Attackers must have administrator-level access or higher to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.3.5.2.
- The patch for this vulnerability was released in version 1.3.5.3.
- The vulnerability was discovered by haidv35 - VCS.
- The patch includes the use of `esc_sql()` and `$wpdb->prepare()` to sanitize user input and prevent file inclusion.
