# JSONata expression can pollute the "Object" prototype

High

[andrew-coleman](/andrew-coleman)
published
GHSA-fqg8-vfv7-8fj8
Mar 4, 2024

## Package

npm

jsonata
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 1.4.0, < 1.8.7, >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.4

## Patched versions

1.8.7, 2.0.4

## Description

### Impact

In JSONata versions `>= 1.4.0, < 1.8.7` and `>= 2.0.0, < 2.0.4`, a malicious expression can use the [transform operator](https://docs.jsonata.org/other-operators#-------transform) to override properties on the `Object` constructor and prototype. This may lead to denial of service, remote code execution or other unexpected behavior in applications that evaluate user-provided JSONata expressions.

### Patch

This issue has been fixed in JSONata versions `>= 1.8.7` and `>= 2.0.4`. Applications that evaluate user-provided expressions should update ASAP to prevent exploitation. The following patch can be applied if updating is not possible.
