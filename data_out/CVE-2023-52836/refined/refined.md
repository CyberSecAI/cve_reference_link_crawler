The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52836.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lifetime issue in the `test-ww_mutex.c` code. The controlling thread allocates `struct stress` structures, which are passed to workqueue threads. These workqueue threads then free the same `stress` structures upon completion. However, the `work_struct` used by the workqueue is embedded within the `stress` struct. This results in the `work_struct` being freed prematurely, before the work thread has finished and while `flush_workqueue` is waiting for completion, leading to corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect lifecycle management of `struct stress` and the embedded `work_struct`.
- Potential workqueue corruption due to premature freeing of the `work_struct`.
- Race condition between the workqueue thread and `flush_workqueue`, causing the latter to return before all work is complete.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Strange crashes due to mutexes being freed while still in use.
- Potential for other unpredictable behavior due to memory corruption and data races within the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by running the `test-ww_mutex.c` code. This can be done during kernel development or when running specific kernel tests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to run the `test-ww_mutex.c` code, meaning they would likely need to have development or root access on the affected system.
