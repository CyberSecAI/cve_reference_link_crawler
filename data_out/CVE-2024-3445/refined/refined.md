Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`$dari` and `$sampai` variables) into an SQL query string within the `data_karyawan->filter($dari, $sampai)` method of the Laundry Management System. This lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection attacks due to unsanitized user inputs being directly included in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially manipulate or extract sensitive data from the database.
*   They may also modify or delete data.
*   In severe cases, they may gain unauthorized access to the system through the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `/ci_laundry/karyawan/laporan_filter` endpoint.
*   The attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `$dari` and `$sampai` parameters which are used in the `data_karyawan->filter($dari, $sampai)` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint with the manipulated parameters.
*   No specific user privileges appear to be needed.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability is present in "Sourcecodester Laundry Management System v1.0"
* The vulnerability was reported by user LI YU.
