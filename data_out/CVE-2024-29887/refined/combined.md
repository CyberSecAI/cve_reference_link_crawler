# Client accepts any certificate

High

[SandPod](/SandPod)
published
GHSA-h6x7-r5rg-x5fw
Mar 27, 2024

## Package

pub

serverpod\_client
([Pub](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apub))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.6

## Patched versions

1.2.6

## Description

This bug bypassed the validation of TSL certificates on all none web HTTP clients in the `serverpod_client` package. Making them susceptible to a man in the middle attack against encrypted traffic between the client device and the server.

An attacker would need to be able to intercept the traffic and highjack the connection to the server for this vulnerability to be used.

### Impact

All versions of `serverpod_client` pre `1.2.6`

### Patches

Upgrading to version `1.2.6` resolves this issue.

### Severity

High

7.4

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-29887
