Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `admin/deactivatestud.php` file in the Online Courseware application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `selector[]` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`selector[]` parameter) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `id` field in the UPDATE query is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially access, delete, or alter sensitive data in the database, including customer information, personal data, trade secrets, and intellectual property.
- **Loss of Data Integrity:** Data within the application's database can be modified or deleted by an attacker.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:**  A successful SQL injection may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized administrative privileges depending on the database structure and permissions

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/deactivatestud.php` endpoint.
- **Malicious `selector[]` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `selector[]` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.
- **Authentication:** The provided proof of concept states that the attack is performed after logging into the application. Therefore, some form of authentication is required for the attacker to reach the vulnerable endpoint.
