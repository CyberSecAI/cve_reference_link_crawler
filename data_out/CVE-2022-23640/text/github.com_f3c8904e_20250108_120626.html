|  |  |  |
|  |  | Update to the latest version (2.1.0) \*\*as soon as possible\*\* to fix a critical vulnerability. The Xerxes XML parsing library that Excel Streaming Reader uses defaulted to allowing [entity expansion](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML\_External\_Entity\_(XXE)\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet), which could be exploited by an attacker to read arbitrary data from your system. The latest versions of Excel Streaming Reader do not allow this and will throw a `ParsingException` if a workbook contains an XML document with an entity declaration. |

|  |  | If you've used [Apache POI](http://poi.apache.org) in the past to read in Excel files, you probably noticed that it's not very memory efficient. Reading in an entire workbook will cause a severe memory usage spike, which can wreak havoc on a server. |
