SOC2+

BD maintains a SOC2+ program for multiple BD products that collect and process patient health information in accordance with the HIPAA security rule. These annual audits address the Trust Principles for Security and, for our cloud-based products, Availability. These reports are prepared by an independent third party and provide assurance regarding the operational effectiveness of BD internal controls and the security of BD products. Use the form below to request SOC2+ documents.

UL CAP

UL CAP, which stands for Underwriters Laboratories Cybersecurity Assurance Program, is an independently audited certification that demonstrates the cybersecurity of medical device products through a rigorous program of analysis. UL CAP cybersecurity testing is extensive and challenges BD products against known cybersecurity vulnerabilities, malware, malformed input (fuzz testing), structured penetration, static source code analysis, static binary and bytecode analysis, and verification of security controls (access control, user authentication and authorization, remote communication, cryptography and software updates). The following UL CAP certificates are available for download:

BD Product Security White Papers

BD maintains Product Security White Papers for its software-enabled products. The purpose of these documents is to provide details on how BD security and privacy practices have been applied and what our customers should know about maintaining security throughout the entire product life cycle. Each white paper includes a Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2 attestation). Use the form below to request Product Security White Papers.

Request Additional Information

With the exception of UL CAP certificates, the following resources are restricted to existing BD customers and can be requested using the form below. Prospective customers that wish to obtain copies of SOC2+ reports or Product Security White Papers can request these from their sales representative following approval of a Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA). Select the documents you would like to access and use the icons at the bottom of the page to trigger the download or request.

Process Overview

# Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

BD has established a routine practice of seeking, communicating and addressing cybersecurity issues in a timely fashion. Vulnerability disclosure is an essential component to our approach to transparency by enabling customers to manage risk properly through awareness and guidance.

```
Process

Disclose

```

BD welcomes vulnerability reports from security researchers, customers, third-party component vendors and other external groups that wish to report a vulnerability in a BD software-enabled device.

```

```

BD partners with the issue reporter to investigate the vulnerability. If confirmed, our incident response team collaborates with various functional teams including Research and Development (which includes Product Security), as well as Quality and Privacy to respond to the issue.

```

```

BD follows FDA guidance to properly communicate confirmed BD product vulnerabilities in coordination with a Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT). We work with the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to prepare coordinated vulnerability disclosures for our respective websites, and we also voluntarily report vulnerabilities unique to BD products to the FDA.

```

```

Bulletins are published on the [BD Cybersecurity Trust Center](https://www.bd.com/en-us/about-bd/cybersecurity?lastUpdate=all-dates#bulletinsandpatches) and the [CISA website](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories") in a coordinated fashion. For maximum awareness, we also share BD vulnerability disclosures with Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) where BD participates, including the [Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC)](https://h-isac.org/ "https://h-isac.org/"). H-ISAC sends hundreds of targeted alerts to its members each year from their Threat Operations Center. This practice helps healthcare delivery organizations of all sizes stay current with vulnerability disclosures across the industry.

```
