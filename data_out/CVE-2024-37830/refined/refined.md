Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation of the OAuth flow, specifically the handling of the 'state' cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The application fails to properly validate the 'state' parameter, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.
- **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The 'state' cookie, intended for security purposes, can be manipulated by an attacker to redirect the user to an arbitrary domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker can redirect a victim user to a malicious site designed to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Compromised User Accounts:** If the attacker can successfully phish credentials, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts the authentication request during the OAuth flow.
- **State Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the value of the 'state' cookie to a malicious URL.
- **Redirect to Malicious Site:** Once the modified request is processed, the application redirects the user to the attacker's specified site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of OAuth Flow:** The attacker needs to understand how the OAuth flow works in order to manipulate the 'state' cookie effectively.
- **Ability to set arbitrary domains in the cookie:** The attacker needs to be able to set a malicious URL as a value for the state cookie.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable version of Outline is <= v0.76.1.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to intercept the request, change the `state` cookie value, and redirect the user.
- The fix is in the following commit: [https://github.com/outline/outline/commit/c9d5ff7ca558ccdd2bbd8ea4fcc05447cce428e4](https://github.com/outline/outline/commit/c9d5ff7ca558ccdd2bbd8ea4fcc05447cce428e4)
