- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Spectrum Protect Operations Center discloses database information in error messages sent to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure. The application improperly exposes sensitive database details in error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially use the disclosed database information for future attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application generates error messages, which are then sent to the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would likely need to interact with the application in a way that triggers the error messages.
