- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `get_membership_amount.php` file. The `membershipTypeId` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without any validation, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows attackers to leak sensitive database information, which may include usernames, passwords, personal data, and other critical information stored in the database. This can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a web request to `/get_membership_amount.php` by manipulating the `membershipTypeId` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific privilege is required.
