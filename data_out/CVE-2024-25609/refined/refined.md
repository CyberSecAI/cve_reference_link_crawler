Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-28977. The `HtmlUtil.escapeRedirect` function in Liferay Portal and DXP can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary weakness is the insufficient sanitization of the redirect URL using `HtmlUtil.escapeRedirect`. The function fails to properly handle double forward slashes (`//`) in the redirect URL, allowing for the circumvention of the intended security mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external URLs. This can be used for phishing attacks or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URLs using parameters that rely on the `HtmlUtil.escapeRedirect` function, such as:
  -  `redirect` parameter
  - `FORWARD_URL` parameter
  - Other parameters relying on the vulnerable function

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft malicious URLs and make users click those links. No special user privileges are needed.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R)
