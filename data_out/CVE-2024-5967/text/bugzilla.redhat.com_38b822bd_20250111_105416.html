The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2292200#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-06-13 12:37:29 UTC  ``` The LDAP testing endpoint allows to change the Connection URL  independently of and without having to re-enter the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. An attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) can change the LDAP host URL ("Connection URL") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console/compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and can now attack the domain.  This requires: Access to the REST endpoint and the admin user needed with manage-realm permission (full access to LDAP configuration and all identity providers).  Version affected: <= 24.0.5   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2292200#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 15:58:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On  Via RHSA-2024:6499 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6499](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6499)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2292200#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 15:58:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:6493 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6493](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6493)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2292200#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:00:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6494 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6494](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6494)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2292200#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:02:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6501 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6501](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6501)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2292200#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:06:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6500 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6500](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6500)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2292200#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:07:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:6495 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6495](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6495)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2292200#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:12:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2024:6497 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6497](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6497)   ``` |  |
