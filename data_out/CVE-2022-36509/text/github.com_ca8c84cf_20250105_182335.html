# H3C GR3200 MiniGR1B0V100R014 Has an command injection vulnerability

## Overview

* Manufacturer's website information：<https://www.h3c.com/>
* Firmware download address ： <https://www.h3c.com/cn/d_202202/1542099_30005_0.htm>

### Product Information

Overview of affected versions of H3C GR3200 router：

[![image-20220724132311844](/Darry-lang1/vuln/raw/main/H3C/GR3200/1/img/image-20220724132311844.png)](/Darry-lang1/vuln/blob/main/H3C/GR3200/1/img/image-20220724132311844.png)

## Vulnerability details

H3C GR3200 (<=MiniGR1B0V100R014) was found to contain a command insertion vulnerability in DelL2tpLNSList.This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands through the "param" parameter.

[![image-20220724112402312](/Darry-lang1/vuln/raw/main/H3C/GR3200/1/img/image-20220724112402312.png)](/Darry-lang1/vuln/blob/main/H3C/GR3200/1/img/image-20220724112402312.png)

Format the `param` parameter we entered into `V15` through the `snprintf` function, and execute our command through the system function. Because `V10` and `V11` are limited to 8 bytes, we can fill `V10` with 8 bytes so that when `%s` in the `snprintf` function is formatted, `V10` and `V11` will be connected actively.

[![image-20220724132824754](/Darry-lang1/vuln/raw/main/H3C/GR3200/1/img/image-20220724132824754.png)](/Darry-lang1/vuln/blob/main/H3C/GR3200/1/img/image-20220724132824754.png)

Although the `sub_100695A4` function filters some dangerous characters, we can bypass them with `$(command)`.

## Recurring vulnerabilities and POC

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1. Boot the firmware by qemu-system or other ways (real machine)
2. Attack with the following `POC` attacks

```
