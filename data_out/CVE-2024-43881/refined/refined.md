The provided content relates to CVE-2024-43881.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ath12k driver incorrectly uses `DMA_FROM_DEVICE` instead of `DMA_TO_DEVICE` when mapping DMA memory for re-injected, reassembled fragmented packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect DMA direction: The driver maps memory using `DMA_FROM_DEVICE` when it should use `DMA_TO_DEVICE` for reinjected packets.
- Information Leak: Arbitrary memory can be allocated to the skb buffer, and because there is no knowledge of what is in the reinjected buffer, private information could potentially be leaked.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Invalid payload: An invalid payload can be reinjected into the hardware and subsequently delivered to the host.
- Information Disclosure: Private information residing in arbitrary memory could be leaked.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting the vulnerability requires sending fragmented packets that the ath12k driver will reassemble and reinject.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to transmit fragmented packets to a target device using the vulnerable ath12k driver.
