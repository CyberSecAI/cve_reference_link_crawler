### Description

The WP Blocks Hub plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.

I like the large selection of blocks that can be applied to all editors. You don’t need to know programming languages, or layout, just use the ready-made one, and that’s great!
