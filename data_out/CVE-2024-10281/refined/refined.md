Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `sub_42EEE0` function of the Tenda RX9 Pro router firmware. The function processes the `list` parameter from a POST request using `sscanf`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The `sscanf` function is used with format specifiers `"%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%s"` to parse the `list` parameter into fixed-size local variables (`v16`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`). The size of user-controlled `list` parameter is not validated, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the allocated space for these variables on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the router. Since the overflow occurs on the stack, the attacker could overwrite return addresses and other critical data, potentially gaining control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted POST request to the `SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint. The attacker controls the `list` parameter within the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected router's web interface.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- **Affected Firmware:** Tenda RX9 Pro Firmware V22.03.02.10 and V22.03.02.20
- **Vulnerable Function:** `sub_42EEE0`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `list` (POST parameter)
- **Vulnerability Trigger:** Inputting a `list` value that exceeds the allocated buffer sizes during `sscanf` parsing.
- **PoC:** A python script is provided that demonstrates how to send a malicious payload to trigger the overflow using a POST request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a link to the vulnerable firmware download page at Tenda's website.
- The vulnerability is located in the `httpd` service of the firmware.
- The exploit is made possible by user controlled input not being validated before being used in the vulnerable `sscanf` function.
- This vulnerability is present in the `SetStaticRouteCfg` functionality.
- VulDB assigned the ID 281556 to this specific vulnerability.
