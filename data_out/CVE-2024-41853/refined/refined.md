- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires user interaction (opening a malicious file). The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the malicious file accessible to the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious file that, when opened by the vulnerable software, triggers the heap-based buffer overflow. No special privileges are needed.
