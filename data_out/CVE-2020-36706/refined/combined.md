[WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITIES](/vulnerabilities/)

[Standard & Premium](/vulnerabilities/web/)
# WordPress Plugin Simple:Press-WordPress Forum Arbitrary File Upload (6.6.0)

## Description

WordPress Plugin Simple:Press-WordPress Forum is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers upload arbitrary files because the application fails to properly verify user-supplied input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to upload arbitrary code and run it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation; other attacks are also possible. WordPress Plugin Simple:Press-WordPress Forum version 6.6.0 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.

## Remediation

Update to plugin version 6.6.1 or latest

# WordPress Simple:Press plugin fixed critical vulnerabilities.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [September 25, 2020 - 12:36pm [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:19pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-simplepress-plugin-fixed-critical-vulnerabilities/)

The WordPress [Simple:Press](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simplepress/) plugin (600+ active installations) fixed a broken access control vulnerability affecting version 6.6.0 and below that could lead to unauthenticated arbitrary file upload and remote code execution.

### Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload

The plugin registers several AJAX actions in the “sp-startup/admin/spa-admin-ajax-actions.php” script. However, those hooks will only be loaded if the `HTTP_REFERER` of the HTTP request includes the path to the blog’s admin URL, e.g., `http://example.com/wp-admin/`, as we can see in the “sp-startup/core/sp-core-ajax.php” script:

```
function sp_is_frontend_ajax() {
    $ajax = false;
    if (wp_doing_ajax()) {
        $filename = isset($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']) ? $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] : '';
        $ref = isset($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']) ? wp_unslash($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']) : '';
        if (((strpos($ref, admin_url()) === false) && (basename($filename) === 'admin-ajax.php'))) {
            $ajax = true;
        }
    }

    return $ajax;
}

```

The `uploader` action, used by a logged-in administrator to upload custom icons, is accessible to all users, authenticated or not:

```
function spa_ajax_uploader() {
   require SP_PLUGIN_DIR.'/admin/resources/jscript/ajaxupload/sf-uploader.php';
}

add_action('wp_ajax_uploader', 'spa_ajax_uploader');
add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_uploader', 'spa_ajax_uploader');

```

It loads the “admin/resources/jscript/ajaxupload/sf-uploader.php” script that will handle the upload:

```
<?php
/*
Simple:Press
Image Uploader Script
$LastChangedDate: 2010-03-26 16:38:27 -0700 (Fri, 26 Mar 2010) $
$Rev: 3818 $
*/

if (preg_match('#'.basename(__FILE__).'#', $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])) die('Access denied - you cannot directly call this file');

// ========= NEEDS TO BE TURNED OFF UNTIL ALL PLUGIN ADMIN FORMS ARE CHANGED TO USE THE NEW NONCE CODE
//if (!sp_nonce('uploader')) die();
// ===================================================================================================

# workaround function for php installs without exif.  leave original function since this is slower.
if (!function_exists('exif_imagetype')) {
    function exif_imagetype($filename) {
        if ((list($width, $height, $type, $attr) = @getimagesize(str_replace(' ', '%20', $filename))) !== falseprepend) return $type;
    	return false;
    }
}

$uploaddir = SP()->filters->str($_POST['saveloc']);

# Clean up file name just in case
$uploadfile = $uploaddir.SP()->saveFilters->filename(basename($_FILES['uploadfile']['name']));

# check image file mimetype
$mimetype = 0;
$mimetype = exif_imagetype($_FILES['uploadfile']['tmp_name']);
if (empty($mimetype) || $mimetype == 0 || $mimetype > 3) {
	echo 'invalid';
	die();
}

# check for existence
if (file_exists($uploadfile)) {
	echo 'exists';
	die();
}

# check file size against limit if provided
if (isset($_POST['size'])) {
	if ($_FILES['uploadfile']['size'] > $_POST['size']) {
		echo 'size';
		die();
	}
}

# try uploading the file over
if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploadfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile)) {
	@chmod("$uploadfile", 0644);
	echo "success";
} else {
	# WARNING! DO NOT USE "FALSE" STRING AS A RESPONSE!
	# Otherwise onSubmit event will not be fired
	echo "error";
}

die();

```

The function lacks a capability check and a security nonce. It only tries to verify the type of the file with the `exif_imagetype` function. I explained in [a previous post](https://blog.nintechnet.com/arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-wordpress-user-submitted-posts-plugin/) that PHP developers should never rely on functions such as `exif_imagetype` or `getimagesize` for security checks because they can easily be bypassed. In the above example, an unauthenticated attacker could prepend the `GIF` magic bytes to a PHP script, upload it and bypass the verification. Unless the path to the destination folder is assigned to the `$_POST['saveloc']` variable, the file will be uploaded into `/wp-admin/`, the current directory:

### Authenticated arbitrary file upload

Still in the “sp-startup/admin/spa-admin-ajax-actions.php” script, the `spa_ajax_iconset_uploader` function is loaded via the `iconset_uploader` AJAX action and accessible to authenticated users only (Simple:Press being a forum, all members can access it). It is used by the administrator to upload their own custom iconsets in a ZIP archive.

```
/**
* load iconset uploader script
*/
function spa_ajax_iconset_uploader() {
   require SP_PLUGIN_DIR.'/admin/resources/jscript/ajaxupload/sf-iconset_uploader.php';
}

add_action('wp_ajax_iconset_uploader', 'spa_ajax_iconset_uploader');

```

The upload and extraction of the ZIP file is handled by the “admin/resources/jscript/ajaxupload/sf-iconset\_uploader.php” script:

```
<?php
/*
Simple:Press
Iconset Uploader Script
*/

if (preg_match('#'.basename(__FILE__).'#', $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])) die('Access denied - you cannot directly call this file');

// ========= NEEDS TO BE TURNED OFF UNTIL ALL PLUGIN ADMIN FORMS ARE CHANGED TO USE THE NEW NONCE CODE
//if (!sp_nonce('uploader')) die();
// ===================================================================================================

require_once SP_PLUGIN_DIR.'/admin/library/spa-iconsets.php';

$sfconfig          = SP()->options->get('sfconfig');

$iconsets_base_dir = SP_STORE_DIR . '/' . $sfconfig['iconsets'] . '/';

$upload_dir = $iconsets_base_dir . '__uploads/';

if ( !file_exists($upload_dir) ) {
   @mkdir($upload_dir, 0775);
}

# Clean up file name just in case
$filename = strtolower ( SP()->saveFilters->filename( basename( $_FILES['uploadfile']['name'] ) ) );
$uploadfile = $upload_dir. $filename;

$filename_info = pathinfo( $filename );
$iconset_id = $filename_info['filename'];
$extract_to = $iconsets_base_dir . $filename_info['filename'];

# check for existence
if ( file_exists( $uploadfile ) || file_exists( $extract_to ) ) {
   echo 'exists';
   die();
}

# try uploading the file over
if ( move_uploaded_file( $_FILES['uploadfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile ) ) {
   @chmod( $uploadfile, 0644 );

   # Now try and unzip it
   require_once ABSPATH.'wp-admin/includes/class-pclzip.php';
   $zipfile       = $uploadfile;
   $zipfile       = str_replace('\\', '/', $zipfile); # sanitize for Win32 installs
   $zipfile       = preg_replace('|/+|', '/', $zipfile); # remove any duplicate slash
   $extract_to       = str_replace('\\', '/', $extract_to); # sanitize for Win32 installs
   $extract_to       = preg_replace('|/+|', '/', $extract_to); # remove any duplicate slash
   $archive       = new PclZip($zipfile);

   $archive->extract($extract_to);
   if ($archive->error_code == 0) {

      $response = spa_add_iconset( array(
         'id'   => $iconset_id,
         'active' => true
      ) );

      if( is_wp_error( $response) ) {
         echo 'error';
         die();
      }

      $successExtract1 = true;
   } else {
      echo "error";
      die();
   }

   # Lets try and remove the zip as it seems to have worked
   @unlink($zipfile);

   echo "success";
} else {
   # WARNING! DO NOT USE "FALSE" STRING AS A RESPONSE!
   # Otherwise onSubmit event will not be fired
   echo "error";
}

die();

```

Here too, there’s no capability check or security nonce, allowing any authenticated user to upload one or more PHP scripts packed into a ZIP file and, despite the error returned by the `spa_add_iconset` function when checking the files, the content of the archive will be extracted anyway and accessible at `http://example.com/wp-content/sp-resources/forum-iconsets/{name_of_zip_file}/{name_of_php_script}`.

### Timeline

The vulnerabilities were reported to the authors on September 18th, 2020 and a new version 6.6.1 was quickly released on the same day.

### Description

The Simple:Press – WordPress Forum Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ~/admin/resources/jscript/ajaxupload/sf-uploader.php file in versions up to, and including, 6.6.0.
