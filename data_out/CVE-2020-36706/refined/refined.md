Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-36706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation within the Simple:Press WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `sf-uploader.php` script does not adequately verify the uploaded file's type, relying on easily bypassed functions like `exif_imagetype`.
*  Additionally, there is a broken access control issue as the upload functionality lacks capability checks and security nonces, allowing unauthenticated users to access the `uploader` AJAX action and authenticated users to access the `iconset_uploader` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient validation of file types and lack of capability checks, allowing both authenticated and unauthenticated users to upload files.
*   **Broken Access Control:** The AJAX actions responsible for file uploads are accessible without proper authorization checks allowing unauthorized users to trigger these actions.
*   **Insecure File Type Verification:** The use of `exif_imagetype` for file type checking can be easily bypassed by prepending magic bytes to malicious files.
*   **Missing Security Nonce:** The upload functionality lacks security nonces, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks, although not explicitly stated that it's being exploited as such in the provided information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious PHP scripts, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the affected website.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the webserver and potentially escalate privileges.
*   **Data compromise/manipulation**: The ability to execute code on the server could lead to further compromise and manipulation of data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the plugin's AJAX endpoints. This can be done via the `uploader` action for unauthenticated users, and `iconset_uploader` for authenticated users.
*   **File Upload:** Specifically, malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts with prepended GIF magic bytes) are uploaded through the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the target website to send HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Required (for one of the vulnerabilities):**  One vulnerability (in `uploader` action) can be exploited by unauthenticated users, making it easily exploitable by anyone with network access to the website.
*   **Authenticated User (for one of the vulnerabilities):**  The other vulnerability (in `iconset_uploader` action) requires any authenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Simple:Press plugin versions 6.6.0 and below.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.6.1.
*   The `sf-uploader.php` script was vulnerable to unauthenticated file upload via the `uploader` AJAX action, while `sf-iconset_uploader.php` was vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary file upload via the `iconset_uploader` AJAX action, leading to RCE.
