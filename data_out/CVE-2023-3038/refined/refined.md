- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, it is exploitable through the `rows` parameter of the `/jsonGrid` route.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send a specially crafted SQL query, which can allow them to extract all the information stored in the application's database. This includes sensitive data and potentially user credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, where an attacker sends a specially crafted SQL query through the vulnerable `rows` parameter of the `/jsonGrid` route.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any prior authentication to the application.
