Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setSchedWifi` function of the Tenda AC10U router firmware. This occurs because user-provided input for the `schedEndTime` parameter is passed to a function without any length checks.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow. The `schedEndTime` parameter, received from the user (attacker), is copied into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without validation of its length.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not perform any length validation on the `schedEndTime` parameter before copying it into the stack-based buffer.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending an overly long string, the attacker can overwrite the stack and cause the `httpd` process to crash, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The content states the potential for remote code execution, which is feasible if the attacker can precisely control the overflow to overwrite return addresses and execute arbitrary code.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint.
    *  **`schedEndTime` Parameter:** The malicious payload is sent within the `schedEndTime` parameter of the POST request.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This means they need to be on the same network as the router or have access through port forwarding or other means.
    *   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint and the `schedEndTime` parameter in order to trigger the vulnerability.

The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit code, written in Python that sends a large string as the `schedEndTime` parameter which results in the httpd process crash.
