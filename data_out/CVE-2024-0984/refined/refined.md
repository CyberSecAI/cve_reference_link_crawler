Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0984

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `disableOptimization` function in the ImageRecycle pdf & image compression plugin lacked a capability check. This means that the function could be accessed and executed by users who did not have the necessary permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a proper authorization check before executing the `disableOptimization` function. Specifically, the plugin does not verify if the user has the 'manage_options' capability before allowing the image optimization setting to be disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Modification of Settings:** An attacker with subscriber-level access or above can disable the image optimization setting, potentially leading to a denial-of-service by preventing further image compression.
- **Impact on Functionality:** Disabling the optimization would prevent new images from being processed, and could impact the performance of a WordPress site

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site.
- **Subscriber-Level Access or Above:** An attacker with at least subscriber-level access, or any role with more permissions can exploit this flaw.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.1.14 by adding the `current_user_can('manage_options')` check before executing the `disableOptimization` function.
- The provided changelog also mentions a fix for a XSS vulnerability, which is not part of the CVE description for CVE-2024-0984.
- The fix added nonce verification (`check_ajax_referer`) to the AJAX calls, preventing CSRF as well.
