Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak caused by a change in how request queue quality of service (rq qos) structures are released. Previously, `blk_cleanup_queue()` was responsible for calling `rq_qos_exit()` to release these structures. However, commit 8e141f9eb803 moved `rq_qos_exit()` to `del_gendisk()`. This introduced a leak because some queues might not have an associated disk (e.g., un-present SCSI LUNs, NVMe admin queues), meaning `del_gendisk()` would not be called, and the `rq_qos` structures would not be released.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The core vulnerability is the failure to free allocated memory for rq qos structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unreleased memory would accumulate over time. This could lead to:
    -  System instability
    -  Denial-of-service due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by scenarios where a request queue is cleaned up (`blk_cleanup_queue`) without having a corresponding disk to trigger the `del_gendisk()` code path which would have released the memory. This could occur with:
     - Un-present SCSI LUNs
     - NVMe admin queues
     - potentially other cases where a request queue is created and then cleaned up without a disk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not necessarily require root access but needs to be able to trigger the creation and cleanup of request queues which do not have a disk associated with them. It could be triggered by a local user or indirectly by a remote user through some I/O operations related to the affected devices.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding `rq_qos_exit(q)` back into `blk_cleanup_queue(q)` to ensure these structures are always released during cleanup.
- The vulnerability was fixed in v5.18 by moving `blkcg_init_queue()` and `blkcg_exit_queue()` into the disk allocation/release handler. The patches provided here apply to earlier kernel versions.
- This vulnerability was reported by syzbot, a fuzzer for Linux kernels.
- The provided git diffs shows the fix being applied by adding the call to `rq_qos_exit(q)` within the `blk_cleanup_queue` function in `block/blk-core.c`.
