  "summary": "CVE-2024-8696 is a vulnerability related to Docker Desktop where a crafted extension publisher-url/additional-urls could be abused by a malicious extension to achieve RCE.",
  "details": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause of vulnerability",
      "detail": "A vulnerability exists in how Docker Desktop handles extension metadata, specifically in the publisher-url and additional-urls fields, where a crafted URL can lead to arbitrary code execution."
    },
    {
      "type": "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present",
      "detail": "The vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability stemming from insufficient input validation when parsing extension metadata. Specifically, the lack of proper sanitization or validation of URLs provided by extensions."
    },
    {
      "type": "Impact of exploitation",
      "detail": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution, potentially taking control of the system running Docker Desktop."
    },
    {
      "type": "Attack vectors",
      "detail": "The attack vector involves a malicious Docker extension that contains crafted URLs in its metadata fields such as 'publisher-url' or 'additional-urls'. When Docker Desktop parses this metadata, the crafted URLs are processed in a way that allows the execution of arbitrary code."
    },
     {
      "type": "Required attacker capabilities/position",
      "detail": "The attacker needs to create or modify a Docker extension with malicious URLs. The attacker needs to trick the victim into installing this malicious extension onto their system."
