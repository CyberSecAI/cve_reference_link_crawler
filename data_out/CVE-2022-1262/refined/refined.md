- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `/bin/protest` binary on various D-Link router firmware images is vulnerable to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability in the `/bin/protest` binary.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands as root, potentially obtaining a root shell on the device.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1.  Gain access to the `/bin/cli` interface via telnet.
    2.  Craft and send a malicious input to the `protest` binary through the `cli` interface, triggering the command injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    1.  Must be able to download, decrypt, unpack and repack the router's configuration binary.
    2. Must be able to modify the config to enable telnet on the device.
    3. Must be able to upload the modified config through the web interface.
    4. Must authenticate to the `/bin/cli` interface using the admin password of the web UI appended with "@twsz2018".
    5.  Must be able to send commands to the `/bin/cli` interface.
