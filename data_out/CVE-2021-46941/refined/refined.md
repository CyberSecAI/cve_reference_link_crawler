Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DWC3 USB controller driver was missing crucial steps when switching between host and device modes for a Dual-Role-Data (DRD) controller. Specifically, the driver was not performing a core soft reset (GCTL.CoreSoftReset) at the beginning of the mode switch, and was also missing device reset (DCTL.CSftRst) when switching from host to device. These steps are mandated by the programming guide for proper mode switching on DRD controllers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability lies in the incomplete implementation of the mode switching sequence for the DWC3 USB controller. Not performing the core soft reset and device reset leads to undefined behavior and potential lockups.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The lack of proper reset during mode switching can lead to a system lockup. The provided text specifically mentions lockup issues observed with HiKey960 platform and Ferry's testing platform which could lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is the improper handling of the mode switching in the DWC3 USB controller driver. Any process triggering a mode change in the controller could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger a USB mode switch (from host to device or vice versa) on a system using the affected DWC3 USB controller driver. This could be achieved by a malicious USB device or by a compromised application initiating the switch.

**Additional details:**
The fix includes the following:
1.  Adding `GCTL.CoreSoftReset` at the beginning of mode switching procedure in both host-to-device and device-to-host transitions.
2.  Adding a 100ms delay after `GCTL.CoreSoftReset` to allow clock synchronization.
3.  Adding `DCTL.CSftRst` during host-to-device transitions
4. Adding a mutex to serialize mode switching operations

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that all required reset steps are performed during mode transitions, as recommended by the programming guide for the DWC3 USB controller.
