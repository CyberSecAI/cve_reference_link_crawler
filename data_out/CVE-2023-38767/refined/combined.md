# Welcome to the ChurchCRM

## What Is ChurchCRM?

ChurchCRM is a web based mobile enabled Church Management Software. It is a fork of [ChurchInfo](http://www.churchdb.org/), which is a fork from [InfoCentral](https://sourceforge.net/projects/infocentral/). Refer to the ChurchInfo and InfoCentral project sites for additional credits and history.

ChurchCRM adds the following features to the previous generations of the project:

* Member Directory
* Member Profiles
* Attendance Tracking
* Group Management
* Sunday School Management
* Event Management
* Volunteer Management
* Checkout all of the system [Features](wiki/Features)

## The ChurchCRM team:

* [See contributors](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/graphs/contributors)

## Getting started

The application is based on the concepts of people who are members of families and are also members of common interest groups. After you have installed the ChurchCRM application and can login, you are ready to configure the application. The first thing to do is enter your church name, address, phone and email address into the Report Settings. ChurchCRM will display “My Church” in large, bold letters at the top of each page. During the configuration stage, give some consideration to how you will use ChurchCRM:

* What are the groups that you will use?
* What properties do you need to record for people, families and groups?
* Do you need to use custom fields?
* Who needs access to the administration features?
* Who should be given access to the Financial records?
* Who can add or change records?

## Other Open Source code used in this project:

* [Php Composer Dev/Test Dependencies](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/blob/master/src/composer.json)
* [JavaScript NPM Dev/Test/Build Dependencies](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/network/dependencies)

### Get Installed

Since ChurchCRM is a web-based application, you won't need to worry about what devices are used to access it. All the "heavy lifting" is one on the server using what's commonly known as LAMP. LAMP represents a set of applications combined with an operating system: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

Install via:

* [Softaculous](http://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/apps/erp/ChurchCRM).
* [CPanel on Shared Hosting](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/wiki/Installing-ChurchCRM-in-Cpanel-shared-hosting).
* [See all the other options](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/wiki/Installation).
* [Watch the install video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMjZpo3aO5Q).

### Get Started

The application is based on the concepts of people who are members of families and are also members of common interest groups. After you have installed the ChurchCRM application and can login, you are ready to configure the application. The first thing to do is enter your church name, address, phone and email address into the Report Settings. ChurchCRM will display “My Church” in large, bold letters at the top of each page. During the configuration stage, give some consideration to how you will use ChurchCRM:

* What are the groups that you will use?
* What properties do you need to record for people, families and groups?
* Do you need to use custom fields?
* Who needs access to the administration features?
* Who should be given access to the Financial records?
* Who can add or change records?
* [First Run Configuration Items](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/wiki/First-Run-Configuration-Items)

### Get Involved

We  contributors! A lot of people over the last 10 years have helped make ChurchCRM awesome!

**History:** ChurchCRM is a branch off of two former open-source projects. It started via the team behind a program called [InfoCentral](http://sourceforge.net/projects/infocentral/).
5 years later,  [ChurchInfo](http://www.churchdb.org/) took over the code base.

After examining the inner workings of these ChurchInfo, we have started working on ChurchCRM by adding new features and bringing it up to speed with modern application
development techniques here on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM)!

You don't need to be a developer to contribute to the software; we are always adding new features to the application that need to be localized.
Join our [POEditor.com](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=RABdnDSqAt) project to help translate the software into your native language.

# CVE-Disclosures

Welcome to the CVE disclosures section of this repository! Here, you'll find a list of security vulnerabilities that I have discovered while working on Free Open Source Software (FOSS) applications.

## CVEs I Have Discovered

| Findings | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CVE-2023-38758](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/wger%20Workout%20Manager/CVE-2023-38758) | A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in wger Workout Manager v2.2.0a3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `license_author` parameter of the `/en/nutrition/ingredient/add/` endpoint. |
| [CVE-2023-38759](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/wger%20Workout%20Manager/CVE-2023-38759) | A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in wger Workout Manager v2.2.0a3 allows remote attackers to gain privileges via email change and password reset functionality at `/en/user/preferences`, `/en/gym/user/1/reset-user-password`, and `/en/user/password/reset/`. These attack vectors can allow any account to be compromised, with resulting data exfiltrated back to the attacker's server. |
| [CVE-2023-38760](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ChurchCRM/CVE-2023-38760) | A SQL injection vulnerability in ChurchCRM v.5.0.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive database information via the role and gender parameters within the `/QueryView.php?QueryID=7` endpoint (Person by Role and Gender query). This can be used for information disclosure of anything in the database, including user credentials. |
| [CVE-2023-38761](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ChurchCRM/CVE-2023-38761) | A cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ChurchCRM v5.0.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted payload to the `systemSettings.php` endpoint. This payload is placed within the site header and is triggered whenever anyone authenticated views any page. This vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's session, perform information disclosure, or potentially perform other CSRF attacks. |
| [CVE-2023-38762](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ChurchCRM/CVE-2023-38762) | A SQL injection vulnerability in ChurchCRM v.5.0.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive database information via the `friendmonths` parameter within the `/QueryView.php?QueryID=26` endpoint (Recent Friends query). This can be used for information disclosure of anything in the database, including user credentials. |
| [CVE-2023-38763](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ChurchCRM/CVE-2023-38763) | A SQL injection vulnerability in ChurchCRM v.5.0.0 allows an authenticated remote attacker to obtain sensitive database information via the FundRaiserID parameter within the `/FundRaiserEditor.php` endpoint. This can be used for information disclosure of anything in the database, including user credentials. |
| [CVE-2023-38764](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ChurchCRM/CVE-2023-38764) | A SQL injection vulnerability in ChurchCRM v.5.0.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive database information via the `birthmonth` and `percls` parameters within the `/QueryView.php?QueryID=18` endpoint (Birthdays query). This can be used for information disclosure of anything in the database, including user credentials. |
| [CVE-2023-38765](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ChurchCRM/CVE-2023-38765) | A SQL injection vulnerability in ChurchCRM v.5.0.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive database information via the `membermonth` parameter within the `/QueryView.php?QueryID=22` endpoint (Membership Anniversaries query). This can be used for information disclosure of anything in the database, including user credentials. |
| [CVE-2023-38766](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ChurchCRM/CVE-2023-38766) | A cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ChurchCRM v5.0.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted payload to the `PersonView.php` endpoint. An authenticated attacker can perform stored XSS by editing their user profile. This payload is triggered whenever anyone views this user's profile. This vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's session, perform information disclosure, or potentially perform other CSRF attacks. |
| [CVE-2023-38767](https://github.com/0x72303074/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ChurchCRM/CVE-2023-38767) | A SQL injection vulnerability in ChurchCRM v.5.0.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive database information via the `value` and `custom` parameters within the `/QueryView.php?QueryID=200` endpoint (CustomSearch query).
