Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1390

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `creating_pricing_table_page` function of the Paid Membership Subscriptions plugin. This function allows users to create pricing tables, but it lacks a proper capability check to ensure only authorized users can perform this action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a capability check on the `creating_pricing_table_page` function. This allows users with insufficient privileges to create pricing tables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Authenticated users, even with subscriber-level access, can create pricing tables, which is intended for administrative roles. This could lead to unwanted content creation, potential disruption of site layout, and confusion for legitimate users, which is an unintended modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `creating_pricing_table_page` function. An attacker would need to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site, with a minimum of subscriber access.
- **Network Access:** Requires network access to the WordPress site to submit malicious request

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `includes/admin/class-admin-subscription-plans.php` file in the plugin.
- The fix involves adding a nonce check and user capability check to the `creating_pricing_table_page` function to prevent unauthorized access.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Wordfence article provides a clear explanation of the vulnerability and its impact.
- The WordPress.org Trac link shows the code changes made to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.11.2 of the plugin.
