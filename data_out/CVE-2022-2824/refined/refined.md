    {
      "source": "github.com_884d61a7_20250108_112233.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles properties in the `Criteria.php` file, specifically when checking for the length of properties before using them in SQL queries. The code uses `strlen($this->$prop)` which could lead to errors if the property is not set. The fix implemented replaces `strlen($this->$prop)` with `strlen($this->$prop ?? '')` to avoid errors when dealing with unset properties.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Potential PHP errors due to accessing unset object properties."
      ],
      "impact": "The original code may generate errors, potentially causing unexpected behavior or denial of service.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting specific requests that rely on the condition of unset properties."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger code execution that relies on the affected `Criteria.php` file. This requires some understanding of the application logic, where the class is used."
