- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by directly accessing the vulnerable function without proper authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user.
