- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SendPress Newsletters plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically the 'Read More override' parameter within the plugin's advanced settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to the ability to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's admin settings page. A high-privileged user, such as an admin, can inject malicious JavaScript code by modifying the 'Read More override' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative access or other high-level privileges to access the plugin's settings page within the WordPress dashboard. The attacker doesn't need unfiltered_html capability, and this vulnerability can be exploited even in a multisite setup.
