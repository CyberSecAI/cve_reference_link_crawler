{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Thingsboard platform attempts to handle a large response from a device's RPC server, leading to resource exhaustion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper handling of excessively large responses from an RPC server, leading to resource exhaustion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The Thingsboard platform experiences Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors and eventually crashes, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by configuring a device's RPC server to return a large amount of data in response to a request initiated through the Thingsboard platform.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have control over a device that can host an RPC server that is connected to the Thingsboard platform."
