{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the ipoib_mcast_join_task() function. This function releases the priv->lock while iterating through the priv->multicast_list. This opens a window for ipoib_mcast_dev_flush() to remove items from the list concurrently. If an mcast entry is removed during the iteration, the for loop can spin indefinitely, leading to a hard lockup.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Improper locking",
      "Use-after-free (indirectly)"
     ],
    "impact": "A hard lockup of the system, requiring a reboot to recover.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by actions that cause concurrent execution of  ipoib_mcast_join_task() and ipoib_mcast_dev_flush(). This likely involves network operations such as joining/leaving multicast groups and device flushing.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker would need to trigger actions that cause concurrent calls to `ipoib_mcast_join_task` and `ipoib_mcast_dev_flush`. Specific actions or configuration depend on the environment (e.g., RHEL 4.18.0-372.75.1.el8_6 was reported).  No root/admin privileges are explicitly mentioned as a prerequisite, but the ability to manipulate network interfaces is likely needed."
  },
  "resolution": "The fix involves holding the lock during the entire iteration process and changing memory allocation to GFP_ATOMIC to prevent sleeps and thus the lock from being dropped.",
  "cve": "CVE-2023-52587"
