**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Credentials within exported configuration files are accessible to malicious actors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A malicious actor who gains access to an exported configuration file can obtain stored credentials.
-  Compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to the protected resource.
- If the same passwords were used for other resources, further such assets may be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to obtain an exported configuration file to extract stored credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to have some form of access that allows them to obtain an exported configuration file from the device. This may involve network access or local system access.
