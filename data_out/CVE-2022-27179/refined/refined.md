The provided content is related to CVE-2022-27179.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficiently protected credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Credentials, stored in an exported configuration file, are not sufficiently protected. A malicious actor with access to the exported file can obtain the stored credentials and gain access to the protected resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation can lead to the compromise of the protected resource and potentially other resources if the same passwords were used. Specifically, an attacker can gain access to the protected resource and other assets if the same passwords were used.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker needs access to the exported configuration file to obtain stored credentials. The configuration file can be obtained via network access to the system or physical access to the file storage location.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the exported configuration file which may be obtained through network access or through physical access. It's not specified that any other privilege is required. Access to the configuration file could be obtained through a compromised system with access to the Red Lion device.
