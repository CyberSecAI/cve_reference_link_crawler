Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-3996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `libmount` library within `util-linux`, specifically how it parses `/proc/self/mountinfo`.
- The library blindly removes the " (deleted)" suffix from mountpoint pathnames when parsing `/proc/self/mountinfo`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Path Handling:** The vulnerability stems from the incorrect parsing of mount paths, where the library strips the " (deleted)" suffix. This allows for targeting of mount points that are not normally accessible to the unprivileged user.
- **Insufficient access control:** The vulnerable code does not properly check ownership or permissions when processing mount points.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Unmount:** An unprivileged user can unmount file systems that are world-writable (e.g., `/tmp`) or mounted in a world-writable directory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By unmounting a critical file system like `/tmp`, an attacker can cause a denial of service, disrupting applications relying on those file systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Mount Manipulation:**  The attacker needs to create a mount point with a target path that includes `(deleted)` suffix.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** An attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- **Basic system interaction:** The attacker would use the `mount` command to create a FUSE file system and the `umount` command to trigger the vulnerability.
- **FUSE knowledge:** The attacker would need a basic understanding of FUSE file systems to create a mount point.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in `util-linux` commit `5fea669` ("libmount: Support unmount FUSE mounts") in November 2018.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version `2.37.3`.
- The issue was discovered by Qualys Security Advisory.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entry [2024628](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024628) also discusses the vulnerability.
- The issue allows the unmount of filesystems that are world-writable or mounted in world-writable directories and it is related to parsing `/proc/self/mountinfo`
