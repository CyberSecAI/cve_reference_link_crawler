| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2024628#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-11-18 14:20:47 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in util-linux's libmount. An issue related to parsing the /proc/self/mountinfo file allows an unprivileged user to unmount other users' filesystems that are either world-writable themselves (like /tmp) or mounted in a world-writable directory.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2024628#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-11-19 16:09:56 UTC  ``` RHEL 6, 7 and 8 are not affected by this bug as they ship an older version of util-linux which does not allow unprivileged users to unmount FUSE mount points for the current user (e.g. is_fuse_usermount() function does not exist).   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2024628#c12)  Riccardo Schirone    2022-01-24 11:08:40 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/commit/166e87368ae88bf31112a30e078cceae637f4cdb>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2024628#c13)  Riccardo Schirone    2022-01-24 11:10:06 UTC  ``` Release notes: <https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.37/v2.37.3-ReleaseNotes>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2024628#c14)  Riccardo Schirone    2022-01-24 12:01:37 UTC  ``` Created util-linux tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2044307](show_bug.cgi?id=2044307 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3996 util-linux: Unauthorized unmount of filesystems in libmount [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2024628#c16)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-17 15:16:44 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3996>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2024628#c17)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2023-09-15 01:50:04 UTC  ``` The needinfo request[s] on this closed bug have been removed as they have been unresolved for 365 days   ``` |  |
