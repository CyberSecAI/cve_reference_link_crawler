Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of a limit on the number of tokens parsed in GraphQL queries. This allows an attacker to craft a query with a large number of duplicated fields, leading to excessive resource consumption on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted GraphQL Query Complexity:** The primary weakness is the absence of a mechanism to limit the complexity of GraphQL queries, specifically regarding the number of tokens being parsed. This allows for field duplication attacks.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows for a denial-of-service attack by overwhelming the server with computationally intensive queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Service Unavailability:** Successful exploitation leads to the server becoming unresponsive, causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The attack causes excessive consumption of server resources, leading to performance degradation and potential service crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/graphql` endpoint.
- **GraphQL API:** The attack leverages the GraphQL API to send a malicious query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic Understanding of GraphQL:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct GraphQL queries with duplicated fields.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability, as no special permissions are required to send the crafted queries.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the Directus application, specifically in how it handles GraphQL queries.
- The fix involves adding a configurable limit (`GRAPHQL_QUERY_TOKEN_LIMIT`) to the number of tokens parsed when processing GraphQL queries. This limit is set to 5000 by default.
- The patch introduces a `maxTokens` option in the GraphQL parser to limit the number of tokens, preventing excessively large queries from being processed.
- The vulnerability is located in the `/api/src/middleware/graphql.ts` file, and the fix is implemented by adding the maxTokens option when parsing the query with the `graphql-js` library

**Code Snippets:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a GraphQL query where fields are massively duplicated, as seen in the provided PoC example:
```
{'query': 'query { query_4f4722ea: test_table_aggregated { max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } max {id id id id id id id id id id } } }'}
```
- The fix includes changes in `api/src/middleware/graphql.ts` which introduces the `maxTokens` setting to the parser:
```
 document = parse(new Source(query), {
        maxTokens: Number(env['GRAPHQL_QUERY_TOKEN_LIMIT']),
      });
```

**CVSS Metrics:**
- CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.5
- Attack Vector: Network
- Attack Complexity: Low
- Privileges Required: Low
- User Interaction: None
- Scope: Unchanged
- Confidentiality: None
- Integrity: None
- Availability: High
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-39895

**CWE:** CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)

In summary, CVE-2024-39895 is a moderate severity vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted GraphQL queries with duplicated fields, leading to excessive resource consumption. The fix introduces a limit on the number of tokens parsed in GraphQL queries.
