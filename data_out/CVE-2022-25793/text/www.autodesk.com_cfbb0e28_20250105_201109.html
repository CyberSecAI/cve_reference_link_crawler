## Autodesk Trust Center

### Security advisory

Advisories are used to communicate information related to vulnerabilities identified with Autodesk® products and services. This includes any fixes or workarounds that are applicable to the affected product.

## ActionScript Byte Code “ABC” Vulnerabilities in the Autodesk® FBX® Review and Autodesk® 3ds Max® software

---

**Autodesk ID:** ADSK-SA-2022-0006

**Product, Service, Component:** Autodesk® FBX® Review, Autodesk® 3ds Max®

**Impact:** Out-Of-Bounds Read

**Severity:** High

**Original Publish:** 2/28/2022

**Last Revised:** 7/20/2022

| Severity | CVSS Score | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | A vulnerability where scope and impact of exploitation is restricted and the ability to exploit is extremely difficult. |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | A vulnerability where exploitation is mitigated by factors such as difficulty to exploit, default configuration or ease of identification. |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | A vulnerability, which if exploited, would directly impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of user's data or processing resources. |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10 | A vulnerability, which if exploited, would allow remote execution of malicious code without user action. |

### Summary

Applications and services utilizing the Autodesk FBX Review and 3ds Max have been affected by an Out-Of-Bounds Read and Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to code execution and/or denial-of-service.

### Description

The details of the vulnerabilities are as follows:

1. [CVE-2022-25794](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25794) - An Out-Of-Bounds Read Vulnerability in Autodesk FBX Review version 1.5.2 and prior may lead to code execution or information disclosure through maliciously crafted ActionScript Byte Code “ABC” files. ABC files are created by the Flash compiler and contain executable code. This vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities could lead to code execution in the context of the current process.
2. [CVE-2022-25793](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25793) - A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files. This vulnerability may allow arbitrary code execution on affected installations of Autodesk 3ds Max.
