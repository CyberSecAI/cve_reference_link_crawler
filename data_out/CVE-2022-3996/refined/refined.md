Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-3996

**Root Cause:**
A malformed policy constraint in an X.509 certificate, when policy processing is enabled, causes a write lock to be taken recursively.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Recursive write lock acquisition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). On some operating systems, particularly Windows, this results in a process hang.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor provides an X.509 certificate with a malformed policy constraint.
- The target system must have policy processing enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted X.509 certificate to a system using a vulnerable OpenSSL version with policy processing enabled.
- Policy processing must be enabled either by using the `-policy` argument in command-line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.7.
- OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.
- The severity is considered "Low" by OpenSSL.
- NetApp rates the severity as HIGH, with a CVSS score of 7.5
- NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of OpenSSL are also affected.
- A fix is available in OpenSSL commit `7725e7bfe`.
- NetApp has provided patches for affected products.
- A workaround for NetApp ONTAP systems is to disable SAML.
