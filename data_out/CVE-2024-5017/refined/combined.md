# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1932

## Progress Software Corporation WhatsUp Gold AppProfileImport path traversal vulnerability

##### June 26, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-5017

##### SUMMARY

A path traversal vulnerability exists in the AppProfileImport functionality of Progress Software Corporation WhatsUp Gold 23.1.0 Build 1697. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to information disclosure. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Progress Software Corporation WhatsUp Gold 23.1.0 Build 1697

##### PRODUCT URLS

WhatsUp Gold - <https://www.whatsupgold.com/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

6.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

WhatsUp Gold is a network monitoring and management software developed by Progress. WhatsUp Gold is designed to provide visibility into IT infrastructure, allowing organizations to monitor the performance and health of networks, devices, servers, applications, and other critical components. It offers features such as network mapping, performance monitoring, alerting, and reporting to help IT professionals ensure the optimal functioning of their network infrastructure.

An authenticated user can upload a new `Application profile` definition file (xml) for `monitoring` triggering the following actions :

```
Settings - > Application monitoring - > Application and profile setup - > Application Profiles -> Import

```

Let us take a look at controler implementation responsible for handling this action:

```
Apm.UI\Apm\UI\Areas\APM\Controllers\Api\Applications\AppProfileImportController.cs

Line 1 	namespace Apm.UI.Areas.APM.Controllers.Api.Applications
Line 2 	{
Line 3 		public class AppProfileImportController : ApplicationControllerBase
Line 4 		{
Line 5
Line 6 		(...)
Line 7
Line 8 			public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Post(string fileName, int uploadOption)
Line 9 			{
Line 10
Line 11				(...)
Line 12
Line 13				if (uploadOption == 0 && File.Exists(getPath(fileName)))
Line 14				{
Line 15					return getResponse(new ResultModel
Line 16					{
Line 17						message = "FILE_EXISTS",
Line 18						success = false
Line 19					});
Line 20				}
Line 21			}
Line 22
Line 23			private string getPath(string fileName = null)
Line 24			{
Line 25				string text = HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/Content/Apm/Import");
Line 26				if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(fileName))
Line 27				{
Line 28					return Path.Combine(text, fileName);
Line 29				}
Line 30				return text;
Line 31			}

```

Apparent from the above is that the `fileName` argument is fully controlled by an attacker and is used in `File.Exists` function argument at `line 15`.
We can also observe that there is no path traversal protection implemented inside `getPath` function `line 22` and directly controlled `fileName` value is just combined with usage of `Path.Combine` function `line 27`.
Such conditions allows the attacker to conduct path traversal attack and check an existence of any file within the file system.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

An attacker needs to be authenticated and send the follwing request

```
