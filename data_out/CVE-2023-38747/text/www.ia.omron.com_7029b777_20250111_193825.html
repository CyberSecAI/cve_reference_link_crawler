■Mitigations and Protections

OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the

risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

    1. Anti-virus measure

Installation of the latest commercial-quality anti-virus software in your computer that is

connected to the control systems

    2. Prevention of Unauthorized Access

・  Keeping the minimal connection of the control systems and equipment to the network

and forbiting access from unreliable devices

・  Isolation from the IT network via a firewall (Disabling unused communication ports,

Limiting the number of communication hosts）

・  Use of a virtual private network (VPN) when remotely accessing to the control systems

・  Strong passwords and frequent changes to them

・  Adoption of physical security control that allows only an authorized person to access

the control systems and equipment

・  Virus check for external storage devices such as USBs before using them in the control

systems and equipment

・  Applying multi-factor authentication to the control systems and equipment

3. Protection of Input and Output Data

Assuring backup and range check validity in case of unintentional modification of data

input to and output from the control systems and equipment

4. Restoration of Lost Data

            Periodic backup and maintenance of setting data to prevent loss of data
