I’m literally just waking up and reading the comments here. I’m new to this issue and happy to commit us to move to doing this locally in the browser and will have us move on that ASAP. That said, I want to be clear that we did not and have not collected any personal information here. As other staff have referenced, our services are encrypted and throw away PII like IP addresses by design. However, I take the point that it is nevertheless safer to do it locally and so we will do that. | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [pelliphant](user?id=pelliphant) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711642)   | [next](#23711716) [–]  Thank you, this is the response people here want to hear.

It was a forgivable-but-negligent decision to write/approve that code in the first place. It was a sign of a bad process that a reported security vulnerability was not escalated to people security-conscious enough to immediately identify this as a major problem. I don't agree with the outrage. Anyone who has followed DDG knows they're legit. They just need to do a bit better. They probably will. Their main feature is privacy. They should be at least as sensitive to privacy vulnerabilities as their most aware users. DDG should announce that they now pay out privacy-related vulnerabilities like this and send the reporter $5k. It would be good honest PR and well worth the expense. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jiofih](user?id=jiofih) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23716183)   | [root](#23711642) | [parent](#23714553) | [next](#23714305) [–]  Correct me if I’m wrong, but by default DDG uses redirects to prevent leaking your search queries through the referrer, so they already can technically see every URL you visit.

At what point did we stop taking people's word and commitment as valid? Sure, I too want to see proof that they are doing the right thing here (because I don't understand the design decisions that led to the creation of that service in the first place), but because these changes are not immediate, this statement does at least answer *some* of the questions I personally had (Like "will this be fixed"? "when"?). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [boogies](user?id=boogies) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23727174)   | [root](#23711716) | [parent](#23712128) | [next](#23714408) [–]  > At what point did we stop taking people's word and commitment as valid? At the point that they where caught violating privacy while claiming to respect it, and standing to make a profit off of violating it. If I trusted people as blindly as people seem to trust DuckDuckGo, I would have trusted Google to not be evil and never have switched to DDG in the first place.

In fact, we didn't (and don't in general) collect any user-level data in the first place, per our strict privacy policy: <https://duckduckgo.com/privacy> In this case, the way it works is you hit our favicon service and it returns the favicon, not using any PII in the process, and our web servers are configured not to log any PII.

However, this problem demonstrates gross incompotence for a browser team supposedly concerned with privacy. Will you please do a post-mortem on how this code made it through your code review process in the first place, as well as how it managed to stay in place for a full year after it was pointed out that it represented a privacy problem? "Sends every URL you visit to the vendor's servers" is the *single worst thing* DuckDuckGo could have done for privacy in this web browser, and that needs to be accounted for. There was a major failure in the code review process, ticket review process, and in how you treat your community. A standard marketroid "by design" response with washy promises that "we'll take very good care of this highly sensitive personal data, just trust us" is not something I want to see in the future from this team.

This is absolutely not an example of gross incompetence. I agree that for a company built around privacy even the appearance of impropriety needs to be avoided. DDG holds themselves to a higher standard and their users hold them to a higher standard. This was a design flaw and a process flaw. DDG prioritized speed and efficiency over privacy (or in this case, perceived privacy) and I suspect there isn’t a soul on HN who hasn’t made that trade off at some point. They assessed the cost/benefit and risk/reward and it turned out their assessment was wrong. Now they’re fixing it. It happens. But to call this gross incompetence is really blowing it completely out of proportion. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ddevault](user?id=ddevault) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712979)   | [root](#23712835) | [parent](#23712942) | [next](#23713761) [–]  I'm not blowing it out of proportion. This one specific "design flaw", if we're being generous, has been raised many times with many different browser vendors and add-on vendors as a very bad thing that you cannot do. There is plentiful wisdom on this issue. The first rule of privacy is never handle the private data in the first place. An accidental leak is one thing, but deliberately designing a feature whose side effect is exfiltrating heaps of private data, then doubling down on it *for a year* after it's pointed out to you, then doubling down *again* when it's raised on HN - this *is* gross incompetence. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [akerl\_](user?id=akerl_) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713761)   | [parent](#23712835) | [prev](#23712942) | [next](#23716156) [–]  You can’t think of anything they could have done that would be worse than sending URLs to their lookup server? It’s the single worst thing? My browser syncs URL history between my devices, and that’s a feature that I value about it.

Considering they have operations in the EU, I would imagine that would fall under what the GDPR considers personal information (<https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/>), or risk being in breach of it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Terretta](user?id=Terretta) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712028)   | [prev](#23712524) | [next](#23711732) [–]  To be more clear, your staff, and you, have said PII ‘like IP addresses’, and have said ‘thrown away’ some places and ‘not collected’ others. Contrary to this framing, it’s not possible to not incidentally become aware of every single browser users’ usage timing and user IP addresses if the browsers are phoning home this way — a colloquial understanding of ‘collect’, not the James Clapper NSA dodge definition of ‘collect’. Most normals think of collect as become known not as permanently store. You knowing it means others can know it if you break trust or are required to comply with authorities. And regardless of end-to-end encryption, that this user is phoning home to your fave icon endpoint, when, and from what IP, is revealed to every ISP in the chain. You’re leaking browser usage telemetry to every single party to that traffic — the source IP address PII you mention is in unencrypted metadata. The fact this browser connects to that endpoint reveals demographics (choice of privacy browser) and behaviors (when and how much web surfing) to e.g. ISP or nation state firewall operators who are certainly not bound by your ‘just trust us’ privacy policy. Privacy policies are a patch for insufficient privacy engineering. To be a strong privacy browser you could consider what it would take to be “NSL proof” such that if handed a national security letter with gag order, you *cannot* comply. That is not the case with this faveicon telemetry endpoint. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [0xfate](user?id=0xfate) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713796)   | [parent](#23712028) | [next](#23711732) [–]  Just to be fair, as a matter of fact, you surfing that site is revealing you, surfing that site to your ISP and state actors, in the first place. A change, where to get the icon from (origin vs ddg), will not change this fact. It is all about ddg not getting to know, which sites you are surfing, when not searching for it on ddg. Which should, indeed, be a no-brainer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Terretta](user?id=Terretta) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23724715)   | [root](#23712028) | [parent](#23713796) | [next](#23711732) [–]  "You surfing that site" not adding a single surveillance point for every user of a particular browser, it's not compromising your other privacy measures (e.g, VPN that prevents your ISP from knowing) by sending your site surfing data out to that surveillance point, etc. Getting the icon from each site means surveillance would have to be at origin or every site, while telemetry going to DDG gives a single surveillance point. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [\_hl\_](user?id=_hl_) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711732)   | [prev](#23712028) [–]  I've already posted this somewhere else, but I'll copy it here again as well: It's not immediately obvious whether it is more privacy preserving if the client automatically makes a request to each site in the search results while scrolling through the results, especially since you're already trusting DDG when performing the search. Maybe this should be an opt-in rather than an opt-out feature? All in all its really not as big of an issue as people here make it out to be. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [warpspin](user?id=warpspin) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711757)   | [parent](#23711732) | [next](#23711752) [–]  This was not about search results, where their favicon webservice is in fact privacy increasing, but about the privacy browser and the favicons it displays, where it is privacy decreasing as it involved sending information about visited sites to a central authority while you are not on the DDG search engine. For example the TabRenderer will fetch the favicons from DDG instead of from the site you are actually visiting: [https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/blob/db728523240e37727...](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/blob/db728523240e377277deb88af71d751eb8bdb5dd/app/src/main/java/com/duckduckgo/app/tabs/ui/TabRendererExtension.kt) Anyway, great decision by Gabriel. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mthoms](user?id=mthoms) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713260)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23711757) | [next](#23711763) [–]  Thanks for pointing out that the service was already in use on their search results pages. To me, this goes a long way toward explaining how this could have happened: Scenario #1 - *"We need to show favicons in our browser tabs. Lets develop an API that requires every domain be sent to us!"* Scenario #2 - *"We need to show favicons in our browser tabs. Hey look, we've already got a service that provides this. We know it collects no PII and our users trust it already."* Obviously the second scenario is flawed thinking, because (of course) it's better to not send that info at all. However, I can easily see how their developer(s) may have arrived at the conclusion that this is still compliant with their privacy ethos. The fact that the favicon service already existed (and was trusted by users) before this was implemented, makes it much easier to understand how this could have been a legitimate mistake and thus, they deserve the benefit of the doubt. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [warpspin](user?id=warpspin) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23721497)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23713260) | [next](#23711763) [–]  Yes, it is a totally plausible mistake. The fault was "only" ignoring it after it was reported. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [\_hl\_](user?id=_hl_) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711763)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23711757) | [prev](#23713260) | [next](#23711752) [–]  Ah I guess I should have read TFA l, because search results have a similar feature (that is opt-out). For a browser I agree it makes more sense to get the icon directly from the site being visited without any privacy risks. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [epi0Bauqu](user?id=epi0Bauqu) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711752)   | [parent](#23711732) | [prev](#23711757) | [next](#23711788) [–]  Yes, after consulting with staff, I understand we thought it was more privacy protecting because we know our services are already encrypted and throw away PII, and so to get the favicon you could either (a) make another request to our known anonymous service or (b) make a request (or possibly multiple) to a non-anonymous service. On the other hand it is another request to a distinct domain that traverses another path on the Internet, albeit an encrypted one. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [classified](user?id=classified) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711788)   | [parent](#23711732) | [prev](#23711752) [–]  > not as big of an issue as people here make it out to be.

Everyone should decide for themselves how big of an issue it is for them and not one person who just shrugs it off. That person made their statement sound like a universal fact. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sokoloff](user?id=sokoloff) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713063)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23712605) [–]  I think the most charitable (and probably the default) reading of that clause has an implied "I believe" prepended. It certainly does not have an implied "It is a universal fact that" prepended. By way of analogy, when you earlier said "This is ludicrous. Can we switch to the metric system already?" no one thinks that you're speaking for everyone, but rather are advancing your own belief in the "This is ludicrous." sentence. <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23660985> | | --- | --- | --- | | |
