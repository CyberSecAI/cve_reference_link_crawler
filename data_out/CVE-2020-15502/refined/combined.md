I’m literally just waking up and reading the comments here. I’m new to this issue and happy to commit us to move to doing this locally in the browser and will have us move on that ASAP. That said, I want to be clear that we did not and have not collected any personal information here. As other staff have referenced, our services are encrypted and throw away PII like IP addresses by design. However, I take the point that it is nevertheless safer to do it locally and so we will do that. | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [pelliphant](user?id=pelliphant) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711642)   | [next](#23711716) [–]  Thank you, this is the response people here want to hear.

It's "We made this design decision, thought you would like it -- we've learnt, changed, and will avoid it later". Can you imagine Google doing something similar?

It was a forgivable-but-negligent decision to write/approve that code in the first place. It was a sign of a bad process that a reported security vulnerability was not escalated to people security-conscious enough to immediately identify this as a major problem. I don't agree with the outrage. Anyone who has followed DDG knows they're legit. They just need to do a bit better. They probably will. Their main feature is privacy. They should be at least as sensitive to privacy vulnerabilities as their most aware users. DDG should announce that they now pay out privacy-related vulnerabilities like this and send the reporter $5k. It would be good honest PR and well worth the expense. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jiofih](user?id=jiofih) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23716183)   | [root](#23711642) | [parent](#23714553) | [next](#23714305) [–]  Correct me if I’m wrong, but by default DDG uses redirects to prevent leaking your search queries through the referrer, so they already can technically see every URL you visit.

At what point did we stop taking people's word and commitment as valid? Sure, I too want to see proof that they are doing the right thing here (because I don't understand the design decisions that led to the creation of that service in the first place), but because these changes are not immediate, this statement does at least answer *some* of the questions I personally had (Like "will this be fixed"? "when"?). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [boogies](user?id=boogies) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23727174)   | [root](#23711716) | [parent](#23712128) | [next](#23714408) [–]  > At what point did we stop taking people's word and commitment as valid? At the point that they where caught violating privacy while claiming to respect it, and standing to make a profit off of violating it. If I trusted people as blindly as people seem to trust DuckDuckGo, I would have trusted Google to not be evil and never have switched to DDG in the first place.

In fact, we didn't (and don't in general) collect any user-level data in the first place, per our strict privacy policy: <https://duckduckgo.com/privacy> In this case, the way it works is you hit our favicon service and it returns the favicon, not using any PII in the process, and our web servers are configured not to log any PII.

However, this problem demonstrates gross incompotence for a browser team supposedly concerned with privacy. Will you please do a post-mortem on how this code made it through your code review process in the first place, as well as how it managed to stay in place for a full year after it was pointed out that it represented a privacy problem? "Sends every URL you visit to the vendor's servers" is the *single worst thing* DuckDuckGo could have done for privacy in this web browser, and that needs to be accounted for. There was a major failure in the code review process, ticket review process, and in how you treat your community. A standard marketroid "by design" response with washy promises that "we'll take very good care of this highly sensitive personal data, just trust us" is not something I want to see in the future from this team.

This is absolutely not an example of gross incompetence. I agree that for a company built around privacy even the appearance of impropriety needs to be avoided. DDG holds themselves to a higher standard and their users hold them to a higher standard. This was a design flaw and a process flaw. DDG prioritized speed and efficiency over privacy (or in this case, perceived privacy) and I suspect there isn’t a soul on HN who hasn’t made that trade off at some point. They assessed the cost/benefit and risk/reward and it turned out their assessment was wrong. Now they’re fixing it. It happens. But to call this gross incompetence is really blowing it completely out of proportion. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ddevault](user?id=ddevault) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712979)   | [root](#23712835) | [parent](#23712942) | [next](#23713761) [–]  I'm not blowing it out of proportion. This one specific "design flaw", if we're being generous, has been raised many times with many different browser vendors and add-on vendors as a very bad thing that you cannot do. There is plentiful wisdom on this issue. The first rule of privacy is never handle the private data in the first place. An accidental leak is one thing, but deliberately designing a feature whose side effect is exfiltrating heaps of private data, then doubling down on it *for a year* after it's pointed out to you, then doubling down *again* when it's raised on HN - this *is* gross incompetence. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [akerl\_](user?id=akerl_) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713761)   | [parent](#23712835) | [prev](#23712942) | [next](#23716156) [–]  You can’t think of anything they could have done that would be worse than sending URLs to their lookup server? It’s the single worst thing? My browser syncs URL history between my devices, and that’s a feature that I value about it.

It actually increases privacy there, DDG already know what domains your search returnedy and the alternative would be fetching favicons directly from websites, leaking information to them before even clicking.

Considering they have operations in the EU, I would imagine that would fall under what the GDPR considers personal information (<https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/>), or risk being in breach of it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Terretta](user?id=Terretta) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712028)   | [prev](#23712524) | [next](#23711732) [–]  To be more clear, your staff, and you, have said PII ‘like IP addresses’, and have said ‘thrown away’ some places and ‘not collected’ others. Contrary to this framing, it’s not possible to not incidentally become aware of every single browser users’ usage timing and user IP addresses if the browsers are phoning home this way — a colloquial understanding of ‘collect’, not the James Clapper NSA dodge definition of ‘collect’. Most normals think of collect as become known not as permanently store. You knowing it means others can know it if you break trust or are required to comply with authorities. And regardless of end-to-end encryption, that this user is phoning home to your fave icon endpoint, when, and from what IP, is revealed to every ISP in the chain. You’re leaking browser usage telemetry to every single party to that traffic — the source IP address PII you mention is in unencrypted metadata. The fact this browser connects to that endpoint reveals demographics (choice of privacy browser) and behaviors (when and how much web surfing) to e.g. ISP or nation state firewall operators who are certainly not bound by your ‘just trust us’ privacy policy. Privacy policies are a patch for insufficient privacy engineering. To be a strong privacy browser you could consider what it would take to be “NSL proof” such that if handed a national security letter with gag order, you *cannot* comply. That is not the case with this faveicon telemetry endpoint. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [0xfate](user?id=0xfate) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713796)   | [parent](#23712028) | [next](#23711732) [–]  Just to be fair, as a matter of fact, you surfing that site is revealing you, surfing that site to your ISP and state actors, in the first place. A change, where to get the icon from (origin vs ddg), will not change this fact. It is all about ddg not getting to know, which sites you are surfing, when not searching for it on ddg. Which should, indeed, be a no-brainer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Terretta](user?id=Terretta) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23724715)   | [root](#23712028) | [parent](#23713796) | [next](#23711732) [–]  "You surfing that site" not adding a single surveillance point for every user of a particular browser, it's not compromising your other privacy measures (e.g, VPN that prevents your ISP from knowing) by sending your site surfing data out to that surveillance point, etc. Getting the icon from each site means surveillance would have to be at origin or every site, while telemetry going to DDG gives a single surveillance point. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [\_hl\_](user?id=_hl_) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711732)   | [prev](#23712028) [–]  I've already posted this somewhere else, but I'll copy it here again as well: It's not immediately obvious whether it is more privacy preserving if the client automatically makes a request to each site in the search results while scrolling through the results, especially since you're already trusting DDG when performing the search. Maybe this should be an opt-in rather than an opt-out feature? All in all its really not as big of an issue as people here make it out to be. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [warpspin](user?id=warpspin) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711757)   | [parent](#23711732) | [next](#23711752) [–]  This was not about search results, where their favicon webservice is in fact privacy increasing, but about the privacy browser and the favicons it displays, where it is privacy decreasing as it involved sending information about visited sites to a central authority while you are not on the DDG search engine. For example the TabRenderer will fetch the favicons from DDG instead of from the site you are actually visiting: [https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/blob/db728523240e37727...](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/blob/db728523240e377277deb88af71d751eb8bdb5dd/app/src/main/java/com/duckduckgo/app/tabs/ui/TabRendererExtension.kt) Anyway, great decision by Gabriel. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mthoms](user?id=mthoms) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713260)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23711757) | [next](#23711763) [–]  Thanks for pointing out that the service was already in use on their search results pages. To me, this goes a long way toward explaining how this could have happened: Scenario #1 - *"We need to show favicons in our browser tabs. Lets develop an API that requires every domain be sent to us!"* Scenario #2 - *"We need to show favicons in our browser tabs. Hey look, we've already got a service that provides this. We know it collects no PII and our users trust it already."* Obviously the second scenario is flawed thinking, because (of course) it's better to not send that info at all. However, I can easily see how their developer(s) may have arrived at the conclusion that this is still compliant with their privacy ethos. The fact that the favicon service already existed (and was trusted by users) before this was implemented, makes it much easier to understand how this could have been a legitimate mistake and thus, they deserve the benefit of the doubt. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [warpspin](user?id=warpspin) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23721497)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23713260) | [next](#23711763) [–]  Yes, it is a totally plausible mistake. The fault was "only" ignoring it after it was reported. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [\_hl\_](user?id=_hl_) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711763)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23711757) | [prev](#23713260) | [next](#23711752) [–]  Ah I guess I should have read TFA l, because search results have a similar feature (that is opt-out). For a browser I agree it makes more sense to get the icon directly from the site being visited without any privacy risks. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [epi0Bauqu](user?id=epi0Bauqu) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711752)   | [parent](#23711732) | [prev](#23711757) | [next](#23711788) [–]  Yes, after consulting with staff, I understand we thought it was more privacy protecting because we know our services are already encrypted and throw away PII, and so to get the favicon you could either (a) make another request to our known anonymous service or (b) make a request (or possibly multiple) to a non-anonymous service. On the other hand it is another request to a distinct domain that traverses another path on the Internet, albeit an encrypted one. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [classified](user?id=classified) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711788)   | [parent](#23711732) | [prev](#23711752) [–]  > not as big of an issue as people here make it out to be. Please refrain from speaking for others without being asked to. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sokoloff](user?id=sokoloff) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712234)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23711788) [–]  I don’t think that line is speaking for others. It is characterizing what others are *actually saying*. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [classified](user?id=classified) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712605)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23712234) [–]  Exactly. Everyone should decide for themselves how big of an issue it is for them and not one person who just shrugs it off. That person made their statement sound like a universal fact. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sokoloff](user?id=sokoloff) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713063)   | [root](#23711732) | [parent](#23712605) [–]  I think the most charitable (and probably the default) reading of that clause has an implied "I believe" prepended. It certainly does not have an implied "It is a universal fact that" prepended. By way of analogy, when you earlier said "This is ludicrous. Can we switch to the metric system already?" no one thinks that you're speaking for everyone, but rather are advancing your own belief in the "This is ludicrous." sentence. <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23660985> | | --- | --- | --- | | |

I’m literally just waking up and reading the comments here. I’m new to this issue and happy to commit us to move to doing this locally in the browser and will have us move on that ASAP. That said, I want to be clear that we did not and have not collected any personal information here. As other staff have referenced, our services are encrypted and throw away PII like IP addresses by design. However, I take the point that it is nevertheless safer to do it locally and so we will do that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [pelliphant](user?id=pelliphant) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711642)   | [parent](#23711597) | [next](#23711716) [–]  Thank you, this is the response people here want to hear. And if this gets fixed in a reasonable timeframe, this is just one of those "everyone makes a mistake one in a while"-things, no big deal. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [azalemeth](user?id=azalemeth) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711665)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711642) | [next](#23714957) [–]  If anything, it's *much better* than 'no big deal'. It's "We made this design decision, thought you would like it -- we've learnt, changed, and will avoid it later". Can you imagine Google doing something similar? Heck, they're just about to throw the Android rooting community under a hardware-attestation DRM-filled bus. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bluesign](user?id=bluesign) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711734)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711665) | [next](#23714553) [–]  More like we made a design decision, than someone warned us this is bad for privacy, we ignored, after 1 year it blew up on HN, now we are fixing it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [taneq](user?id=taneq) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23720340)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711734) | [next](#23713600) [–]  Could have been quicker but it's still far better than some smarmy non-apology and continuing as usual, which is sadly what we've come to accept. I don't think they've done too poorly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ayx](user?id=ayx) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713600)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711734) | [prev](#23720340) | [next](#23714553) [–]  That's exactly right.

It was a forgivable-but-negligent decision to write/approve that code in the first place. It was a sign of a bad process that a reported security vulnerability was not escalated to people security-conscious enough to immediately identify this as a major problem. I don't agree with the outrage. Anyone who has followed DDG knows they're legit. They just need to do a bit better. They probably will. Their main feature is privacy. They should be at least as sensitive to privacy vulnerabilities as their most aware users. DDG should announce that they now pay out privacy-related vulnerabilities like this and send the reporter $5k. It would be good honest PR and well worth the expense. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jiofih](user?id=jiofih) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23716183)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23714553) | [next](#23714305) [–]  Correct me if I’m wrong, but by default DDG uses redirects to prevent leaking your search queries through the referrer, so they already can technically see every URL you visit. Except their whole product and system is designed around protecting privacy and not storing that data. If the favicon endpoint respects the same rules (which it obviously does), it is no different. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sam0x17](user?id=sam0x17) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23716392)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23716183) | [next](#23714305) [–]  Except the favicon thing applies not just to searches on DDG, but every page you visit if you use this browser | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [seba\_dos1](user?id=seba_dos1) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23719169)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23716392) | [next](#23714305) [–]  Every domain.

That was really not very complex at all... Did they leave off some capabilities that the server side version performed, it was the complexity overstated? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bangonkeyboard](user?id=bangonkeyboard) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23718279)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23718118) | [next](#23711716) [–]  *> Did they leave off some capabilities that the server side version performed, it was the complexity overstated?* The former.

At what point did we stop taking people's word and commitment as valid? Sure, I too want to see proof that they are doing the right thing here (because I don't understand the design decisions that led to the creation of that service in the first place), but because these changes are not immediate, this statement does at least answer *some* of the questions I personally had (Like "will this be fixed"? "when"?). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [boogies](user?id=boogies) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23727174)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712128) | [next](#23714408) [–]  > At what point did we stop taking people's word and commitment as valid? At the point that they where caught violating privacy while claiming to respect it, and standing to make a profit off of violating it. If I trusted people as blindly as people seem to trust DuckDuckGo, I would have trusted Google to not be evil and never have switched to DDG in the first place. This breach of trust destroys the whole point of using it, so I switched my default search to Searx between reading this submission and writing this (had been procrastinating the switch for a while and this was exactly the motivation I needed). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [quotha](user?id=quotha) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23714408)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712128) | [prev](#23727174) | [next](#23713099) [–]  Well for me it was back in the 90’s | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chrispauley](user?id=chrispauley) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713099)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712005) | [prev](#23712128) | [next](#23717751) [–]  I will of course be keeping an eye on whether or not they follow through, but the admission of this being a problem and committing to fix it is -far- more than we see from most companies these days. Is it everything I ever could have wanted out of the company? no. However it is a positive direction I would like to see more of so displaying my appreciation is hopefully validation for the company to continue in that direction. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [olyjohn](user?id=olyjohn) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23717751)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712005) | [prev](#23713099) | [next](#23711666) [–]  Did you even read the post you replied to?

The issue here is I logged in to post the comment, and then switched to my laptop where I was already logged in this other account. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [worble](user?id=worble) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712416)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712332) | [next](#23720926) [–]  Good to know, I just wanted to be sure that someone wasn't attempting an impersonation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [shaper\_pmp](user?id=shaper_pmp) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23716788)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712416) | [next](#23720926) [–]  It was only a minor issue that got resolved quickly thanks to your question, but DDG's response to this whole issue of losing users' trust seems to be accurately characterised by the phrase "a succession of embarrassing own goals". :-/ | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TheSpiceIsLife](user?id=TheSpiceIsLife) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23720926)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712332) | [prev](#23712416) | [next](#23711761) [–]  Have you considered noting this in the user profile data of *this* HN account, then logging out of this one on your laptop. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bluesign](user?id=bluesign) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711761)   | [parent](#23711597) | [prev](#23712315) | [next](#23712835) [–]  I think it would be more clear if you come up with a statement like: ‘we never used this data, other than showing favicons’ | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [epi0Bauqu](user?id=epi0Bauqu) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711771)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711761) | [next](#23712835) [–]  We never used this data, other than showing favicons. In fact, we didn't (and don't in general) collect any user-level data in the first place, per our strict privacy policy: <https://duckduckgo.com/privacy> In this case, the way it works is you hit our favicon service and it returns the favicon, not using any PII in the process, and our web servers are configured not to log any PII. In other words, our system is technically designed and we are legally bound by our privacy policy to not use this data for anything other than showing favicons. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bluesign](user?id=bluesign) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711786)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711771) | [next](#23716874) [–]  Thank you very much for confirmation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [shaper\_pmp](user?id=shaper_pmp) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23716874)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711771) | [prev](#23711786) | [next](#23712835) [–]  You might want to clarify you never *retained* any PII, unless you can 100% confirm that that favicon request didn't include any embedded user- or installation-id in cookies, headers or the like? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ddevault](user?id=ddevault) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712835)   | [parent](#23711597) | [prev](#23711761) | [next](#23712314) [–]  Thank you for re-opening and prioritizing this. However, this problem demonstrates gross incompotence for a browser team supposedly concerned with privacy. Will you please do a post-mortem on how this code made it through your code review process in the first place, as well as how it managed to stay in place for a full year after it was pointed out that it represented a privacy problem? "Sends every URL you visit to the vendor's servers" is the *single worst thing* DuckDuckGo could have done for privacy in this web browser, and that needs to be accounted for. There was a major failure in the code review process, ticket review process, and in how you treat your community. A standard marketroid "by design" response with washy promises that "we'll take very good care of this highly sensitive personal data, just trust us" is not something I want to see in the future from this team.

This is absolutely not an example of gross incompetence. I agree that for a company built around privacy even the appearance of impropriety needs to be avoided. DDG holds themselves to a higher standard and their users hold them to a higher standard. This was a design flaw and a process flaw. DDG prioritized speed and efficiency over privacy (or in this case, perceived privacy) and I suspect there isn’t a soul on HN who hasn’t made that trade off at some point. They assessed the cost/benefit and risk/reward and it turned out their assessment was wrong. Now they’re fixing it. It happens. But to call this gross incompetence is really blowing it completely out of proportion. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ddevault](user?id=ddevault) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712979)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712942) | [next](#23713761) [–]  I'm not blowing it out of proportion. This one specific "design flaw", if we're being generous, has been raised many times with many different browser vendors and add-on vendors as a very bad thing that you cannot do. There is plentiful wisdom on this issue. The first rule of privacy is never handle the private data in the first place. An accidental leak is one thing, but deliberately designing a feature whose side effect is exfiltrating heaps of private data, then doubling down on it *for a year* after it's pointed out to you, then doubling down *again* when it's raised on HN - this *is* gross incompetence. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [akerl\_](user?id=akerl_) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713761)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712835) | [prev](#23712942) | [next](#23716156) [–]  You can’t think of anything they could have done that would be worse than sending URLs to their lookup server? It’s the single worst thing? My browser syncs URL history between my devices, and that’s a feature that I value about it. Your comments on this topic seem to suggest that all users are making the same decisions about what is acceptable usage of their data, and that’s pretty obviously not true. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ddevault](user?id=ddevault) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713960)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23713761) | [next](#23716156) [–]  If your browser is Firefox, then it encrypts your history before sending it to the vendor. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jiofih](user?id=jiofih) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23716156)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712835) | [prev](#23713761) | [next](#23712314) [–]  Maybe you’re taking this a bit too far?

Contrary to this framing, it’s not possible to not incidentally become aware of every single browser users’ usage timing and user IP addresses if the browsers are phoning home this way — a colloquial understanding of ‘collect’, not the James Clapper NSA dodge definition of ‘collect’. Most normals think of collect as become known not as permanently store. You knowing it means others can know it if you break trust or are required to comply with authorities. And regardless of end-to-end encryption, that this user is phoning home to your fave icon endpoint, when, and from what IP, is revealed to every ISP in the chain. You’re leaking browser usage telemetry to every single party to that traffic — the source IP address PII you mention is in unencrypted metadata. The fact this browser connects to that endpoint reveals demographics (choice of privacy browser) and behaviors (when and how much web surfing) to e.g. ISP or nation state firewall operators who are certainly not bound by your ‘just trust us’ privacy policy. Privacy policies are a patch for insufficient privacy engineering. To be a strong privacy browser you could consider what it would take to be “NSL proof” such that if handed a national security letter with gag order, you *cannot* comply. That is not the case with this faveicon telemetry endpoint. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [0xfate](user?id=0xfate) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713796)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23712028) | [next](#23711732) [–]  Just to be fair, as a matter of fact, you surfing that site is revealing you, surfing that site to your ISP and state actors, in the first place.

Maybe this should be an opt-in rather than an opt-out feature?

For example the TabRenderer will fetch the favicons from DDG instead of from the site you are actually visiting: [https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/blob/db728523240e37727...](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/blob/db728523240e377277deb88af71d751eb8bdb5dd/app/src/main/java/com/duckduckgo/app/tabs/ui/TabRendererExtension.kt) Anyway, great decision by Gabriel. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mthoms](user?id=mthoms) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23713260)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711757) | [next](#23711763) [–]  Thanks for pointing out that the service was already in use on their search results pages. To me, this goes a long way toward explaining how this could have happened: Scenario #1 - *"We need to show favicons in our browser tabs. Lets develop an API that requires every domain be sent to us!"* Scenario #2 - *"We need to show favicons in our browser tabs. Hey look, we've already got a service that provides this. We know it collects no PII and our users trust it already."* Obviously the second scenario is flawed thinking, because (of course) it's better to not send that info at all. However, I can easily see how their developer(s) may have arrived at the conclusion that this is still compliant with their privacy ethos. The fact that the favicon service already existed (and was trusted by users) before this was implemented, makes it much easier to understand how this could have been a legitimate mistake and thus, they deserve the benefit of the doubt. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [warpspin](user?id=warpspin) [on July 3, 2020](item?id=23721497)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23713260) | [next](#23711763) [–]  Yes, it is a totally plausible mistake.

On the other hand it is another request to a distinct domain that traverses another path on the Internet, albeit an encrypted one. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [classified](user?id=classified) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711788)   | [root](#23711597) | [parent](#23711732) | [prev](#23711752) | [next](#23708795) [–]  > not as big of an issue as people here make it out to be.

As mentioned in the linked page, the purpose of the request is to retrieve a website's favicon so that it can be displayed in certain places within the app or on the results page. We use an internal favicon service because it can be complicated to locate a favicon for a website. They can be stored in a variety of locations and in a variety of formats. The service understands these edge cases and simplifies retrieval within our apps and our search engine. Like our search results, the favicon service adheres to our strict privacy policy[1] in that the requests are anonymous and we do not collect or share any personal information.

Here's the schema: ```   CREATE TABLE meta(key LONGVARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY, value LONGVARCHAR);   CREATE TABLE icon_mapping(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,page_url LONGVARCHAR NOT NULL,icon_id INTEGER);   CREATE TABLE favicons(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,url LONGVARCHAR NOT NULL,icon_type INTEGER DEFAULT 1);   CREATE TABLE favicon_bitmaps(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,icon_id INTEGER NOT NULL,last_updated INTEGER DEFAULT 0,image_data BLOB,width INTEGER DEFAULT 0,height INTEGER DEFAULT 0,last_requested INTEGER DEFAULT 0);   CREATE INDEX icon_mapping_page_url_idx ON icon_mapping(page_url);   CREATE INDEX icon_mapping_icon_id_idx ON icon_mapping(icon_id);   CREATE INDEX favicons_url ON favicons(url);   CREATE INDEX favicon_bitmaps_icon_id ON favicon_bitmaps(icon_id);  ``` Related source code: [https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/components/...](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/components/history/core/browser/thumbnail_database.cc) I haven't looked at Firefox and Safari but I assume they do something similar. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zzo38computer](user?id=zzo38computer) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711266)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23710457) | [next](#23710925) [–]  I would hope that it can also be made to cache 404 and 410 responses to favicon requests too (or at least 410 even if not 404), so that it won't keep trying to access it. Also, in SQLite, note that LONGVARCHAR is the same as TEXT, and that you don't need to specify both UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY (it is redundant), and that if it is not a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY and not WITHOUT ROWID, then it isn't the real primary key but just an index (same as UNIQUE); add WITHOUT ROWID if you want to make it a real primary key, but note that the way the data is stored differs then, and WITHOUT ROWID is inefficient with tables storing large blobs. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dvdkhlng](user?id=dvdkhlng) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23710925)   | [parent](#23708795) | [prev](#23709315) | [next](#23709100) [–]  In germany we have the words "Datensparsamkeit" (data parsimony) and "Datenvermeidung" (data prevention) [1].

I can't even understand why they try to justify their actions. It's like omitting the seat-belt in a car, then telling customers that this was required to make the in-car entertainment system more usable.

It does not matter that they say they do not collect the information, it is enough it is unnecessarily sent to their servers to make the whole function illegal. The transmission of ip address alone, which is necessary for the TCP request to happen, deanonymizes the request enough to not be considered anonymous within the GDPR framework. GDPR Article 5 (1) c: "Personal data shall be ... adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);" - this is the "Datensparsamkeit" you mentioned. Exceptions from Article 7 do not apply: The user has to give wilfully give informed consent, which he cannot do as the privacy policy of the browser omits the information that all visited domains are transmitted to DDG servers. GDPR Recital 30 "Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags."

They may try to argue that the transmission of visited domain names serves a purpose (browser performance) and that the user agreed to that transmission by accepting the TOS etc. However, I think they may be in trouble as consent for data processing under GDPR needs to be given "freely" [1]: "When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, [..] the performance of a contract[..] is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract." As DDG's favicon-hack is not strictly neccessary for operating the DDG-browser, DDG would need to give users the option to opt-out of the favicon-retrieval, otherwise they may have "forced" the users to consent to the data processing, thereby voiding that consent as far as the GDPR is concerned.

But well, it already breaks down at the "informed" aspect. Their appstore pages link to the generic privacy policy of the company instead of for the browser specifically. This alone will usually already NOT be accepted by the supervisory authorities at least in Germany - the Landesdatenschutzaufsichten usually require a product specific privacy policy being linked for it being valid (personal experience), or at least making clear in the general policy what applies to the product, what not.

When that happens, you have to do insanely stupid seeming stuff like explaining in your privacy policy even, why your application, which is clearly for accessing a webservice, actually needs the Android permission to access the internet at all, true story. So I am pretty sure, an app sending visited domains to a central server outside the EU without even a mention of that fact in the privacy policy will cause problems with them, should they ever check the app. Of course, other countries might handle this differently, as Ireland shows. So whoever thinks my interpretation is overly broad should first have the decency to step forward and actually explain why, instead of hammering a button and second, talk to me again after he had a meeting with the responsible authority and listen to THEIR interpretation of the GDPR ;-) People should not mistake my interpretation with endorsement of the overly broad text of the GDPR itself. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [serverQuestion](user?id=serverQuestion) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711225)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23710989) | [prev](#23711798) | [next](#23709100) [–]  Wait what? a TCP request already breaks the GDPR rules?

IP-adddresses are considered personally identifying information. TCP requests transmit IP addresses. Under the strict interpretation of the GDPR, a lot of things which are common outside the EU might be illegal, like e.g. embedding Google Fonts. To be on the safe side, people usually at least list these external dependencies in their privacy policies to construct some kind of "consent", but till we have more actual court rulings, this is a huge problem area. For the problem at hand, it is pretty clearly illegal, as it's not only an ip address transmitted, it is a combination of ip address plus visited unrelated domain. This allows the creation of profiles. It does not matter for the GDPR, if the profile is ACTUALLY created, the pure possibility of creating it any time is enough to be a problem. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [afiori](user?id=afiori) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711747)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23711262) | [next](#23711288) [–]  I don't think this is an accurate way to analyze GDPR compliance. As the staffer points out this favicon service follows their own privacy policy, if by this policy they keep (or analyze, sell, distribute, etc.) no data on your use of the service then there is nothing of interest for the GDPR. They might have to prove that their privacy policy is indeed GDPR conformant and that their service works as advertised, but in practice this is likely more about public trust that legality. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [warpspin](user?id=warpspin) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711918)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23711747) | [next](#23711288) [–]  It's not as simple as that. Art. 4 GDPR (1) clearly makes the (ip-address, visited domain) tuple personal data Art. 4 GDPR (2) defines "processing" data, and the pure "collecting" of data, even if immediately thrown away, is usually already considered "processing", therefore the GDPR applies. If you are doubting this, just for a moment imagine, instead of the visited domain they would have sent all form data, including for example credit card data, you entered somewhere on a third party webpage to their central server and did not mention the fact in their privacy policy. Do you really think then there is "nothing of interest for the GDPR" just because they do not actually permanently record that information? It would clearly be a violation. But to the GDPR, the importance of that data is equal. In fact, the domainnames might actually be more important to the law, as article 9 establishes event stricter rules for "sensitive" data about e.g. health or sex life of a person, and the domainnames might just leak that information. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dvdkhlng](user?id=dvdkhlng) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711288)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23711225) | [prev](#23711262) | [next](#23709100) [–]  > Wait what? a TCP request already breaks the GDPR rules?

Potentially saving a few requests here and there is certainly not worth phoning home with that kind of data *regardless of what records you keep how much you do to anonymize it*. This is especially true for a company that has built its brand on promises of privacy! Besides, favicon requests are small potatoes compared to the kind of tracking, ads, metrics, and other often-unnecessary page resources that bog down most of the modern web. And a well-designed website can mitigate the issue pretty easily. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [systemvoltage](user?id=systemvoltage) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23709078)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23709032) | [prev](#23709132) | [next](#23709424) [–]  It seems like DDG just doesn't want to do more work to make the browser do the sensible thing and instead piggy back on their existing favicon service, and then going to make the argument that it is safe with us. The domain of browser is totally different from reaching out to the website and rendering favicons server side. Do you not see this as a problem? I think it is acceptable to say "We agree this is a problem, and we are gonna look into fixing this" instead of pushing back on an obvious problem. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [santraginean](user?id=santraginean) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23709424)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23709032) | [prev](#23709078) | [next](#23709417) [–]  Surely you could fetch the favicon asynchronously and update the address bar or tabs or wherever you display it only after the other assets are loaded?

If it's not present, then you have options, and yes, using your weird API is an option (which I still don't like, but ok).

If not could you please clue him in and get some guidance because you are absolutely getting roasted here and are wrecking DDG's carefully built up reputation.

This response is fine. It’s honest feedback, and it isn’t a personal swipe to say it’s above someone’s pay grade to be responding to a PR crisis as an honest engineer. I was once an honest engineer too, publicly. Being honest in private is enough for me now. It’s a lesson worth learning. That said, it’s not like a single HN comment will make or break a company, so if they’re really just a rank-and-file engineer, I hope the company won’t come down on them too hard. A simple “don’t do that” would suffice. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [raxxorrax](user?id=raxxorrax) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711468)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23711114) | [next](#23711008) [–]  Yes, but chastising an employee is not in the interest of good PR, even if we sadly see that quite often in the days of social media. That is especially true if the employee just honestly laid out the facts, I wouldn't even call that a mistake. I use DDG and the possibility of getting a statement directly from an engineer conveys much more trust than a carefully crafted PR statement ever could. I would think again about using it if the company does indeed come down on employees that live the values the company writes on its flags to have honest and transparent business practices. That said, I am careful too when I state things about my company, even if I believe there is nothing to hide. Still, people that think it isn't the place for others with knowledge to comment are often not too impressive and would have difficulties in convincing me that privacy and transparency are real goals instead of just looking decent enough. Furthermore the naming of management of DDG creates a stark contrast to the suggestion for more professional distance. I don't like PR very much as you might have guessed, but like a good design it needs some congruence. If people find out that you just shut up for your company, it might give people the wrong impression about their business. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sillysaurusx](user?id=sillysaurusx) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711543)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23711468) | [next](#23711008) [–]  It’s your duty as an employee to shut up for your company. I didn’t learn this until later in my career. Fortunately it didn’t have lasting impact. By commenting on an ongoing PR crisis without consulting management, you are both undermining their ability to respond in an effective way — imagine how strange it would look to see a “Hey, X from <company> here” after an existing one was already posted — and you’re acting on your own rather than in a team. You’re a part of a team; how could you think it’s a good idea to act alone? Of course, I am talking to my former self with this comment, since that’s exactly what I did at S2 when working on HoN. It was a mistake, and I gave the community the wrong impression about the company’s priorities. You have to understand, when you’re given money to do a job, you’re not given authority to *become* that job. Just because your job is getting beat up on social media doesn’t mean you should just jump in and go “Hey, that’s not true!” It doesn’t matter whether it’s true. Here, let me pretend to be DDG: “Hi, Shawn from DDG here. You’re right; this was an oversight on our part. Obviously we dropped the ball on this. To clarify, we were unintentionally gathering the data as a side effect of our favicon service. <some technical details here>. We’ll be acting immediately to reverse this, and we’ll be enacting policy changes to ensure that user privacy — our core mission — is maintained going forward.” But that’s not what they said. And if you’re gonna tell the community the opposite of what they want to hear, you’d better be in charge of the company’s Telling The Community Things division. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jacquesm](user?id=jacquesm) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711718)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23711543) | [next](#23711008) [–]  Thank you for explaining this all far more eloquently than I ever could.

If what he describes is damaging their reputation to you, that's on the business, not on the commenter. If anything, the commenter seems to have been honest and straightforward with what's going on.

Pointing that out is a service, not a sleight. And yes, if this is not in an official capacity he should either keep quiet or run it by the PR dept. People have lost their jobs for far less.

DDG is precious, saying things that are very much against what I know to be the founding principles of the company is something that should only be done by those that have been given the proper authority. The response here is candid but ultimately not the one that DDG would and should give. Gabriels' contribution upthread pretty much confirms that. My comment was simply to ensure things would not get worse than they already were until someone in a position of authority at DDG could step in. All you have to do is to read this comment thread to see the kind of damage that a single statement by someone affiliated with the company can do. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [im3w1l](user?id=im3w1l) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712370)   | [root](#23708795) | [parent](#23710107) | [prev](#23710987) | [next](#23710165) [–]  For me it does the opposite.

But in this particular case the engineer says things that I know for a fact are not in line with DDG's mission statement so even if he speaks off-message he's actually destroying that trust.

It makes sense on your search engine, but adding it to your web browser is very much over the line. I have read your explanations in good faith and they don't cut it. This behavior cannot continue. Good privacy promises are not based on trust - they're based on not ever handling private data in the first place. If you don't quickly admit your mistake and roll this back, it will jepoardize your entire brand - and rightfully so. If you believe this behavior is okay, then it demonstrates incompetence; if you don't believe this behavior is okay but do it anyway, it demonstrates malice.

I accept DDG's statement that this is about a favicon and that they "do not collect or share any personal information", and despite that, I also agree with others that DDG should be on the safe side and just stop doing this small thing. It's just the safer and more moral thing to do (So DDG, as many are suggesting, plz stop doing it. Today is good). But... the reaction here is "they made a mistake, let's pile on like kids in a playground" ignoring the genuinely huger issue of the amount of info and mining that google et al. do. There's no measure of proportion in the responses, someone is making a mistake then there's a wolfish, pack-like desire to get stuck in and hurt someone. Which is why politicians rarely admit mistakes, because it's taken as a sign of weakness, not strength, to admit you were wrong. DDG isn't the big evil on the web but from reading some of these you'd think it was the 2nd google.

It's an open source project. Maybe you consider them closing the issue on GH to be "hiding it" but I don't. And the plenty of people talking about it in that thread still apparently don't, either. IMHO their response made sense. You're already trusting DDG with your search history which for most people might as well be a list of 99% of the domains they visit. If you trust their privacy policy for that, I don't see the big deal here. I do agree that it should be changed, but only because as is it seems *imperfect* and I seek perfection in most things.

All they would need to do is use {URL}/favicon.ico which most if not sites have.

The whole comment was just me talking from the perspective of a possible self identified victim and how that person (me) would respond in such a case. Forgiveness would've to happen for me to trust that party again, which would be a requirement for me becoming a user/paying for the service again. If that possible other party doesn't care about wherever the people they've supposedly wronged use/pay for their services, then there is obviously no need for any interaction after that point.

Once people have gone down the avenue of earnestly reporting private information leakage, the correct answer is to investigate. DDG decided not to do this and instead dismissed the problem completely out of hand and ignored it for almost a year without taking any action. No one asked for an apology, they asked DDG to admit fault and then to fix the problem. ie "we shouldn't have done that" not "we're sorry we did that."

As a privacy-first company, for them to make any decision that is for performance but adds additional privacy risk shows they make the wrong decisions. They also left this for over a year after being told about it and part of the only reason it was caught was that their browser app is open-source. What about all their closed-source services, like their favicon service their browser apparently relies on. We shouldn't blindly trust any company and a privacy-first company should be willing to assume we don't trust them and therefore it is up to them to prove everything they do. I get a few of the responses on their Github page are now non-helpful, but the big point here is that by DuckDuckGo taking this series of actions (implementing the browser like this, ignoring a valid bug report about it, and only reopening the issue after massive push from users) it shows that DuckDuckGo isn't as privacy-focused as I thought, nor many others. I've been using DuckDuckGo as my sole search provider for several years now, on all my devices, but I'm concerned about what else they may have done in the sake of "performance" over privacy. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [OptionX](user?id=OptionX) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23714593)   | [root](#23711393) | [parent](#23712786) | [prev](#23712850) | [next](#23711785) [–]  "collecting your browser history just to display a stupid favicon is the most ridiculous excuse I've heard in a long while" Though I agree the the implementation could be better, they should just check the head and the root for the icon and if not found that's that. But the possibility of something be used for malicious ends does not entail confirmation of it being used that way. Just because we have knifes in our kitchen does not make us automatically guilty of stabbing people.

What they are and why they matter so much. DDG's backend is not audited and so one wonders if that same lack of understanding applies to the backend as well.

There's no measure of proportion in the responses, someone is making a mistake then there's a wolfish, pack-like desire to get stuck in and hurt someone. Sadly people simply derive satisfaction from piling on like this. The pop psychology explanation is that it's because people are dissatisfied with their own lives and are lashing out at anything that allows them to vent that underlying frustration. It sounds plausible, but it also sounds like it might be an over-generalisation. I think it's certainly fair to say - as depressing as it is - that it may be somewhat in our nature to behave in this way, that most or all of us may possess this characteristic to a greater or lesser extent, and that the current political, cultural, economic, and media climate is only serving to amplify that tendency. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [baud147258](user?id=baud147258) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711685)   | [root](#23711393) | [parent](#23711612) | [next](#23712753) [–]  Also with the current social media platforms, it's really easy to find and participate in such pile up. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Fiveplus](user?id=Fiveplus) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711749)   | [root](#23711393) | [parent](#23711685) | [next](#23712753) [–]  The current social media climate favors disagreement. This is directly in correlation with 'engagement' around which platforms are designed. Call it banking on outrage/hacktivism/quarrelling or simply engaging in peaceful debates. Companies and their algorithms have come to a funny conclusion that this is what increases said engagement (I'm not questioning their business model). User retention is crucial in this era, so is the intention of getting them to check back in ever so often. Thus, dark patterns emerge. Point is, once you get used to 'that' online-aura, you unwillingly carry it with you wherever you go. Human brain does not have buttons to switch between modes.

Most complaining or being heavily critical about DDG are probably already upset to the point of abandonment with other services and they don't want the same trend to happen to this competitor (DDG). This sort of reaction is, IMHO, due to poor diversity of viable competitors. In our societal structure, competitive options are the only things that keep power in check. I'm personally not entirely convinced you can have a reasonable amount of diverse competition in our economic system and there are some inherent equilibria that we tend to converge on over and over again in a market space (without corresponding massive social equalibria shifts). If you do have any sort of faith left in our economic system, then you certainly want competitors like DDG to be different and be successful. Even if you don't have much faith, outside of say stringent regulation, supporting these sort of competitors is really the only practical option we have in the current state of affairs. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [christophilus](user?id=christophilus) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23712123)   | [parent](#23711393) | [prev](#23712753) | [next](#23712013) [–]  > There's no measure of proportion in the responses Man.

If you hosted your own instance then it would be a lot more reliable since the IP wouldn’t send a suspiciously high amount of requests. As for your trust argument, I couldn’t disagree more. You choose to trust DuckDuckGo, who happens to be closed source, because of their branding. The same way people trust/trusted Google/Apple/etc. because of theirs. This thread is a perfect example why being open source is the most important thing for any privacy service (because otherwise this privacy leak likely wouldn’t have been discovered, and people wouldn’t have known that the company so carelessly violate people’s privacy and fail to correct it when people point it out.. it should really make you wonder what’s happening in the search engines codebase). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [leereeves](user?id=leereeves) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23710547)   | [root](#23708385) | [parent](#23710240) | [prev](#23712221) | [next](#23710372) [–]  As a DDG user I don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything.

If it isn't, then you're going to end up with another google. A direct correlation exists between the revenue Google receives for selling data and the quality of its search.

For example the BBC website where DDG interestingly enough just uses /favicon.ico and the other browsers use the apple touch icon. (Information I found from just looking at the pages headers) Don't really understand why they do extra work to get worse results... This feels to me slightly worse than just a privacy concern, it's a misunderstanding of their domain which leads me to the question of what else do they not fully understand. The good news is that you can have the DDG search engine as a default in other browsers. (I understand that the DDG browser is probably not their main focus and any lack of knowledge can potentially be just on their mobile browser.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tananaev](user?id=tananaev) [on July 1, 2020](item?id=23708309)   | [prev](#23710330) | [next](#23708449) [–]  Very weak argument for why they do it.

I often end up with 100+ tabs in firefox before I close them all. I don't think think I'd consider that being a power user, but would a 10x power user simply mean someone with over 1,000 tabs open? I haven't used Chrome regularly in the last year or so, but it would get noticeably slow by the time I had 3-4 windows with 10-20 tabs each. Firefox hasn't really had that issue yet.

For the same reason people are upset about the favicon thing I don't want anything (mis)typed in the urlbar to be sent to a search engine. I've failed to find the correct setting to make this happen a few times before but just looked again and setting keyword.enabled to false prevents it from searching from the url bar (the setting is confusing and not related to the search keywords feature). I did try firefox search keyword anyway once a while ago but it isn't that easy to configure and the setting were lost not too long after I started using it (I don't remember the details but I think my profile was corrupted by ecryptfs and the keywords didn't import to a new profile or something like that). Not importing them isn't a horrible choice (if that is what actually happened) considering there doesn't seem to be an easy way to even list them, but there should at least be a distinct import/export for keywords. The search page of preferences has a keyword field next to search engines but it doesn't seem to actually list them nor can you add a keyword from that page. All in all, it doesn't seem like a feature Mozilla cares about at all, although it would be a nice feature with a bit more work. Use from right click search on text selection would be another thing that would make it much more useful. I tend to use ! in two circumstances, one as others mentioned when a DDG search didn't return what I wanted (and I am fine with letting DDG know that since it is the exact same search I just searched DDG) and secondly when I am looking for something on a particular site. Some of the second case would be best done via Firefox keyword search but the advantage of DDG is that they have a lot of obvious names going to the obvious place so rare specific searches are much more convenient than doing anything to set up a list. Since I very rarely use such searches, there isn't anything DDG could learn about me from avoiding just those searches going to DDG. OTOH, using site searches more frequently would be a win for privacy. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mkl](user?id=mkl) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23711485)   | [parent](#23710581) | [prev](#23710623) | [next](#23709658) [–]  I only use bangs when regular DDG search has failed me, and I'm quite happy to tell DDG of that failure. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hota\_mazi](user?id=hota_mazi) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23709658)   | [prev](#23710581) | [next](#23711637) [–]  > At DuckDuckGo, we do not collect or share personal information.

Parse all meta icon tags, prefer one that matches exact client resolution of current display (don't even have to download the icons - the sizes are defined as part of the meta tag), else use the largest-resolution one, else in desperate bid try site/favicon.ico, otherwise give up. Really shouldn't be complicated enough to need a special service to handle "edge cases". Another comment mentions web manifest - I guess try those first before meta tags, or whatever order the standard says to use.

On a technical level of course its doable but in reality it's a complete waste of data and processing, not to mention it could take a long time to show up. I imagine they have these favicons all cached on their side so they can quickly send the right file down and/or do this processing if needed.

Even if DDG is legitimately not *using* the data they are definitely collecting the data. The problem with that is that it requires users to "trust" DDG, which is not how the world works today. If you are a company that collects info, and you expect users to trust that the info will remain safe, secure, and never get misuse that is downright foolish for anyone to believe a word of that. We all know that DDG cannot claim it's impossible for them to get hacked and have all that data leak out. Hacks happen all the time and so the solution for DDG is to simply NOT collect the data, rather than collect and claim it's all secure. And we all also know DDG has (or will) get a NSL (National Security Letter) from the NSA to secretly turn over the data anyway, and when that does happen the DDG employees are not even allowed to admit it ever happened. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [awinter-py](user?id=awinter-py) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23708944)   | [prev](#23713926) | [next](#23708405) [–]  seems like the ticket author found this by reading code (presumably was grepping for duckduckgo.com URLs) this would *never* happen with a consumer-facing product from apple or google; someone would have to MITM their whole OS to discover phone-home | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LeoNatan25](user?id=LeoNatan25) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23709313)   | [parent](#23708944) | [next](#23708405) [–]  It actually happens very often.

For a browser, yes, a client-side solution is possible and probably preferable. Please check and upvote other comment trees.* This makes sense to me and is not alarming. Getting favicons actually is difficult to do robustly; many applications and websites use Google's service to do so, which then leaks the request to Google: <https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=ycombinator.com> Putting this logic in the client is not feasible. You want to send requests directly to every shady site that shows up in your search results, load their pages in the background, work through network delays and HTTP errors, and parse out the location/format of the favicon files? DuckDuckGo hosting this functionality themselves is also a positive. They have previously been burned when the Web of Trust service they were originally using was found to be farming data, and turned it off immediately once discovered. Processing, hosting, and serving the icon themselves prevents that from happening again. This is not to say that DDG is perfect: links you click do seem to be redirected through a /l/ page on their domain, which can cause problems: <https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/duckduckgo.html> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pwdisswordfish2](user?id=pwdisswordfish2) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23708832)   | [parent](#23708427) | [next](#23708478) [–]  "This is not to say that DDG is perfect: links you click do seem to be redirected through a /l/ page on their domain ..." I am surprised the user is not complaining about this instead of the favicons. Their privacy policy goes on about the privacy implications of Referer headers and instead of calling out browsers for sending Referer by default, they instead give themselves power to record all the user's clicked results themselves. The Referer problem is something that can be solved by the user at the browser level through, e.g., using a client that does not send Referer, browser extensions/plug-ins that can control headers sent, or perhaps with a local proxy to remove the Referer header. Unless DDG has changed, these prefixed result URLs are the default. It is possible to get unprefixed result URLs using the "lite" version of DDG however that is not the default. "Privacy-focused" search engine chooses less private default. News at 11. I recently noticed that DDG has started redirecting queries submitted via POST to /lite/. The redirect is to the same domain. No explanation. I have a custom client that does not follow redirects and I now have to submit two sets of HTTP headers instead of one. These guys are trying to make money from advertising just like everyone else. They have to be very particular in the methods they use to do it -- check the exceptions in their privacy policy -- but it is the same game. Ads and affiliate links. That sort of business and privacy are always going to be at odds with each other. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bscphil](user?id=bscphil) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23709245)   | [root](#23708427) | [parent](#23708832) | [next](#23709012) [–]  This is done only for browsers that don't support setting the referrer policy. <https://caniuse.com/referrer-policy>.

And I have no clue how search results come into this? Of course the browser isn't fetching favicons on search result pages, that's the servers job, but that's not what this is about.

As far as I understand from the title, this is for the pages that you actually visit. For those pages it totally make sense for the browser to figure out favicon locally on its own. As for complexity, I'm sure users of privacy oriented software would prefer to not have favicon in small percentage of corner cases rather than leaking browsing history. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [richdougherty](user?id=richdougherty) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23709046)   | [parent](#23708427) | [prev](#23708571) | [next](#23708484) [–]  > Putting this logic in the client is not feasible. > You want to send requests directly to every shady site that shows up in your search results, load their pages in the background, work through network delays and HTTP errors, and parse out the location/format of the favicon files? Looking at DuckDuckGo search results and visiting a page that you navigate to are two different things. 1. DuckDuckGo search results: DDG already returns the search results so there's no privacy violation to return the favicon or the URL for the favicon in the list. 2. Any page that isn't a DDG search results page: Use client side logic to locate the favicon. This means worse performance but better privacy - which aligns with DDG's goals. If you want to optimise this then DDG could send the client some precalculated Bloom filters with info about known sites. The client could use these to try certain methods of favicon retrieval first. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [stefan\_](user?id=stefan_) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23708484)   | [parent](#23708427) | [prev](#23709046) | [next](#23708710) [–]  I don't need the favicon for a domain I never visited just because it adds some visual cool to your UI.

The EU for example can't wait to slap them with another huge fine. Go here and turn your "web and app activity", your "location history" and "ad personalisation" off, if they aren't already: <https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization> If you do that, there's no evidence that Google is more privacy invading than DuckDuckGo, since you're left with taking their word for it. And frankly I trust a big, bureaucratic company more than I trust a startup. The ideal would be to trust technology (e.g. end to end encryption, open source) but that's not the case here. Note that I also use DuckDuckGo in my Private Mode, as Firefox allows setting different search engine for Private Mode. I do that because it's better to compartmentalize your online personas, plus I keep my "web and app activity" in Google on, with deletion after 3 months. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [stan\_rogers](user?id=stan_rogers) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23708678)   | [parent](#23708354) | [prev](#23710609) | [next](#23708580) [–]  There's always Startpage.

IMO it has an advantage over Startpage because of its integration of vertical search sources, like Stack Overflow [0]. I'm the creator. Mojeek [1] is also a good privacy option that doesn't get talked about as much as DDG. They distinguish themselves by having their own search index.

Let me break this down as simple as I can: 1. End user does a DDG search for "food" 2. The "food" query returns a list of search results, these results have each have a link, DDG wants to display the favicon for each link. 3. To be clear, DDG does not store or log the IP address of the user doing the query. They do, however, know what was queried, so they know "somebody" somewhere searched for "food". They have to know this, they are a search engine after all. 4. Since DDG wants to show the favicon "privately", and they dont want to put that logic/work on the client side (which could leak your IP), so instead DDG finds the favicon internally. 5. A DDG server, completely separate from anything search-related is then tasked with finding the favicon for your "food" query results, lets say the #1 result is www.allrecipes.com, so a DDG server goes to www.allrecipes.com and finds the exact favicon location. 6. The "found" favicons are then stored in a cache, and displayed from the cache like this: [https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/ip3/www.allrecipes.c...](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/ip3/www.allrecipes.com.ico) (and if no favicon is found in the local cache, you get a grey arrow by default) 7. I'd like to note, even with all this action, DDG doesn't know if you actually "visited" www.allrecipes.com, they simply know that some anonymous user did a search for "food", www.allrecipes.com was a search result, and a favicon was displayed. They dont know who searched for it because the users IP is not stored anywhere, they dont know if you visited www.allrecipes.com, they prevented you from leaking your IP to allrecipes.com since they didn't force the end user to load the favicon. So whats the issue? What am I missing here? PS: You know this works because after doing all these searches for food and seeing allrecipes.com (and even clicking allrecipes.com result in the DDG Mobile App or browser extension), guess what? allrecipes.com doesn't follow you around with re-targeting ads! Why? Because DDG prevented that from happening! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ddevault](user?id=ddevault) [on July 2, 2020](item?id=23709141)   | [parent](#23709128) | [next](#23709591) [–]  This is not duckduckgo.com.

| Hi [@Tritonio](https://github.com/Tritonio) and thanks for your feedback. The purpose of the request you observed is to retrieve a website's favicon so that it can be displayed in certain places within the app or on the results page. We use an internal favicon service because it can be complicated to locate a favicon for a website. They can be stored in a variety of locations and in a variety of formats. The service understands these edge cases and simplifies retrieval within our apps and our search engine.  At DuckDuckGo, we do not collect or share personal information. That's our privacy policy in a nutshell. For more detailed information on that, you can checkout our privacy policy at <https://DuckDuckGo.com/privacy>. The favicon service, as with all our services, adheres to this privacy policy in that the requests are anonymous and do not collect or share any personal information.  If you have further questions, please let me know. |

| Hi [@tagawa](https://github.com/tagawa), i do trust DDG not using the data in a bad manner, but still i don't get your decision. The best privacy products are made from companies you don't need to trust using your data in a good way, because they collect no data. So for a privacy product it is really hard for me to understand why you chose a minimal performance increase (?) over a critical privacy issue (in my opinion). I think with this decision you are risking a major privacy distrust. |

| I understand that there are different favicon standards and that in some cases it can be difficult to locate it. I believe that those are edge cases though and for a vast majority of websites a simple host/favicon.ico should work. My suggestion for an increased privacy here is:   1. Attempt to load favicon directly from website by simply appending /favicon.ico to hostname (should be the most easy and most common case anyway) 2. In case of no success fallback to use omniscient ddg favicon endpoint |

| Just to understand: Why can't the same algorithm, which is being used in the DDG endpoint, be utilized in the app? If I understand correctly the only reasons are slightly increase performance, reduced network traffic and easier implementation. Is that correct? |

| Hi there! If DDG reviews this, please use the header data on my web pages to determine what the favicon is. I do not have a default favicon for my site. My DeskThemePacks use PNGs for favicons based on the currently viewed theme's normal cursor.  By looking for favicon.ico where it doesn't exist, it affects both my site's performance and SEO. |

| So essentially, the trade-off is between performance and auditability of privacy. I predict that the user segment DDG appeals to will overwhelmingly prefer the latter.  Yes, we already trust DDG, but only because we have to trust someone and others have proved to be untrustworthy. The issue isn't about whether the user trusts DDG, it's about minimizing the need for trust and maximizing the ability to verify privacy. Please consider reopening this issue. |

| I believe reopening and rectifying this design choice would go a long way to preserving the trust that DDG has worked hard to earn in the privacy-oriented community. Even if users trust that DDG is not using this data in any undesirable way, it would provide more peace of mind to users that the data not be sent in the first place.  I am strongly in favor of changing this functionality to no longer leak visited domains. |

| A long time DDG user and advocate here.  First and foremost, thank you for building the most awesome search engine there is right now! 🙂  I must say that I am pretty appalled by this implementation. Yes, I trust DDG with my search data since I have to do searches and DDG always seemed like they actually care about privacy. But at the same time, a privacy aware browser should **never** send close to all the user activity to it's server, even if it is "only" the domains that are browsed. I think most DDG users could live with a slightly less then optimal display of favicons in order to gain the assurance, that their domain history is indeed private to their device. That latter is literally the main reason, why most people install your browser in the first place.  I don't think this should be a discussion about "privacy policies". You are integrating a piece of code and infrastructure in your product, that has the capabilities to spy on people. It just shouldn't be there in the first place.  You should not keep this issue just closed like this, this is a serious matter and it is obvious from the community reactions that this needs to be discussed.

| I don't know why all the fuss... You all know that if you are using his app, you already "trust" that his search service is respecting your privacy, right? C'mon, they are being transparent, as usual.   1. This is not only about the search service. 2. Trust is only a last resort, after they did everything reasonably possible to avoid acquiring unnecessary data in the first place (which they apparently don't).   There are plenty of good browsers on the market. This browser had once privacy as a main selling point, but as it looks, not any more. |

| [@tagawa](https://github.com/tagawa) : Trust is a very brittle thing. It grows slowly and takes years to built it. And only one line of code can shatter it. But instead to react professionally and contritely you made it worse to stamp on the shards to make sure no useful piece of trust will survive. You had one job! :-( |

| For those that don't really understand what is happening:  It is really about that code snippet from [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/blob/ed91c9e551d2a9e1559199f110bd94c076784c71/app/src/main/java/com/duckduckgo/app/global/UriExtension.kt#L60):  ``` private const val faviconBaseUrlFormat = "https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/%s.ico"  fun Uri?.faviconLocation(): Uri? {     val host = this?.host     if (host.isNullOrBlank()) return null     return Uri.parse(String.format(faviconBaseUrlFormat, host)) } ```  The function for retrieving the Favicon is asking for the current host the user is on (e.g. apple.com) and sends it to a service hosted by duckduckgo.com that is saved in the const `faviconBaseUrlFormat`. `%s` is replaced with the actual host the user is on and is send to the duckduckgo.com servers. As an example (change it yourself to whatever host you want):  <https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/apple.com.ico>    I guess they have a cache for already visited hosts etc.  This sends every host the user visits (or the Favicon is requested for) to the duckduckgo.com server. I think it does not really matter what you do or do not do with the data. Its not about trust – its about the minimum you need to trust and this is clearly breaking a lot of peoples perception of what the browser should achieve. As it currently stands, i would consider this even worse of what i imagine googles chrome would do to its users. To make it clear, i don't know exactly what google chrome is doing – its the perception of what i think certain vendors are doing, and i would not expect this from a "privacy first" browser from duckduckgo.com  Tired of being tracked online? We can help.  Please help! |

| 99% of the websites I have seen have either   1. a `<link rel="shortcut icon">`, which directly points to the favicon 2. if not, a `/favicon.ico`   I really don't see the point of this URL anyhow. It's useful for search results (because you'd have to download every page to parse its favicon otherwise, and your search results are already served directly from DDG so there'd be no point), but using it in tabs is not the right way. I'm willing to say this is just laziness rather than malice, though: rather than writing code to figure out the favicon from the page, they just used whatever they normally used on the search results page.  NOTE: DDG results page uses `external-content.duckduckgo.com` instead of `proxy.duckduckgo.com`, and  ``` ~$ host proxy.duckduckgo.com proxy.duckduckgo.com is an alias for external-content.duckduckgo.com. ~$ host icons.duckduckgo.com icons.duckduckgo.com is an alias for external-content.duckduckgo.com.  ```  They also seem to be caching the most common favicons like [#527 (comment)](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues/527#issuecomment-652882558) mentioned. i.e. visit ["apple" on DDG](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=apple) and the top link has its favicon set as `https://duckduckgo.com/assets/icons/favicons/apple.png`.  Please reopen and fix. |

| why not just reuse this purpose-built proxy they already had lying around. Makes perfect sense.  At best this just shows how high a bar DDG has managed to set for itself that its users are holding it to.  Not leaking **every single domain** a user visits is not a high bar. It's the bar you need to pass not to be considered spyware. FFS why are you people trying to defend an idiotic code decision? They are fixing it, great, I'm really happy for that. That doesn't mean we should trivialize the matter.  is already leaps and bounds ahead of the competition in  Leaking the domains to a server puts you leaps **behind** your competition and even your non competition since even regular browsers that don't focus on privacy end up being more private than you.  DYOR but this is why I think these bugs are very serious:  40.114.178.124 is the IP that icons.duckduckgo.com resolves to and WHOIS says that it's managed by Microsoft. If this is Azure, which I would take a bet it is, then that means that for the last year or more, Microsoft could, **technically** tap into that server's memory to see who requested which domain and when. So not only do you need to trust DDG, you also need to trust Microsoft that they didn't do anything bad with the info. Does anyone still remember PRISM? This kind of passive access to user data is exactly what PRISM was about. Although I could be wrong and maybe the actual server is running in DDG's premises and Microsoft is simply acting as a reverse proxy. |

| Hi all, CTO of DuckDuckGo here. I thought it might be helpful if I briefly shared some of our internal thinking around this issue so folks can see how we got here and how we plan to move forward.  The logic behind how we’ve been displaying favicons in our apps is a function of how we operate our private search engine. Since we already have an anonymous favicon service through our search engine, using it has a number of benefits: it avoids more requests to known non-anonymous websites that are visited, it's way faster since it runs server side, saves user bandwidth, and the only externally visible attribute is that the app is connecting to DuckDuckGo.com (as the favicon location is actually encrypted in the path in transit). To our team, utilizing this anonymous service we had made for the search engine seemed like an optimal principled choice across a set of criteria.  We want to be clear that at no point was the actual visited domain otherwise exposed. This favicon service is fully anonymous on our end, and URL parameters (like the favicon domain) are encrypted in transit, just like the search engine (with search queries). This is also why when this issue was raised in the past, we decided to keep the solution as is. At no point was this ignored.  However, we understand that there is an alternative method of getting the favicons locally that a lot of folks prefer while still maintaining our privacy standards. We also believe that method is in line with our product vision of "Privacy, simplified.", considering its a somewhat simpler method than the one we had been using.  So, we went ahead today and implemented the change for both Android ([#878](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/pull/878)) and iOS ([duckduckgo/iOS#667](https://github.com/duckduckgo/iOS/pull/667)) that will move this logic onto the client, and we will no longer be using the favicon service in our apps. These changes are currently in the release phase and are rolling out live now.  We really appreciate the feedback and exchange of ideas on this topic, and on ways to further improve the privacy of our products in general. |

| There's about seven red herrings in this huge thread. A lot of people who suddenly use DDG when it's convenient to complain about it. Right. [@Tritonio](https://github.com/Tritonio) was the only one whom I saw explain the actual vulnerability here (provided you have a positive bias of trust for DDG, which disclaimer, I do):  40.114.178.124 is the IP that icons.duckduckgo.com resolves to and WHOIS says that it's managed by Microsoft. If this is Azure, which I would take a bet it is, then that means that for the last year or more, Microsoft could, technically tap into that server's memory to see who requested which domain and when. So not only do you need to trust DDG, you also need to trust Microsoft that they didn't do anything bad with the info. Does anyone still remember PRISM? This kind of passive access to user data is exactly what PRISM was about. Although I could be wrong and maybe the actual server is running in DDG's premises and Microsoft is simply acting as a reverse proxy.  Ah, SIGINT. Spooky [SIGINT](https://i.imgur.com/QiKcsCK.jpg).  This quote points at Microsoft Azure's IP for example's sake, but that doesn't account for the countless ISPs your data travels through, even on a basic DNS level without vendor participation. A nefarious agency *could* MITM and use this as spyware for a correlation++ attack specifically targeting DDG users. That should terrify all of us because we love privacy, (right?) and when the right adversary arrives – "could" is usually a synonym for "will inevitably".  I fully 100% believe it's innocent, I even feel it makes perfect sense in the mind of a rushed developer. I am happy to see it fixed. Now, with that said, I'd like to propose a solution so the product marketing people can be happy too.  If you want to have this feature locally, make it secure and do the same thing – just bundle a massive SVG sprite sheet with the client (realistically, how big would it be?) and do some sort of table association to pull them up on demand if the hostname has a match. Otherwise, don't make an outbound network request, just return and wait! If you wanted to change the way you do it (and follow more-or-less standard practice), you can rely on site-provided webContent `<head>` data as others have mentioned.  Anyway, I'll pass the mic off now. I think [@nilnilnil](https://github.com/nilnilnil) and DDG exec team did a great job of fixing the issue. Up and onwards! |

An interesting thought would be, if the user has JavaScript enabled, why couldn't DuckDuckGo cook up a URL that looks a little more like this:  <https://duckduckgo.com/l/#/kh=-1&uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGhost_(Swedish_band)>  See that tiny change? That little hash prevents the URL from being sent to the server! I wonder how that would work with referers, too. Of course, parsing that hash would need a little bit of JavaScript, but if the user has it enabled, then...  Maybe there's a technical reason why they use this redirection service, instead of `noreferrer`? Perhaps backwards-compatibility?  EDIT: [Looks like I was right.](https://caniuse.com/#search=noreferrer)   ---   EDIT: Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if they used POST instead of GET, but I'm told Chrome doesn't play nicely with that. |

| [@resynth1943](https://github.com/resynth1943) You're right, the redirect is for backwards-compatibility reasons (there's more about it on [this help page](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/rduckduckgocom/)) but it can be disabled [in the search settings](https://duckduckgo.com/settings#privacy), in which case just the `referrer` meta tag is used. That's set to `origin` by the way.  Re. POST and GET, that can also be toggled [in the same settings page](https://duckduckgo.com/settings#privacy) with GET as the default. |

| I am absolutely AMAZED on how people OVERREACTED about this. First disclaimer: I have NO connection to DDG, I am just a user. I work as sysadmin and web developer full time since 2004.  I do agree this is a "feature" that could be implemented locally to let the users feel more comfortable with his privacy concerns.  But this, **for me**, doesn't represent an anti-privacy practice, as a lot of people are complaining. DDG is basically a search engine. In my own phone I have DDG AND Firefox focus, and use the last as my default browser. Either way, again, I think is a good choice to make the requested change to the local implementation.  What really irritates me is the tone some people come here, complaining in a way that is practically accusing DDG being the same as google & Co. Folks, the distance is HUGE, and i think behind all this there is a key point: it's not about if DDG is receiving your data or not (because, hey, they are a search engine, you know, if you don't input anything, the can't search anything for you). The key point here is what they DO with your data. And they ALWAYS were very clear about that. They anonymize it and process it, to have some valuable info that they could use to improve their products. The "favicon incident" from the users perspective, is just an example of another anonymized service for DDG.  And then you have people coming here saying things like this:  * best privacy products are made from companies you don't need to trust using your data in a good way, because they collect no data * Doesn’t seem to care much about user privacy concerns * How it can be private and secure if you hire security experts who allow it to happen since 2019? * There are plenty of good browsers on the market. This browser had once privacy as a main selling point, but as it looks, not any more. * Meanwhile DDG literally collecting personal information from my device * As it currently stands, i would consider this even worse of what i imagine googles chrome would do to its users. * But closing the issue just like that is a statement. A huge statement. "We dont care about your privacy" * I've just de-installed the Duckduckgo app and also won't be using their search engine anymore. Trust ist lost. Their CEO can put his statement where the sun doesn't shine. * And, sorry, but you cannot argue that a company that cares about privacy seriously adds an online service that tracks (and can collect) user's behavior only "by accident".  All this people, use android? or they have hacked their phones and installed librem? could they all do a better job competing against google? the error was there and it needed to be fixed, it required doing some pressure as his user base, i get it... but this? "the internet" is full of people very very very bored, and always ready to point out the mistakes of others, as if they did everything right... but they cant even just point an issue in an open, free and transparent service (there are not many out there...), manage his own anger, fears and frustration and being polite to keep asking for it.  To ALL DDG staff, thank you for being there, thank you for giving us an alternative to G, thank you for listening, thank you for being open and transparent and thank you for being condescendent even with those that dont deserve it (because you know there are many that do). (PS: english is not my first language, I hope you understand ) |

| [@scabros](https://github.com/scabros) that's fair enough, dude, and I agree with that. People were rude, malicious and forming egregious remarks about the company that just made a mistake.  I can see people have already down voted your post. I've got 31 down votes on a rational opinion, so good luck communicating with the children here.  DuckDuckGo really isn't the second Google.  Far from it.  And that's why I use it. |

| First of all - I am a big fan of DDG   * I promote it whenever I can * I use it anywhere possible * This comment is meant to help the DDG team to understand this PR issue. Even tough - *we* *(OS\_Community)* are very concerned that this explanation is necessary in the first place! *We* normally do not rise up from our cellars - because *we* code. But now where the realms of management and C0D3 collide again, and the management does not show any signs of understanding - *we* have to take action.   This is why I will now explain, (again) what the problem with your answer is and what it indicates.  Hi all, CTO of DuckDuckGo here. I thought it might be helpful if I briefly shared some of our internal thinking around this issue so folks can see how we got here and how we plan to move forward.  Your 'internal thinking' is what has raised this issue in public! It is basically the bare reason for our concerns! Because it shows, that you do not even understand our privacy argument! It is not about the bug, it is your action and the, like [@calimeroteknik](https://github.com/calimeroteknik) puts it, "curios wording", that makes it appear, like you have not understood our critic at all.  Time of Events   1. [@Tritonio](https://github.com/Tritonio) found a curios line of code that sends unnecessary requests to one of your backends 2. [@tagawa](https://github.com/tagawa) said: "The purpose of the request you observed is to retrieve a website's favicon so that it can be displayed in certain places within the app or on the results page"    <https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/pull/878/files#diff-63ac5c0d645555fe179e72977d9c1728> 3. Then [@stefan01](https://github.com/stefan01) and later *we* said, please stop this! There is no reason to send data in the first place! A big part of privacy focused software is, to avoid to creating unnecessary data in the first place. It is not necessary! Please do not send our browser history or any unnecessary request, to any server! No matter how "secure" this server is. Please load the favicon locally, we love you and we do not like heartbreaks!    In the worst case - security is only a illusion - only the hacker with root access knows, what is really going on and maybe like [@Tritonio](https://github.com/Tritonio) indicates Microsoft. 4. DGG show no real understanding and argues in a "curios way" - and now you [@nilnilnil](https://github.com/nilnilnil) continue   Bugs can happen! Bad decisions can happen! But arguing with "trust us, it anonymous", it "saves user badwidth", and its "the only visible attribute", on top of that "we already have a anonymous [...] service"! It is pure poison for trust, because it indicates, you entirely missed the point! Either on purpose or not. Both would be alarming!  The logic behind how we’ve been displaying favicons in our apps is a function of how we operate our private search engine. Since we already have an anonymous favicon service through our search engine, using it has a number of benefits: it avoids more requests to known non-anonymous websites that are visited, it's way faster since it runs server side, saves user bandwidth, and the only externally visible attribute is that the app is connecting to DuckDuckGo.com (as the favicon location is actually encrypted in the path in transit). To our team, utilizing this anonymous service we had made for the search engine seemed like an optimal principled choice across a set of criteria.  Its not that we do not understand your reasoning or the reasoning of [@tagawa](https://github.com/tagawa). The problem is your reasoning, seems to entirely miss our point!  Now you continue - as CTO! This indicates no real insight at all!  We want to be clear that at no point was the actual visited domain otherwise exposed. This favicon service is fully anonymous on our end, and URL parameters (like the favicon domain) are encrypted in transit, just like the search engine (with search queries). This is also why when this issue was raised in the past, we decided to keep the solution as is. At no point was this ignored.  We said, please do not mix the search engine code and your browser code! They should not relate on each other if not necessary (for example if the user actually wants to do a search on DDG). Arguing "we already have a anonymous [...] service" is very hard to understand from a technical point of view. It might make sense for a CFO, but not for nerds or hackers!  However, we understand that there is an alternative method of getting the favicons locally that a lot of folks prefer while still maintaining our privacy standards. We also believe that method is in line with our product vision of "Privacy, simplified.", considering its a somewhat simpler method than the one we had been using.  Like [@calimeroteknik](https://github.com/calimeroteknik) already said: Luckily higher security standards meet your standard! -\_-  So, we went ahead today and implemented the change for both Android ([#878](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/pull/878)) and iOS ([duckduckgo/iOS#667](https://github.com/duckduckgo/iOS/pull/667)) that will move this logic onto the client, and we will no longer be using the favicon service in our apps. These changes are currently in the release phase and are rolling out live now.  You only took this action after enormous public pressure, there was no sign of insight or internal intention to resolve this! This is why you have been compared with BigCorp, because they act like this. (Or like pointed out by some people, are even doing a better job than you, handling these kinds of issues)  [LARP MODE ON] [Loading Game Data...] You currently have (3) quests! [(1) Closed Quest] Even under enormous public pressure, do not remove the criticized code, before at least one year has past! [(1) Open Quest] Understand the whole point, and communicate it in a acceptable way. [(1) Bonus Quest] Build trust back by transparent actions in the future, which reflect that you understood what we said [LARP MODE OFF]  We really appreciate the feedback and exchange of ideas on this topic, and on ways to further improve the privacy of our products in general.  You are welcome! I hope this helps! |

| We really appreciate the feedback and exchange of ideas on this topic, and on ways to further improve the privacy of our products in general.  I overlooked the implications of this. It's much more interesting than it seems. Consequence 1: It means that DDG has started a game of  the privacy defects we introduce and you don't notice, we can keep  …with the general public. The dynamics of this game can be summed up to "we keep hiding things around, and you keep looking for them".  That's immoral, but I believe it's legal and therefore legally allowed to do this. (after all, DDG users are not paying customers) Additionally, it's a private company: a subpoena can compel it to lie to the public and to its customers. Consequence 2: The current evidence unambiguously proves that DDG is commiting at least one of:   * incompetence concerning basic privacy notions ; * basic malevolence, motivated by financial profit and potentially by government pressure.   A real plight, if you want to get away with only PR!  I think that, in order of preference for the public, your options are: 1st. Admit DDG was not respecting privacy in places where it could have, and that the team attempted to not admit it; 2nd. Keep silent, and not do that sort of thing again, so you don't get busted for such practices in the future; 3rd. What you've been doing: say "hey, it's not THAT bad"⁽¹⁾ and "we appreciate the feedback"⁽²⁾.  (1) This is a pretty effective psychological strategy, because it induces self-disgust in people who are not trained to fight it internally. Studying WW2 propaganda helps with understanding that one. (2) Following it with such benevolent-looking words, like this, is pretty efficient at maximizing your chances at people getting tired of arguing. Unfortunately, that can backfire, which is happening right here.  My sharp words should not hide my encouragements towards duckduckgo fighting its innate corporate nature. I never took the time to write such a reply to Google, for instance, because I think it's a lost cause whereas DDG isn't, yet. |

| This is why you have been compared with BigCorp, because they act like this. (Or like pointed out by some people, are even doing a better job than you, handling these kinds of issues)  FWIW Google has a service used in their Chromium browser (and also used by Firefox and others) for clients to find out whether a given host is malicious (e.g. a known phishing page). [Their API](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4) can be used in a way in which hostnames are not sent to Google, and even Google Chrome does things that way. (Then again, there might be other features in Chromium sending hostnames to Google, such as the omnibox autocompletion) |

| Who's trolling?  Everyone who keeps posting here, DDG already received a PR and merged at the codebase [#878](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/pull/878)  Is non-sense to keep posting "furious" and "frustrated" comments here. Again, if people dislike DDG Android app in any sense, don't use it, or just fork it.  The whole idea of OpenSource isn't treating developers as slaves who fulfill all demands of everyone, or to make threats at reddit or any other websites (posted bit above) full of conspiracy stuff and making claims of things they aren't true. This kind of behaviors of developers being kind of slaves from users must STOP. |

Admitting it was a mistake would be a start as far as this discussion goes, and that hasn't happened as far as I can tell.  I do understand your concern, but please look the "issue" and "official response". Everything else happened after the ticket was closed, basically someone said: "Hey look this code you are leaking all url from users!", and they said "ehhm, no".  A good way to report "a software issue" (because the original claim IS a "code" claim), would be creating a PR proposing a replacement of the DDG favicon server. Companies do opensource not only to expose their code to others, but for community to contribute bugs with change proposals. Reporting a bug doesn't solve anything, proposing solutions does.  And following this, a claim related to "privacy concerns" and not "a code issue" happened at issue [#877](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues/877), which the reported posted a change request at Asana platform, and they accepted it. |

| I love how GitHub seems to be removing any and all functions that users can use to report abuse. Especially when it's a whole page of spam about video games (?) that's irrelevant to the project.  Nevertheless, I hope DuckDuckGo can learn from the more fruitful responses, one of which has been authored by [@calimeroteknik](https://github.com/calimeroteknik). I think DuckDuckGo's official response was quite... flattering to themselves, and their project. I'll seek to be more wary of products such as this in the future. |
