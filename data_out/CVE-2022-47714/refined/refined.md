The content relates to CVE-2022-47714.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Last Yard 22.09.8-1 application does not enforce HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers within its HTTP traffic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing HSTS header enforcement.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to intercept and manipulate traffic between the user and the server, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activities. Lack of HSTS allows downgrade attacks to occur, where the secure HTTPS connection is downgraded to insecure HTTP.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks like MitM attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server (e.g. on a shared network).
