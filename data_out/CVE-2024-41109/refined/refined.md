Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint in pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle was accessible to any logged-in Pimcore user, and it disclosed sensitive system and database information. This was due to missing proper authorization checks before returning the statistics data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint exposed detailed information about the Pimcore installation, including:
    - Pimcore version, major version, hash, and platform version.
    - PHP version.
    - MySQL/MariaDB version.
    - List of all installed bundles.
    - List of all database tables and their row counts.
- **Missing Authorization:** The vulnerability existed because the endpoint did not adequately check user permissions before disclosing the sensitive information. The initial check only prevented XmlHttpRequests, but not direct browser access by logged-in users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who has valid Pimcore user credentials (even with low privileges) can gain access to the detailed system and database information, which can potentially aid in further attacks.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** The disclosed information can reveal potential vulnerabilities in the environment, increasing the attack surface for malicious actors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
- **Direct HTTP Request:** A logged-in Pimcore user can navigate directly to the `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint using a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Pimcore User Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the Pimcore system. Low privilege user accounts are sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions <=1.5.1 of `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` and also in `pimcore/ee-admin-ui-classic-bundle` with the versions mentioned above.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.5.2 (and corresponding versions of ee-admin-ui-classic-bundle)
- The fix implemented an authorization check to ensure that only admin users or users with specific permission can access the `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint.

This is a clear information disclosure vulnerability due to missing authorization checks, allowing logged in users to access sensitive system information.
