Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for Pimcore. Navigating to `/admin/index/statistics` with a logged in Pimcore user exposes information about the Pimcore installation, PHP version, MYSQL version, installed bundles and all database tables and their row count in the system.  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.2, 1.4.6, and 1.3.10.
