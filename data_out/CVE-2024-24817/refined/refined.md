Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control when retrieving event invitees within the Discourse Calendar plugin. Specifically, the `/discourse-post-event/events/:post_id/invitees.json` endpoint failed to check if the user was authorized to view the post associated with the event, allowing unauthorized users to access invitee lists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the insufficient access control on the endpoint responsible for retrieving event invitees. It did not verify if the user making the request had the necessary permissions to view the associated post, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed disclosure of sensitive information by exposing invitee lists for events within private categories and private messages (PMs) to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could potentially obtain a list of invitees to events hosted within private categories or PMs, which are designed to restrict access to specific users. This could lead to unwanted disclosure of who is participating in private conversations or events.
- **Privacy Violation:** The vulnerability exposes the identities of users who have been invited to private events, potentially leading to a violation of their privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network by sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege:** Attackers only need to be a low-privileged user (i.e., logged in user or, in some cases, an anonymous user). They do not require specific administrative or elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content indicates that the vulnerability affects versions of the `discourse-calendar` plugin up to and including 0.3. The patched version is 0.4 and above.
- The fix involved adding a `guardian.ensure_can_see!(event.post)` check to ensure that the user is authorized to see the post associated with the event before revealing the invitee list.
- A workaround was mentioned: putting the site behind `login_required` will disallow this endpoint to be used by anonymous users, but logged-in users could still exploit this.
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Moderate) with the following vector:  `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`

This information is consistent with a typical information disclosure vulnerability due to insufficient access controls.
