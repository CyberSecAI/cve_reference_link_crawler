# User can see invitees in events created in PMs and private categories

Moderate

[nattsw](/nattsw)
published
GHSA-wwq5-g5cp-c69f
Feb 22, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 0.3

## Patched versions

>= 0.4

## Description

### Impact

Event invitees created in topics in private categories or PMs (private messages) can be retrieved by anyone, even if they're not logged in.

### Patches

This problem is resolved in the latest version of the discourse-calendar plugin

### Workarounds

No real workaround.

Putting the site behind `login_required` will disallow this endpoint to be used by anonymous users, but logged in users can still get the list of invitees in the private topics.

### Severity

Moderate

4.3

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-24817
