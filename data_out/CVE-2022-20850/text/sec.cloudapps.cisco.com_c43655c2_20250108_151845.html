"text": "A vulnerability in the CLI of stand-alone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software and Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to delete arbitrary files from the file system of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary file path information when using commands in the CLI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the file system of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"
