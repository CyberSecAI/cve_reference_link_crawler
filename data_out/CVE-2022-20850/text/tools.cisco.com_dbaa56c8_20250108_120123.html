This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary file path information when using commands in the CLI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the file system of the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
