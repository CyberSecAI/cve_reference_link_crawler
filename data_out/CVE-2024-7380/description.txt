The Geo Controller plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized menu creation/deletion due to missing capability checks on the ajax__geolocate_menu and ajax__geolocate_remove_menu functions in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create or delete WordPress menus.
