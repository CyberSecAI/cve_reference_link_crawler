Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of default credentials in Philips Vue PACS. The software does not enforce the creation of unique and complex passwords during installation, leaving systems vulnerable if the default password is known or leaked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials**: The system uses a default password that is not changed during initial setup or installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers can gain access to the database by using the default password.
- **Data Integrity**: Successful exploitation can compromise data integrity.
- **System Availability**: Exploitation may impact system availability leading to disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers who have access to the hospital's private network can leverage the default credentials to access the system.
-  The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same private network as the vulnerable Philips Vue PACS system.
- **Privileged Access:** While initial access is through default credentials, the attacker essentially gains high-level access to the database upon exploitation.

**Additional Notes**
- The CISA advisory mentions that a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.8 and CVSS v4 base score of 5.7 have been calculated for the vulnerability.
- Philips recommends that customers can request that Philips update database password(s).
- The advisory also mentions that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
- The CISA advisory indicates that Philips initially reported this vulnerability, but after further analysis determined it had no security impact.
