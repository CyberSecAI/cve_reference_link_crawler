{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the xHCI component, which can lead to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access within a virtualized guest OS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability."
