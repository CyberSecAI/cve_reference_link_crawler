{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from KernelSU's incorrect implementation of APK signature verification. Specifically, KernelSU was obtaining the signature from the last block with ID 0x7109871a, whereas Android's installation process obtains the signature from the first such block. This discrepancy allows a specially crafted malware with a manipulated app signing block to bypass signature verification and gain root privileges. Additionally, KernelSU doesn't properly handle signature downgrading, which further weakens the verification process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect signature block retrieval: KernelSU retrieves the signature from the last block instead of the first.",
    "Missing signature downgrade check: KernelSU fails to check and handle cases where the signature is downgraded from V3 to V1, which would cause signature not found error during Android installation verification, but not by KernelSU, leading it to use the V1 signature rather than V2 or V3.",
    "Bypass of APK signature verification: The combination of the above vulnerabilities allows malicious APKs with manipulated signatures to be installed without being flagged by KernelSU, leading to privilege escalation.",
    "Vulnerable to V2 signature downgrade attacks: Due to the conditions for signature not found error check not implemented by KernelSU, the tool treats a V1 signature as V2, opening it up to signature downgrade attacks."

  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a malicious application to gain root privileges on the affected device. This could enable an attacker to perform a wide range of actions, including data theft, installation of additional malware, and complete device control.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves the installation of a specially crafted malicious APK on a device with a vulnerable version of KernelSU. The malicious APK is designed to exploit the signature verification flaw to bypass security checks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to install a malicious APK on a KernelSU-enabled device. This implies that the attacker may need some degree of social engineering to convince the user to install the malicious application or to hide it through other means on the user device."
