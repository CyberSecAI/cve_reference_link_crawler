Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper HTML entity encoding of user-supplied data before being inserted into HTML input fields. Specifically, the variables `$nama_supplier`, `$alamat_supplier`, and `$notelp_supplier` are directly embedded within the `value` attributes of `<input>` tags in `/ci_wms/application/views/admin/content/website/supplier.php` without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This occurs because unsanitized user input is directly inserted into the HTML code of the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable input fields. When a user loads the page containing these malicious inputs, the JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information on the page or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacement: Altering the appearance or functionality of the website.
    - Malicious redirection: Redirecting users to phishing pages or other malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/ci_wms/website/supplier/edit/{id}` endpoint. By including malicious JavaScript code in the `nama_supplier`, `alamat_supplier`, or `notelp_supplier` parameters, the attacker can inject the payload into the database.
- Subsequently, when an administrator or other user views the supplier edit page, the injected script will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the `/ci_wms/website/supplier/edit/{id}` endpoint. This would typically require a valid session and the ability to modify supplier information.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable input parameters, and the target page `/ci_wms/application/views/admin/content/website/supplier.php`

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```html
  <input type="text" value="<?php echo $nama_supplier; ?>" ... />
  <input type="text" value="<?php echo $alamat_supplier; ?>" ... />
  <input type="text" value="<?php echo $notelp_supplier; ?>" ... />
```
- A sample payload is provided:
```
<img src=x onerRor=alert(document.cookie)>
```
- The affected version is specified as v1.0 of the Warehouse Management System from sourcecodester.com.
