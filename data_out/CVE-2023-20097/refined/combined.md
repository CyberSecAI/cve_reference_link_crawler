This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of commands that are issued from a wireless controller to an AP. An attacker with *Administrator* access to the CLI of the controller could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a command with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain full *root* access on the AP.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-aironetap-cmdinj-6bjT4FL8>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable software release in the default configuration:    + 6300 Series Embedded Services APs   + Aironet 1540 Series APs   + Aironet 1560 Series APs   + Aironet 1800 Series APs   + Aironet 2800 Series APs   + Aironet 3800 Series APs   + Aironet 4800 APs   + Catalyst 9100 APs   + Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series APs   + Catalyst IW9165 Heavy Duty Series   + Catalyst IW9165 Rugged Series   + Catalyst IW9167 Heavy Duty Series   + Integrated AP on 1100 Integrated Services Routers For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.
