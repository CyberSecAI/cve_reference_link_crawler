- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation of commands issued from a wireless controller to an access point (AP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-77) due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected AP, potentially gaining full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with administrator access to the CLI of the wireless controller can exploit this vulnerability by issuing a crafted command to the AP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative privileges on the CLI of the wireless controller and be local to the network.
