The warning is from converting double to long, (the cr_tknzr_parse_num returns "double" in num->val)  The red/green/blue values assigned seem to be able to get all "long" scoped values. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1034482#c2)  Mikhail Kasimov   2017-04-19 19:29:09 UTC  ``` CVE-2017-7961 's been assigned: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7961> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1034482#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2017-04-24 13:19:44 UTC  ``` I filed a REJECTION request. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1034482#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-05-03 20:50:13 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1034482) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/700495> Factory / libcroco ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1034482#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-05-23 11:25:56 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.
