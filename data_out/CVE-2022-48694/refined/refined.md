The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48694.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of completions generated by the software for outstanding Work Requests (WRs) posted on a Send Queue (SQ) after the Queue Pair (QP) enters an error state. The software was generating completions targeting the wrong Completion Queue (CQ).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect CQ target for SW-generated completions after QP error. This leads to the ib_drain_sq function hanging without receiving expected completions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a system hang due to the `ib_drain_sq` function being blocked indefinitely, leading to denial of service. The affected kworker thread will be blocked in a D state. The system will be unresponsive, and the issue may require a reboot to resolve.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by causing a QP to enter an error state and then attempt to drain the send queue. This can be achieved through various RDMA operations that could lead to an error condition, although the specific methods are not defined in this document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the RDMA subsystem and have the ability to cause a QP to enter an error state. This likely implies local access or the ability to send malformed or invalid RDMA requests to the target.
