- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the ACON library's input-handling functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-generated data. Specifically, insufficient validation allows malicious input data to bypass checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on systems using the ACON library, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Submitting malicious input data to the ACON library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the machine learning application using the ACON library. This could be through a network, or via other ways to interact with the application. Specifically, applications that ingest user-generated data without proper sanitization are the most vulnerable.
