- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure occurs while parsing specially crafted TIFF files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted TIFF file with a vulnerable application (JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious TIFF file using a vulnerable version of the software.
