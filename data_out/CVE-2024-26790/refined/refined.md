Root cause of vulnerability:
The ls1028a chip may hang on 16-byte unaligned read transactions initiated by the QDMA (Quick Direct Memory Access).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Unaligned read transactions by QDMA can stall in the Network On-Chip (NOC), leading to a deadlock. This can trigger completion timeouts in the PCIe controller.

Impact of exploitation:
The system may hang due to the deadlock condition, causing a denial of service.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be triggered by initiating unaligned 16-byte read transactions via the QDMA.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to trigger QDMA operations with 16-byte unaligned reads. This would typically require some form of privileged access to control DMA operations.

Additional notes:
The fix involves enabling prefetching by setting the source descriptor prefetchable bit (SD[PF] = 1) which serves as a workaround.
