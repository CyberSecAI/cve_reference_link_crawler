Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue related to the password reset functionality in HaloITSM.
- By manipulating a password reset request, an attacker can inject malicious content into the reset link sent to the victim's email.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper handling or sanitization of user-supplied data within the password reset request.
- The password reset link is susceptible to manipulation, leading to potential token leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If a user clicks on the manipulated (poisoned) password reset link, the password reset token can be leaked to the attacker.
- An attacker could potentially use the leaked token to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker exploits the password forgotten functionality.
- The attacker manipulates a password reset request before it is sent to the victim.
- The manipulation causes a malicious link to be embedded in the password reset email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the password forgotten functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate a password reset request in a specific way.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have special privileges within the HaloITSM system.

**Affected Versions:**
- Halo versions up to 2.143.61
- All 2.144 and 2.145 versions

**Patched Versions:**
- Any patch >= 2.143.61
- Any version >= 2.146.1

**Mitigation:**
- Hosted instances were automatically patched on 2024-04-19.
- On-premises installations must apply the latest stable or beta patch to their Halo instance.
