## Enterprise Server 3.10.17

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.17](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.17/download)

September 23, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.10.17: Security fixes](#3.10.17-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could steal sensitive information by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the repository transfer feature. This exploitation would require social engineering. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8770](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8770) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could push a commit with changes to a workflow using a PAT or OAuth app that lacks the appropriate `workflow` scope by pushing a triple-nested tag pointing at the associated commit. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8263](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8263) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** A GitHub App installed in organizations could upgrade some permissions from read to write access without approval from an organization administrator. An attacker would require an account with administrator access to install a malicious GitHub App. GitHub has requested [CVE ID CVE-2024-8810](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8810) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.10.17: Bug fixes](#3.10.17-bugs)

* For instances deployed on AWS with IMDSv2 enforced, fallback to private IPs was not successful.
* A config apply run may not have been properly applied due to calls being made to Nomad before it was ready to accept connections. When this occurred, the `Error querying agent info: failed querying self endpoint: Get "http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/agent/self"` error was written to the `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log` file.
* When configuring a high availability replica and during the database seeding of a MySQL replica node, restarting the `nomad` service could time out. Consequently, when MySQL replication attempted to start an error was reported, and setting up replication failed.
* When importing using `ghe-migrator`, team URLs containing dots were imported as-is, leading to 404s when attempting to view the imported teams. Dots in imported team URLs are now escaped to dashes.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-status` command returned an error if a soft-deleted repository had a checksum mismatch.
* Some repositories could miss spokes information after restoring in a clustering topology due to unrescued exceptions.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
* The `CommandPalette` component no longer displays repository information on `404` pages, preventing the leakage of private repository information for users without access.
* Custom links to other repositories displayed incorrect breadcrumbs.
* When a GitHub App installation had all repositories installed individually, it was not possible to remove the repositories from the selection.
* After an administrator enabled maintenance mode from an instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator was redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode was not enabled.
* Some custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering. You may want to edit and republish your custom patterns. You can manually republish custom patterns with the following command: `ghe-secret-scanning jobs queue custom-patterns republish --custom-pattern-id=?`. Outdated alerts caused by edits during custom pattern backfills have been fixed in version 3.13 and above.
### [3.10.17: Changes](#3.10.17-changes)

* For instances deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), site administrators can configure regional AWS STS endpoints for OIDC from the Management Console.
### [3.10.17: Known issues](#3.10.17-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as `127.0.0.1`.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* The `reply.[hostname]` subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via management console without subdomain isolation.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
## Enterprise Server 3.10.16

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.16](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.16/download)

August 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.16-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.16: Features](#3.10.16-features)

* Users can view the app state of gists, networks, and wikis in the `spokesctl info` output, enhancing visibility into the status of these elements. Additionally, `spokesctl check` can diagnose and, in most cases, fix empty repository networks, improving network management.
### [3.10.16: Security fixes](#3.10.16-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL:** On GitHub Enterprise Server instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with specific IdPs utilizing publicly exposed signed federation metadata XML, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user account with site administrator privileges. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6800](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6800) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the issue contents from a private repository using a GitHub App with only `contents: read` and `pull requests: write` permissions. This was only exploitable via user access token, and installation access tokens were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6337](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6337) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.16: Bug fixes](#3.10.16-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during a hotpatch upgrade, a race condition could block various upgrade activities.
* The `ghe-config-apply` process made an unnecessary number of connections to Redis.
* Instances installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) could have their hostname overwritten by GCP when a hotpatch was applied.
* The minimum password requirements for Management Console users and the root site administrator required an upper case character when providing a password with a minimum of 8 characters, contradicting the documentation and password hint.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, configuration runs created subdomains for ChatOps services, such as `slack.HOSTNAME` and `teams.HOSTNAME`, regardless of whether the service was enabled.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
* Some users were unable to delete project views.
* Due to a regression introduced in a previous patch, for enterprises that use encrypted SAML assertions, SSO attempts failed with a digest mismatch error if the entire SAML response was signed, rather than just the assertions.
* Running `go get` for a Golang repository with a directory structure that overlaps with GitHub UI routes failed
* The `github-stream-processor` service could get into a state where it would continually fail to process messages with a `TRILOGY_CLOSED_CONNECTION` error.
* A corrupted entry in the Git audit log could cause out of memory errors.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
### [3.10.16: Changes](#3.10.16-changes)

* Actions KPI logs are disabled by default to reduce log size.
* Audit log events related to audit log streaming are available in the enterprise audit log page, and via audit log streaming.
### [3.10.16: Known issues](#3.10.16-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* The `reply.HOSTNAME` subdomain is falsely displayed as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via the Management Console without subdomain isolation.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
### [3.10.16: Errata](#3.10.16-errata)

* These release notes previously indicated as a known issue that on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.16 when log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
  The fix for this problem was already included in GitHub Enterprise Server [3.10.15](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/release-notes#3.10.15-bugs). [Updated: 2024-09-16]
## Enterprise Server 3.10.15

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.15](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.15/download)

July 19, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

Due to a bug that caused hotpatch upgrades to fail for instances on Microsoft Azure, the previous patch release in this series (**3.10.14**) is not available for download. The following release notes include the updates introduced in that release.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.14-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.15: Security fixes](#3.10.15-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could cause unbounded resource exhaustion on the instance by sending a large payload to the Git server. To mitigate this issue, GitHub has limited the count of "have" and "want" lines for Git read operations. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5795](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5795) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An improper privilege management vulnerability allowed users to migrate private repositories without having appropriate scopes defined on the related personal access token. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5566](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5566) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized access in a public repository using a suspended GitHub App via a scoped user access token. This was only exploitable in public repositories while private repositories were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5816](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5816) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could execute a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to perform write operations on a victim-owned repository in GitHub Enterprise Server by exploiting incorrect request types. A mitigating factor is that the attacker has to be a trusted user and the victim has to visit a tag in the attacker's fork of their own repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5815) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the name of a private repository on the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance when the private repository has a deploy key associated to it. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6395](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6395) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **LOW:** Instance administrators could see fine-grained personal access tokens in plaintext in the babeld and gitauth logs.
* **LOW:** An attacker with read access to a project could use the REST API to view a list of all members in an organization, including members who had made their membership private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **LOW:** An attacker could include MathJax syntax in Markdown to bypass GitHubs normal restrictions on CSS properties in Markdown. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose sensitive information from a private repository exploiting organization ruleset features. This attack required an organization member to explicitly change the visibility of a dependent repository from private to public. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6336](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6336) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized read access to issue content inside an internal repository via GitHub projects. This attack required attacker access to the corresponding project board. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5817](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5817) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Firewall port 9199, which linked to a static maintenance page used when enabling maintenance mode with an IP exception list, was opened unnecessarily.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.15: Bug fixes](#3.10.15-bugs)

* When an instance hosted on Azure was upgraded with a hotpatch, the upgrade failed with an `rsync` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, remote blob storage could fill up with large amounts of data because cleanup jobs were skipped on old hosts.
* In some cases, commands run in an administrative SSH shell were not written to the audit log.
* When an administrator submitted support data to GitHub Support, spokesd keys were incorrectly sanitized.
* When log forwarding was enabled, some specific service logs, including babeld, gitauth, unicorn, and resqued, were duplicated.
* During the initial boot of an instance, a data disk attached as `/dev/sdb` may not have been recognized as an available disk.
* In some cases, the HAProxy `kill_timeout` setting caused service outages during upgrades or large transactions.
* The `ssh-audit-log.sh` script did not effectively log SSH commands, and the `ghe-sanitize-log.psed` script inadequately sanitized password-related logs.
* The default MSSQL timeout of 8 seconds sometimes caused issues during administrator activities. The default timeout has been increased to 30 seconds.
* For an instance running on Microsoft Azure, the user disk service failed to start because the attached volume could not be found.
* Establishing a new GitHub Connect connection could fail with a 500 error.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to migrate a repository, the links for pull requests merge commits were not imported.
* In some cases, reading data from repositories with a large number of objects would result in timeout or error.
* When a user used the REST API endpoints that returned secret scanning alerts at the repository or organization level with non-cursor-based pagination (for example, without `before` or `after` query parameters), the REST API endpoints for secret scanning returned incorrect `Link` headers.
* On instances with SAML authentication configured, users were unable to sign out and became stuck in an infinite SAML SSO loop.
* Deleting a branch that was targeted by many pull requests could result in delayed job processing and increased system memory usage.
* On an instance that restricts emails to verified domains, secret scanning emails would sometimes be sent to an unverified domain.
* In some cases, on the "Files" tab of a pull request, a comment on the first line did not render.
* Some organizations were not recognized as part of an instance's enterprise account.
* Some users would encounter an error when navigating to their personal security settings page at `https://HOSTNAME/settings/security`.
* On the "Code scanning" page of a repository, the branch filter did not correctly display all branches.
* Users viewing the alerts index page experienced inconsistencies in rendering the closed alert state.
* Organizations named "C" were incorrectly routed to the GitHub Enterprise Server contact page instead of their organization page.
* When servers responded with unsupported characters, webhook deliveries were not displayed in the UI.
* Chat integrations required frequent reauthentication, as a result of new app installations overwriting previous ones.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command did not select the correct Nomad container when running a command within a git repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, disabling and re-enabling GitHub Advanced Security for an organization resulted in redundant scans of some repositories.
### [3.10.15: Changes](#3.10.15-changes)

* The timeout for requests made to the REST API endpoints for secret scanning has been extended.
* When a user changes a repository's visibility to public, the user is now warned that previous Actions history and logs will become public as well.
* When using the `ghe-webhook-logs` utility, webhook delivery logs can be filtered by event and action. Users can use `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues` to filter by event, or `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues.opened` to filter by event and action.
### [3.10.15: Known issues](#3.10.15-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.12-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.12: Security fixes](#3.10.12-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL**: On instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user with administrator privileges.

  Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions are not impacted. Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow unauthorized access to the instance without requiring prior authentication. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-4985](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4985) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).

  For more information, see [Configuring SAML single sign-on for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise) and [Enabling encrypted assertions](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/enabling-encrypted-assertions).
### [3.10.12: Known issues](#3.10.12-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.10: Bug fixes](#3.10.10-bugs)

* When configuring audit log streaming to Datadog or Splunk on an instance with custom CA certificates, the connection failed with the error `There was an error trying to connect`.
* Disk usage, utilization, and latency for data devices could render incorrectly in Grafana.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, former primary nodes were able to access the newly promoted nodes after failover. The `ghe-cluster-failover` command has been updated to block access from the old cluster, and four new command-line utilities have been introduced to manually block IP addresses: `ghe-cluster-block-ips`, `ghe-cluster-block-ip`, `ghe-cluster-unblock-ips`, and `ghe-cluster-unblock-ip`. For more information, see [Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-failover). [Updated: 2024-05-01]
* The `ghe-update-check` command did not clean up .tmp files in `/var/lib/ghe-updates/`, which could lead to full disk issues.
* On an instance that failed a configuration run, when attempting to repeat the restore step of a backup, the audit log restore step returned error lines even though audit logs were being fully restored.
* In some cases, Treelights timeouts caused pull requests to return a 500 error.
* The web UI presented inapplicable fine-grained permissions for assignment to custom repository roles. The permissions were also displayed as implicitly included in certain base roles.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some searches for secret scanning alerts resulted in a `500` error.
* The profile settings for organizations displayed a warning about profile images that does not apply to organizations on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* Administrators could get a 500 error when trying to access the "File storage" section of the site admin dashboard.
* Setting a maintenance message failed if the message contained a multibyte character.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, metrics for custom patterns alerts incorrectly included tokens in ignored locations.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, on the tool status page for code scanning, outdated upload errors were still displayed after a successful upload.
* On an instance where user avatars had been deleted directly from the database, an identicon avatar was not correctly displayed for affected users, and administrators may have observed a relatively high number of application exceptions.
### [3.10.10: Changes](#3.10.10-changes)

* On an instance hosted on Azure, administrators can set and reset SSH keys and passwords via the Azure Agent.
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated. For details, see the "Security fixes" section of these release notes. Existing users with the editor role will be unable to log in to the Management Console, and should contact their site administrator requesting that access be reinstated by updating the user to the operator role if appropriate.
* Administrators can improve the performance of "Create a new repository" and "Create a new fork" pages by running this command: `ghe-config app.github.create-repo-perf true && ghe-config-apply`.
### [3.10.10: Known issues](#3.10.10-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

March 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.9-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.9: Security fixes](#3.10.9-security-fixes)

* **HIGH:** An attacker with an Administrator role in GitHub Enterprise Server could gain SSH root access via remote code execution. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2469](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2469) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring GeoJSON settings. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.9: Bug fixes](#3.10.9-bugs)

* In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
* Redundant messages caused an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`.
* Administrators could initiate an SSH audit that unknowingly unverified all SSH keys.
* Attributes used to debug LDAP issues were not included in system logs.
* In some cases, the `codeload` service could panic during shutdown and not terminate gracefully.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, the `ghe-spokesctl` command failed when run on a replica node.
* If an administrator lost SSH access to an instance, authentication from the hypervisor console using the password for the root site administrator would fail.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`
* Organizations using projects (classic) returned an error log about a soon-to-be deprecated MySQL feature when viewing a project.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, Jupyter notebooks did not render correctly.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with many nodes, requests to the REST API for managing GitHub Enterprise Server would exceed the instance's HTTP timeouts.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the pattern's alerts.
* When an administrator set a policy to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for an enterprise, a message incorrectly indicated that users without 2FA enabled on their account would be removed from the enterprise. These users will be removed from repositories and organizations in the enterprise, but not from the enterprise itself.
* Some API endpoints for projects did not properly filter target repositories based on the users access.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
* When using GitHub Enterprise Importer to import repositories, `ghost` users in archive metadata files would cause an error when generating a list of migration conflicts using `ghe-migrator conflicts`.
* After an administrator ran `ghe-saml-mapping-csv`, the output did not include the corresponding SQL query.
* During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, rebuilds of GitHub Pages sites failed if no replicas of the GitHub Pages data were available (for example, on a newly restored cluster).
* In some cases, manual repository maintenance using `ghe-spokesctl` would fail with the following error: `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9 or 3.10 could be slow if a large number of code scanning analyses were present on the instance.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the speed of migration for code scanning analyses is increased during an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or earlier.
### [3.10.9: Changes](#3.10.9-changes)

* Gists can be deleted using the **Purge Gist** button on the Deleted Gists page in Staff Tools.
* People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding. For more information, see [Deferring database seeding](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/deferring-database-seeding).
* The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the payload for the push webhook will not contain serialized diff information for each commit. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see [Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push) and [REST API endpoints for commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/rest/commits).
### [3.10.9: Known issues](#3.10.9-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, Actions workflows that deploy GitHub Pages sites may fail with the following error:

  ```
  Error: Deployment failed, try again later.

  ```

  To fix this issue, connect to any of the instance's nodes using SSH, then run the following commands.

  ```
  if [ -d "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar" ] ; then
    rm -rf "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar"
  fi
  pages_untar_image_tag="$(cat "$CHROOT_PATH/data/docker-image-tags/pages_untar_image_tag")"
  id="$(docker create "pages-untar:$pages_untar_image_tag")"
  sudo docker cp "$id:/data/pages-untar" "$BASE_PATH/$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar/"
  docker rm "$id"
  ``` [Updated: 2024-03-07]

  ```
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
## Enterprise Server 3.10.5

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.5](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.5/download)

January 16, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.5-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.5: Security fixes](#3.10.5-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges through a command injection vulnerability in the Management Console. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0507](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0507) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: An attacker could leverage an unsafe reflection vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) that could lead to reflection injection. This vulnerability could lead to the execution of user-controlled methods and remote code execution. To exploit this bug, an actor would need to be logged into an account on the GHES instance with the [organization owner role](/en/enterprise-server%403.15/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners). GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0200](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0200) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.5: Bug fixes](#3.10.5-bugs)

* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server using GitHub CLI OAuth App with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* During periods of high load, users would see intermittent interruptions to services when upstream services failed internal health checks.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, site administrators using the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API may have seen a status of `UNKNOWN` for the MSSQL service.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Deleting a repository would enqueue unnecessary background jobs that would never complete.
* When creating a new custom pattern for secret scanning, the "More options" section of the custom pattern form automatically collapsed when a user entered an invalid regex in the post processing expressions (before/after secret match or additional secret requirements).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, users could experience a `500` error when viewing a secret scanning alert page in cases where the alerted commits belonged to the user and one or more commits could not be found.
* Members of an enterprise were incorrectly allowed access to the REST API endpoints for Enterprise licensing.
* On an instance that uses SAML for authentication, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 to 3.9 could result in user login failures due to an outdated gem dependency.
### [3.10.5: Changes](#3.10.5-changes)

* To avoid leaking secrets, the logging of all parameters is disabled for Management Console events in enterprise audit logs.
* More detailed information is logged when a GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade failed due to missing database encryption keys.
* The branch protection setting to require PR approval of the most recent reviewable push is included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
### [3.10.5: Known issues](#3.10.5-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).

## Enterprise Server 3.10.4

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.4](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.4/download)

December 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.4-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.4: Security fixes](#3.10.4-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An improper authentication vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a bypass of private mode by using a specially crafted API request. Private mode is the mechanism that enforces authentication for publicly-scoped resources. For more information, see [Enabling private mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-private-mode).

  This vulnerability would allow unauthenticated attackers to gain access to various types of resources set as public on the instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance configured in private mode. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-6847](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6847).
* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges by making requests to the endpoint used for bootstrapping the instance, and then reset the root site administrator password. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46647](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46647) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an insufficient entropy vulnerability, an attacker could brute force a user invitation to the Management Console. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed knowledge that a user invitation was pending. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46648](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46648).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access via a race condition when an organization was converted from a user. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46649](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46649) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an improper access control, an attacker could view private repository names by enumerating check run IDs with the "Get a check run" API endpoint. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content other than the name. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a transferred repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions during the transfer. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6690](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6690) for this vulnerability, which reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file in the audit log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that that could allow an attacker to gain access to the Management Console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6802) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: A race condition in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an outside collaborator to be added while a repository is being transferred. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6803](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6803) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Improper privilege management allowed arbitrary workflows to be committed and run using an improperly scoped personal access token. To exploit this, a workflow must have already existed in the target repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6804](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6804) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
* **LOW:** Pre-receive hooks have been further hardened against shell command injections.
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see [Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps).
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.4: Bug fixes](#3.10.4-bugs)

* In rare cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a failed check on a deleted repository could cause upgrades to a new version of GitHub Enterprise Server to fail.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, site administrators using the `ghe-repl-status` command-line utility may have seen a status of `UNKNOWN` for the MSSQL service.
* When an administrator ran the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, the `-p` flag did not produce bundles with log durations as specified. The duration period can now only be specified in `days`. Additionally, unnecessary files were sanitized by the commands.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, site administrators using the `ghe-config-apply` utility may have seen the extraneous message "Error: Server closed the connection" in the logs for the utility.
* Some OAuth applications did not have device code flow (DCF) explicitly enabled, which prevented DCF from running correctly.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, upgrades could fail due to a background job running during database migration.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, site administrators using the `ghe-secret-scanning` command would not see a relevant error message if their input was invalid.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, the `ghe-repl-teardown` command failed when provided with a UUID.
* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server from Visual Studio Code with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* In some cases, when an administrator uploaded a custom TLS certificate, the certificate was not correctly installed on the instance.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role could not update custom links for push protection using the REST API.
* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, some security products were not automatically enabled for new public repositories.
* Pull request review threads at the file level, rather than the individual line level, were not included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
* Some responses from the REST API included an incorrect URL in the `link` header.
* After importing a migration archive using `ghe-migrator` or REST API endpoints for organization migrations, in some cases, some review comments within pull requests were not associated with lines of code.
* In some cases, `/stafftools/users/:login` incorrectly displayed trade screening information.
* Deprecated `resource_activity` jobs were not processed and accumulated over time in the queue, causing possible memory issues.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alert emails were sent to organization owners even if their email address did not comply with domain restrictions.
* After a user started a repository transfer, if another user viewed the repository before the transfer finished, the repository overview rendered incorrectly.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect and unified search enabled, users trying to view the unified search code results would get a 500 error.
* On some instances, the user interface displayed a codespace button, even though GitHub Codespaces is not supported on GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, users occasionally got a 500 error when viewing a job with a pending deployment.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, an issue with `GH_TOKEN` sometimes prevented GitHub Pages sites from building successfully in workflows.
* An administrator could enable GitHub Connect on an instance with a license that does not support GitHub Connect.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* The enterprise account pages on some installations rendered very slowly.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to import repositories into GitHub Enterprise Server, the `conflicts` and `audit` subcommands produced an invalid CSV file due to an extra log line appended to the file.
* Pre-receive hook failures were not visible in the administrator audit log.
* Running `ghe-spokesctl gov info` without any arguments caused a `panic` response.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, webhooks for alert locations did not contain information about push protection bypasses.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, code scanning would report an incorrect number of files scanned on the "Tools" status page.
### [3.10.4: Changes](#3.10.4-changes)

* On an instance with Dependabot updates enabled, Dependabot relies on the node installation provided by the actions runner instead of dynamically downloading.
* When adding a node to an instance, performance is improved during initial database replication.
* An administrator can run the new `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command to ensure all upgrade jobs that run in the background have finished. This allows the administrator to know when they can start the next upgrade to their GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* To avoid negative effects on disk utilization, `babeld` log files have a maximum size of 15 GB.
* To improve reliability of release uploads in low-bandwidth environments, the time-to-live (TTL) value of the token for uploading release assets has increased from 1 hour to 3 hours.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* The audit log now tracks all failed password attempts individually. Previously, duplicate failed password attempts in sequence within the same day would be grouped into one failed password attempt, with a `count` field.
### [3.10.4: Known issues](#3.10.4-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  . [Updated 2024-01-03]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2024-02-22]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.10.4: Deprecations](#3.10.4-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see [Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps) and the security fixes for this release.
## Enterprise Server 3.10.3

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.3](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.3/download)

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.3-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.3: Security fixes](#3.10.3-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** Due to an incorrect permission assignment for some configuration files, an attacker with access to a local operating system user account could read MySQL connection details including the MySQL password. [Updated: 2023-11-13]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.3: Bug fixes](#3.10.3-bugs)

* Authentication of programmatic access tokens did not fully validate the status of token's users, which allowed token authentication requests to succeed even if the associated user was not allowed to make such requests. This issue is unrelated to validation of token scope.
* The `dependency-graph-api` service sometimes rapidly filled logs with a large amount of Base64-encoded response data, particularly during upgrades.
* After an administrator made changes to maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator was redirected to the Settings page, but their changes were not enabled.
* The `ghe-cluster-repl-status` command did not display all replication statuses.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, `ghe-config-apply` timed out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when managing maintenance mode using `ghe-cluster-maintenance`, an erroneous warning appeared that read "Warning: Maintenance mode set on primary, please make sure to set it on any active replica if needed".
* `ghe-repl-status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states and incorrectly suggested that a failover could be performed safely. In some cases, this led to data loss during failover.
* Repository exports using `ghe-migrator` or the REST API's operation for organization migrations could fail when a large number of commit comments or long commit comments were present.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning suggested incorrect filters when viewing both open and closed alerts.
* On instances using the private beta of SCIM provisioning, some users were presented with a "single sign-in" hover card.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ghe-spokes status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states, causing a false report that replication was in sync and leading to data loss or replication issues during failover.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, administrators received a `500` error after attempting to force cancel a workflow run via Staff Tools.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, repositories within organizations created using the `+` dropdown menu did not have GitHub Advanced Security features enabled automatically, even if the features should have been enabled.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.10.3: Changes](#3.10.3-changes)

* Instructions in the "Migrations" section of the Management Console clarify that only standard AWS S3 endpoints are supported when configuring AWS S3 as a blob storage provider for migrations.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. This change strengthens GitHub Pages's symbolic link detection.
### [3.10.3: Known issues](#3.10.3-known-issues)

* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification.

* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up.

* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary.
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion.

## Enterprise Server 3.10.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.1/download)

September 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warnings**:

* This release contains a known issue that may lead to replication issues on an instance in a high-availability, geo-replication, or repository cache configuration. Upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.2 or later instead of this release. For more information, see the [Known issues](#3.10.1-known-issues) section of these release notes.
* A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.1-known-issues) section of these release notes.
### [3.10.1: Security fixes](#3.10.1-security-fixes)

* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766). [Updated: 2023-09-22]
### [3.10.1: Bug fixes](#3.10.1-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, scale sets configured at the enterprise level did not appear for use within the instance's organizations or repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alerts could fail to show an error message in the UI when a failure occurred closing or reopening the alert.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, organization access for a leaked GitHub tokens was not shown to commit authors when viewing the alert.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, when token location(s) included a commit that introduced a large change, the page for viewing the alert would load slowly.
* When uploading migration archives to blob storage, the GitHub Enterprise Server instance's outbound web proxy server was not used.
* On an enterprise with the policy setting that disallows repository admins from enabling/disabling secret scanning, transferring a repository to a new organization that automatically enabled secret scanning wouldn't result in the transferred repository being automatically enabled for secret scanning.
* When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to incorrect asset paths.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
### [3.10.1: Changes](#3.10.1-changes)

* When GitHub Enterprise checks for a new upgrade or hotpatch package, if the check fails the failure details are output to the `ghe-update-check` log, and the Management Console UI provides a "Check Again" button to rerun the check.
* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
### [3.10.1: Known issues](#3.10.1-known-issues)

* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls). [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account). [Updated: 2023-02-23]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310). [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance with a high-availability, geo-replication, or repository cache configuration, a known issue causes the `SpokesRepairRepoReplicaJob` and `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` jobs to fail. This means repository replicas in cache servers are not updated, and will remain out of sync if the repository is updated. Additionally, if a regular repository replica becomes out of sync, repair attempts will fail, causing the corresponding repository network to be marked as failed until a network repair is triggered.

  The network repair will eventually return the repository to a healthy state. However, this process can take several hours for very large and active repositories or networks, potentially leading to prolonged replication issues. [Updated: 2023-09-26]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion. If you observe memory exhaustion on your instance and see a high metric for `resource_activity`, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-12-04]
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext. [Updated: 2023-10-31]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

For more information, see [REST API endpoints for managing GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes) in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + To help users access resources more securely, fine-grained personal access tokens are available in public beta. For more information, see [Managing your personal access tokens](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#about-personal-access-tokens).

    - Users can create fine-grained personal access tokens with access to their personal repositories or, if permitted, organization-owned repositories.
    - Organization and enterprise owners can enable or disable the use of fine-grained personal access tokens in organization-owned repositories, and can use the REST API or GraphQL API to manage tokens in their organizations.
    - Users creating fine-grained tokens for an organization can add the `pre-receive hooks` permission to allow managing pre-receive hooks. For more information, see [Managing pre-receive hooks on your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/policies/enforcing-policy-with-pre-receive-hooks/managing-pre-receive-hooks-on-the-github-enterprise-server-appliance).
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + To find vulnerabilities in specific parts of a project, users with write access to a repository can filter code scanning alerts by language or by file path by using the search queries `language:` and `path:`. For more information, see [Assessing code scanning alerts for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/assessing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository).
  + To help repository administrators and security managers quickly enable automatic code scanning without needing to configure a workflow, default setup for code scanning supports compiled languages including Go, Java, and C. Default setup is now available for all languages supported by CodeQL, except Swift. For more information, see [CodeQL code scanning for compiled languages](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-the-codeql-workflow-for-compiled-languages) and [Supported languages and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) in the CodeQL documentation.
  + Repository administrators and security managers can choose which languages to include or exclude in default setup for code scanning. For more information, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning).
  + To improve analysis of C# code, the release of CodeQL included with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10
    can scan projects that include features from C# 11. For more information, see [What's new in C# 11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-11) in the Microsoft documentation. Support for C# 11 is in beta and subject to change. CodeQL can scan projects built with C# 11 features, but does not analyse the code used for C# 11 features themselves.
  + To help users find vulnerabilities in projects for Swift libraries and Apple apps,
    the release of CodeQL included with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 includes support for Swift, up to version 5.8.1, and Xcode, up to version 14.3.1. Support for Swift is in beta and subject to change. Swift analysis is not supported in default setup for code scanning, and requires the advanced setup. For more information, see [Configuring advanced setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning).
  + To help identify steps to remediate leaked secrets, repository administrators and security managers can view metadata such as the secret owner, expiration date, and access rights for any active GitHub token leaked in a repository. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Managing alerts from secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning#reviewing-github-token-metadata).
  + Repository administrators, security managers, and organization and enterprise owners can view metrics for alerts generated by a specific custom pattern for secret scanning. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning).
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + Dependabot can automatically update the version of Node.js dependencies managed in the pnpm package manager. For more information, see [About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems).
  + To avoid unnecessary compute cost, Dependabot updates are automatically paused in repositories where there has been no activity on pull requests created by Dependabot for 90 days. For more information about the criteria for Dependabot updates being paused, see [About Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-automatic-deactivation-of-dependabot-updates) and [About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#about-automatic-deactivation-of-dependabot-updates).
  + To avoid unnecessary compute cost, Dependabot stops automatically rebasing a pull request for version or security updates if the pull request has been open for 30 days.
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + In the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories), users can search for any historical vulnerability recognized by the National Vulnerability Database. The "Unreviewed advisories" category has been backfilled to include vulnerabilities from previous years. For more information, see [Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database).
  + In the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories), users can search for malware advisories by using the query `type:malware`. Dependabot does not send alerts for malware advisories. For more information, see [Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database).
  + In the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories), users can search for advisories for the Hex package manager, including Elixir, Erlang, and more. Dependabot does not send alerts for Hex advisories. For more information, see [Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database).
  + Organization owners, security managers, and users with admin access to a repository can quickly enable or disable security features for a filtered selection of repositories from the "Security coverage" view in an organization's security overview. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Enabling security features for multiple repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/security-overview/enabling-security-features-for-multiple-repositories).
  + Enterprise owners, organization owners, and security managers can quickly assess adoption of security features and exposure to security vulnerabilities across their enterprise. The enterprise-level "Security coverage" and "Security risk" views in security overview display data for repositories in each organization where the viewer is an organization owner or security manager. These views replace the "Overview" page in the "Code Security" tab for an enterprise. The `risk` metric for filtering the "Overview" page is no longer available. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [About security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/security-overview/about-security-overview#about-security-overview-for-enterprises).
  + Users can find curated security advisories for the Swift ecosystem in the GitHub Advisory Database. For more information, see [About the GitHub Advisory database](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database).
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.304.0. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.304.0). If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release. [Updated: 2024-04-25]
  + Organization owners can increase instance security by preventing members from creating self-hosted runners at the repository level. For more information, see [Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization).
  + Users with admin access to a repository can allow external systems and third-party services to approve or reject deployments across organizations, repositories, and environments by enabling custom deployment protection rules. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#custom-deployment-protection-rules).
  + The option to execute custom scripts on a self-hosted runner is no longer is beta. For more information, see [Running scripts before or after a job](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/running-scripts-before-or-after-a-job#about-pre--and-post-job-scripts).
  + To prevent unnecessary transfer of OIDC tokens between workflows, to fetch an OIDC token generated within a reusable workflow that is outside their enterprise or organization, users must set the `id-token` permission to `write` in the workflow or specific job where the reusable workflow is called. For more information, see [Configuring OpenID Connect in cloud providers](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-cloud-providers#adding-permissions-settings).
  + Repository administrators, organization owners, and users with the `manage_runners:enterprise` scope for enterprises can use the REST API to create ephemeral, just-in-time (JIT) runners that can perform at most one job before being automatically removed from the repository, organization, or enterprise. For more information, see [Security hardening for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-just-in-time-runners).
* #### [Community experience](#community-experience)

  + To improve the accuracy of marked answers in discussions, and reduce the burden on users to duplicate their text to get their answer marked as correct, users can mark threaded replies as the answer to a question.
  + To improve content organization and topic discoverability, GitHub Discussions maintainers can group discussion categories into sections.
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + To prevent unnecessary repository removal, the API for managing the repositories accessible by a GitHub App in your organization has been updated to fail early if the application is currently granted access to `all` repositories in the organization. This API can only be used to remove a repository when the application has been granted access to an explicit list of repositories. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for GitHub App installations](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/rest/apps/installations#remove-a-repository-from-an-app-installation).
  + Repository administrators can ensure the security and stability of branches by requiring pull request approval by someone other than the last pusher. For more information, see [About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging).
* #### [Projects](#projects)

  + Projects is no longer in public beta, and is now considered generally available. For more information, see [About Projects](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects).
  + To control the amount of work in progress and promote focus, on a board layout, users with admin access to a project can set a recommended limit on the number of items in a column. For more information, see [Customizing the board layout](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-board-layout#setting-a-limit-on-the-number-of-items-in-a-column).
  + To determine the default access rights organization members have to projects where they haven't been granted individual access, organization owners can set a base role for projects. For more information, see [Managing access to your projects](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects#managing-access-for-organization-level-projects).
  + To share a pre-configured project with other people in an organization, users with admin access to a project can set the project as a template. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Managing project templates in your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-project-templates-in-your-organization).
  + In a table layout, users can select and update multiple cells at once by clicking and dragging or using the `Shift` or `Ctrl`/`Command` key.
* #### [Commits](#commits)

  + When editing a file in the user interface, users with permission to bypass branch protection rules receive a note if their commit will bypass a rule, with the option to create a new branch instead of committing directly to the protected branch. Previously, the commit was added to the protected branch directly, without indication that a rule was being bypassed.
  + When using `git push` from the command line, users with permission to bypass branch protection rules receive a note if they have pushed a commit that bypasses a rule. Previously there was no indication after a Git push that branch rules had been bypassed.
* #### [Markdown](#markdown)

  + Users can include mathematical expressions within Markdown by using LaTeX syntax delimited by `$` characters and backticks. For more information, see [Writing mathematical expressions](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions#writing-inline-expressions).
* #### [Accessibility](#accessibility)

  + To make GitHub inclusive to all developers, GitHub has improved color contrast of the default light and dark themes, making them accessible to all users. These changes were made to Primer, [GitHub's Design System](https://primer.style/). For more information, see [GitHub Accessibility](https://accessibility.github.com/).
### [3.10.0: Changes](#3.10.0-changes)

* Field names and destinations for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed in this release and the prior release. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

  + `level` is now `SeverityText`.
  + `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
  + `now` is now `Timestamp`.
  + Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
  + Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  For a full list of field mappings, download the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv) and the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10](/assets/ghes-3.10-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv). This change is part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and additional field names will change in upcoming releases.
* Users who use pull requests with protected branches may be affected by the following security measures.

  + Merge commits created locally and pushed to a protected branch are rejected if the contents of the commit differ from the merge commit predicted by GitHub.
  + If the branch protection rule for dismissing stale reviews is active, an approving review is dismissed if the merge base changes after the review was submitted. The merge base is the commit that is the latest common ancestor of the pull request branch and the protected branch.
  + A pull request approval only counts towards the pull request it was submitted for. Previously, approvals were gathered across multiple independent pull requests if the pull request branches pointed to the same commit and targeted the same base branch.
* The `PUT` and `DELETE` operations on the `/installations/{installation_id}/repositories/{repository_id}` endpoint are no longer functional for the management of GitHub App installations. You can add or remove a repository from an app installation using the documented APIs instead. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for GitHub App installations](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/rest/apps/installations).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, to make it easier to assess vulnerabilities to exposed secrets, enterprise owners and organization owners receive a single email with the results of the historical scan for secrets that is performed when secret scanning is first enabled in an organization or enterprise. Previously, secret scanning sent an email for each repository where secrets were detected. For more information, see [About secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning#about-secret-scanning-alerts-for-users).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in the "Files changed" view of pull requests, GitHub only displays code scanning alerts for vulnerabilities detected in lines that a pull request has changed. Previously, code scanning displayed all alerts unique to the pull request branch, even if they were unrelated to the changes the pull request introduced.
### [3.10.0: Backups](#3.10.0-backups)

* To generate backups of an instance more quickly, in GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.10.0 and later, the job for pruning snapshots is no longer performed as part of the `ghe-backup` tool. Site administrators can prune snapshots manually or on a schedule by running the `ghe-prune-snapshots` job. For more information, see [Scheduling backups](https://github.com/github/backup-utils/blob/master/docs/scheduling-backups.md) in the `github/backup-utils` repository.
* To reduce the data transfer required to regularly back up an instance, GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.10.0 and later allows administrators to perform incremental backups of a MySQL 8 database. For more information, see [Making a Differential or Incremental Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/mysqlbackup.incremental.html) in the MySQL documentation.
### [3.10.0: Known issues](#3.10.0-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted. Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310). [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls). [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-09-04]
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser. [Updated: 2023-09-19]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes. [Updated: 2023-09-21]
* On an instance with a high-availability, geo-replication, or repository cache configuration, a known issue causes the `SpokesRepairRepoReplicaJob` and `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` jobs to fail. This means repository replicas in cache servers are not updated, and will remain out of sync if the repository is updated. Additionally, if a regular repository replica becomes out of sync, repair attempts will fail, causing the corresponding repository network to be marked as failed until a network repair is triggered.

  The network repair will eventually return the repository to a healthy state. However, this process can take several hours for very large and active repositories or networks, potentially leading to prolonged replication issues. [Updated: 2023-09-26]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion. If you observe memory exhaustion on your instance and see a high metric for `resource_activity`, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-12-04]
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext. [Updated: 2023-10-31]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

## Enterprise Server 3.9.18

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.18](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.18/download)

July 19, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

Due to a bug that caused hotpatch upgrades to fail for instances on Microsoft Azure, the previous patch release in this series (**3.9.17**) is not available for download. The following release notes include the updates introduced in that release.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.17-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.18: Security fixes](#3.9.18-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could cause unbounded resource exhaustion on the instance by sending a large payload to the Git server. To mitigate this issue, GitHub has limited the count of "have" and "want" lines for Git read operations. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5795](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5795) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An improper privilege management vulnerability allowed users to migrate private repositories without having appropriate scopes defined on the related personal access token. GitHub has requested CVE ID CVE-2024-5566 for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized access in a public repository using a suspended GitHub App via a scoped user access token. This was only exploitable in public repositories while private repositories were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5816](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5816) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could execute a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to perform write operations on a victim-owned repository in GitHub Enterprise Server by exploiting incorrect request types. A mitigating factor is that the attacker has to be a trusted user and the victim has to visit a tag in the attacker's fork of their own repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5815) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose sensitive information from a private repository exploiting organization ruleset features. This attack required an organization member to explicitly change the visibility of a dependent repository from private to public. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6336](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6336) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized read access to issue content inside an internal repository via GitHub projects. This attack required attacker access to the corresponding project board. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5817](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5817) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **LOW:** An attacker with read access to a project could use the REST API to view a list of all members in an organization, including members who had made their membership private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **LOW:** An attacker could include MathJax syntax in Markdown to bypass GitHubs normal restrictions on CSS properties in Markdown. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* Firewall port 9199, which linked to a static maintenance page used when enabling maintenance mode with an IP exception list, was opened unnecessarily.
### [3.9.18: Bug fixes](#3.9.18-bugs)

* When an instance hosted on Azure was upgraded with a hotpatch, the upgrade failed with an `rsync` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, remote blob storage could fill up with large amounts of data because cleanup jobs were skipped on old hosts.
* The memory limit for a Redis job was too low in some cases, causing the process to run out of memory.
* In some cases, commands run in an administrative SSH shell were not written to the audit log.
* When an administrator submitted a support data to GitHub Support, spokesd keys were incorrectly sanitized.
* When log forwarding was enabled, some specific service logs, including babeld, gitauth, unicorn, and resqued, were duplicated.
* During the initial boot of an instance, a data disk attached as `/dev/sdb` may not have been recognized as an available disk.
* In some cases, the HAProxy `kill_timeout` setting caused service outages during upgrades or large transactions.
* The `ssh-audit-log.sh` script did not effectively log SSH commands, and the `ghe-sanitize-log.psed` script inadequately sanitized password-related logs
* The default MSSQL timeout of 8 seconds sometimes caused issues during administrator activities. The default timeout has been increased to 30 seconds.
* For an instance running on Microsoft Azure, the user disk service failed to start because the attached volume could not be found.
* Establishing a new GitHub Connect connection could fail with a 500 error.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to migrate a repository, the links for pull requests merge commits were not imported.
* In some cases, reading data from repositories with a large number of objects would result in timeout or error.
* On an instance that restricts emails to verified domains, secret scanning emails would sometimes be sent to an unverified domain.
* In some cases, on the "Files" tab of a pull request, a comment on the first line did not render.
* Some organizations were not recognized as part of an instance's enterprise account.
* On the "Code scanning" page of a repository, the branch filter did not correctly display all branches.
* Users viewing the alerts index page experienced inconsistencies in rendering the closed alert state.
* Organizations named "C" were incorrectly routed to the GitHub Enterprise Server contact page instead of their organization page.
* Chat integrations required frequent reauthentication, as a result of new app installations overwriting previous ones.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command did not select the correct Nomad container when running a command within a git repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, disabling and re-enabling GitHub Advanced Security for an organization resulted in redundant scans of some repositories.
### [3.9.18: Changes](#3.9.18-changes)

* When a user changes a repository's visibility to public, the user is now warned that previous Actions history and logs will become public as well.
### [3.9.18: Known issues](#3.9.18-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  .
* The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
* *Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.*
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.

  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  .
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
## Enterprise Server 3.9.13

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.13](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.13/download)

April 18, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.13-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.13: Security fixes](#3.9.13-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with the editor role in the Management Console could gain administrative SSH access to the appliance by command injection when configuring the chat integration. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-3646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). The editor role has been deprecated. For more information, see the "Changes" section of these release notes.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring Artifact & Logs and Migrations Storage. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3684](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3684) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a detached repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions while the repository is detached. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2440](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2440) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* A GraphQL endpoint was disabled as part of a previous security fix, causing errors with the "Auto-add to project" workflow and with issue creation from within a project. To resolve these errors, a security patch has been applied and the affected GraphQL endpoint has been re-enabled.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.13: Bug fixes](#3.9.13-bugs)

* When configuring audit log streaming to Datadog or Splunk on an instance with custom CA certificates, the connection failed with the error `There was an error trying to connect`.
* Disk usage, utilization, and latency for data devices could render incorrectly in Grafana.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, former primary nodes were able to access the newly promoted nodes after failover. The `ghe-cluster-failover` command has been updated to block access from the old cluster, and four new command-line utilities have been introduced to manually block IP addresses: `ghe-cluster-block-ips`, `ghe-cluster-block-ip`, `ghe-cluster-unblock-ips`, and `ghe-cluster-unblock-ip`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-failover)." [Updated: 2024-05-01]
* The `ghe-update-check` command did not clean up .tmp files in `/var/lib/ghe-updates/`, which could lead to full disk issues.
* On an instance that failed a configuration run, when attempting to repeat the restore step of a backup, the audit log restore step returned error lines even though audit logs were being fully restored.
* In some cases, Treelights timeouts caused pull requests to return a 500 error.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some searches for secret scanning alerts resulted in a `500` error.
* The web UI presented inapplicable fine-grained permissions for assignment to custom repository roles. The permissions were also displayed as implicitly included in certain base roles.
* The profile settings for organizations displayed a warning about profile images that does not apply to organizations on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* Administrators could get a 500 error when trying to access the "File storage" section of the site admin dashboard.
* On an instance where user avatars had been deleted directly from the database, an identicon avatar was not correctly displayed for affected users, and administrators may have observed a relatively high number of application exceptions.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, on the tool status page for code scanning, outdated upload errors were still displayed after a successful upload.
### [3.9.13: Changes](#3.9.13-changes)

* On an instance hosted on Azure, administrators can set and reset SSH keys and passwords via the Azure Agent.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding. For more information, see "[Deferring database seeding](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/deferring-database-seeding)."
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated. For details, see the "Security fixes" section of these release notes. Existing users with the editor role will be unable to log in to the Management Console, and should contact their site administrator requesting that access be reinstated by updating the user to the operator role if appropriate.
### [3.9.13: Known issues](#3.9.13-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs.

### [3.9.12: Security fixes](#3.9.12-security-fixes)

* **HIGH:** An attacker with an Administrator role in GitHub Enterprise Server could gain SSH root access via remote code execution. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2469](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2469) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring GeoJSON settings. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.12: Bug fixes](#3.9.12-bugs)

* In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
* Redundant messages caused an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`.
* Administrators could initiate an SSH audit that unknowingly unverified all SSH keys.
* Attributes used to debug LDAP issues were not included in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, the `ghe-spokesctl` command failed when run on a replica node.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`
* Organizations using projects (classic) returned an error log about a soon-to-be deprecated MySQL feature when viewing a project.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, Jupyter notebooks did not render correctly.
* In some cases, manual repository maintenance using ghe-spokesctl would fail with the following error: panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the pattern's alerts.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with many nodes, requests to the REST API for managing GitHub Enterprise Server would exceed the instance's HTTP timeouts.
* In some cases, the `codeload` service could panic during shutdown and not terminate gracefully.
* When an administrator set a policy to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for an enterprise, a message incorrectly indicated that users without 2FA enabled on their account would be removed from the enterprise. These users will be removed from repositories and organizations in the enterprise, but not from the enterprise itself.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
* When using GitHub Enterprise Importer to import repositories, `ghost` users in archive metadata files would cause an error when generating a list of migration conflicts using `ghe-migrator conflicts`.
* Some API endpoints for projects did not properly filter target repositories based on the users access.
* After an administrator ran `ghe-saml-mapping-csv`, the output did not include the corresponding SQL query.
* During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, rebuilds of GitHub Pages sites failed if no replicas of the GitHub Pages data were available (for example, on a newly restored cluster).
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9 or 3.10 could be slow if a large number of code scanning analyses were present on the instance.
### [3.9.12: Changes](#3.9.12-changes)

* Gists can be deleted using the **Purge Gist** button on the Deleted Gists page in Staff Tools.
* People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
* The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the payload for the push webhook will not contain serialized diff information for each commit. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see "[Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push)" and "[REST API endpoints for commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/commits)."

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  .
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

* When restoring a deleted repository, some metadata associated with the repository, such as packages or project items, did not properly restore.
* During Git data server maintenance, a process that was ran on unsupported GitHub Enterprise Server topologies created a significant amount of system logs but did not perform any repair work.
### [3.9.10: Changes](#3.9.10-changes)

* The default 30 second webhook delivery HTTP timeout can be configured.
### [3.9.10: Known issues](#3.9.10-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  .
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, Actions workflows that deploy GitHub Pages sites may fail with the following error:

  ```
  Error: Deployment failed, try again later.

  ```

  To fix this issue, connect to any of the instance's nodes using SSH, then run the following commands.

  ```
  if [ -d "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar" ] ; then
    rm -rf "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar"
  fi
  pages_untar_image_tag="$(cat "$CHROOT_PATH/data/docker-image-tags/pages_untar_image_tag")"

  sudo docker cp "$id:/data/pages-untar" "$BASE_PATH/$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar/"
  docker rm "$id"
  ``` [Updated: 2024-03-07]

  ```
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.8-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.8: Security fixes](#3.9.8-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges through a command injection vulnerability in the Management Console. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0507](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0507) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: An attacker could leverage an unsafe reflection vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) that could lead to reflection injection. This vulnerability could lead to the execution of user-controlled methods and remote code execution. To exploit this bug, an actor would need to be logged into an account on the GHES instance with the [organization owner role](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners). GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0200](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0200) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.8: Bug fixes](#3.9.8-bugs)

* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server using GitHub CLI OAuth App with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* During periods of high load, users would see intermittent interruptions to services when upstream services failed internal health checks.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Deleting a repository would enqueue unnecessary background jobs that would never complete.
* When creating a new custom pattern for secret scanning, the "More options" section of the custom pattern form automatically collapsed when a user entered an invalid regex in the post processing expressions (before/after secret match or additional secret requirements).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, users could experience a `500` error when viewing a secret scanning alert page in cases where the alerted commits belonged to the user and one or more commits could not be found.
* Members of an enterprise were incorrectly allowed access to the REST API endpoints for Enterprise licensing.
* On an instance that uses SAML for authentication, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 to 3.9 could result in user login failures due to an outdated gem dependency.
### [3.9.8: Changes](#3.9.8-changes)

* To avoid leaking secrets, the logging of all parameters is disabled for Management Console events in enterprise audit logs.
* More detailed information is logged when a GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade failed due to missing database encryption keys.
* The branch protection setting to require PR approval of the most recent reviewable push is included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
### [3.9.8: Known issues](#3.9.8-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  .
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2024-02-22]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

## Enterprise Server 3.9.7

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.7](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.7/download)

December 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.7-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.7: Security fixes](#3.9.7-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An improper authentication vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a bypass of private mode by using a specially crafted API request. Private mode is the mechanism that enforces authentication for publicly-scoped resources. For more information, see "[Enabling private mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-private-mode)."

  This vulnerability would allow unauthenticated attackers to gain access to various types of resources set as public on the instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance configured in private mode. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-6847](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6847).
* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges by making requests to the endpoint used for bootstrapping the instance, and then reset the root site administrator password. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46647](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46647) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an insufficient entropy vulnerability, an attacker could brute force a user invitation to the Management Console. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed knowledge that a user invitation was pending. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46648](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46648).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access via a race condition when an organization was converted from a user. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46649](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46649) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an improper access control, an attacker could view private repository names by enumerating check run IDs with the "Get a check run" API endpoint. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content other than the name. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a transferred repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions during the transfer. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6690](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6690) for this vulnerability, which reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file in the audit log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that that could allow an attacker to gain access to the Management Console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6802) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: A race condition in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an outside collaborator to be added while a repository is being transferred. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6803](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6803) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Improper privilege management allowed arbitrary workflows to be committed and run using an improperly scoped PAT. To exploit this, a workflow must have already existed in the target repo. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6804](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6804) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
* **LOW:** Pre-receive hooks have been further hardened against shell command injections.
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)."
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.7: Bug fixes](#3.9.7-bugs)

* In rare cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a failed check on a deleted repository could cause upgrades to a new version of GitHub Enterprise Server to fail.
* Threads in the Git proxy service `babeld` could crash while reading Git packet lines.
* When an administrator ran the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, the `-p` flag did not produce bundles with log durations as specified. The duration period can now only be specified in `days`. Additionally, unnecessary files were sanitized by the commands.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, site administrators using the `ghe-config-apply` utility may have seen the extraneous message "Error: Server closed the connection" in the logs for the utility.
* Some OAuth applications did not have device code flow (DCF) explicitly enabled, which prevented DCF from running correctly.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, upgrades could fail due to a background job running during database migration.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, site administrators using the `ghe-secret-scanning` command would not see a relevant error message if their input was invalid.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, the `ghe-repl-teardown` command failed when provided with a UUID.
* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server from Visual Studio Code with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* In some cases, when an administrator uploaded a custom TLS certificate, the certificate was not correctly installed on the instance.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role could not update custom links for push protection using the REST API.
* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, some security products were not automatically enabled for new public repositories.
* Deprecated `resource_activity` jobs were not processed and accumulated over time in the queue, causing possible memory issues.
* Pull request review threads at the file level, rather than the individual line level, were not included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
* After importing a migration archive using `ghe-migrator` or REST API endpoints for organization migrations, in some cases, some review comments within pull requests were not associated with lines of code.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alert emails were sent to organization owners even if their email address did not comply with domain restrictions.
* After a user started a repository transfer, if another user viewed the repository before the transfer finished, the repository overview rendered incorrectly.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect and unified search enabled, users trying to view the unified search code results would get a 500 error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, users occasionally got a 500 error when viewing a job with a pending deployment.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, an issue with `GH_TOKEN` sometimes prevented GitHub Pages sites from building successfully in workflows.
* An administrator could enable GitHub Connect on an instance with a license that does not support GitHub Connect.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* The enterprise account pages on some installations rendered very slowly.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to import repositories into GitHub Enterprise Server, the `conflicts` and `audit` subcommands produced an invalid CSV file due to an extra log line appended to the file.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to incorrect asset paths.
* Running `ghe-spokesctl gov info` without any arguments caused a `panic` response.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, webhooks for alert locations did not contain information about push protection bypasses.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, code scanning would report an incorrect number of files scanned on the "Tools" status page.
### [3.9.7: Changes](#3.9.7-changes)

* On an instance with Dependabot updates enabled, Dependabot relies on the node installation provided by the actions runner instead of dynamically downloading.
* When adding a node to an instance, performance is improved during initial database replication.
* An administrator can run the new `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command to ensure all upgrade jobs that run in the background have finished. This allows the administrator to know when they can start the next upgrade to their GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* To avoid negative effects on disk utilization, `babeld` log files have a maximum size of 15 GB.
* Instance administrators can manage search indices for GitHub Discussions from the site admin dashboard.
* To improve reliability of release uploads in low-bandwidth environments, the time-to-live (TTL) value of the token for uploading release assets has increased from 1 hour to 3 hours.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* The audit log now tracks all failed password attempts individually. Previously, duplicate failed password attempts in sequence within the same day would be grouped into one failed password attempt, with a `count` field.
### [3.9.7: Known issues](#3.9.7-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```

* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  . [Updated 2024-01-03]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]

### [3.9.7: Deprecations](#3.9.7-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)" and the security fixes for this release.
## Enterprise Server 3.9.6

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.6](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.6/download)

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.6-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.6: Security fixes](#3.9.6-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** Due to an incorrect permission assignment for some configuration files, an attacker with access to a local operating system user account could read MySQL connection details including the MySQL password. [Updated: 2023-11-13]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.6: Bug fixes](#3.9.6-bugs)

* The REST API did not correctly check the "Users can create organizations" setting. [Updated: 2024-05-30]
* The `ghe-cluster-repl-status` command did not display all replication statuses.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, `ghe-config-apply` timed out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* `SpokesRepairRepoReplicaJob` and `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` jobs failed, causing cache server replicas to not update and potentially prolonging replication issues.
* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when managing maintenance mode using `ghe-cluster-maintenance`, an erroneous warning appeared that read "Warning: Maintenance mode set on primary, please make sure to set it on any active replica if needed". - |
  `ghe-repl-status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states and incorrectly suggested that a failover could be performed safely. In some cases, this led to data loss during failover.
* Repository exports using `ghe-migrator` or the REST API's operation for organization migrations could fail when a large number of commit comments or long commit comments were present.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning suggested incorrect filters when viewing both open and closed alerts.
* On instances using the private beta of SCIM provisioning, some users were presented with a "single sign-in" hover card.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ghe-spokes status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states, causing a false report that replication was in sync and leading to data loss or replication issues during failover.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, administrators received a `500` error after attempting to force cancel a workflow run via Staff Tools.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, repositories within organizations created using the `+` dropdown menu did not have GitHub Advanced Security features enabled automatically, even if the features should have been enabled.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. This change strengthens GitHub Pages's symbolic link detection.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.9.6: Changes](#3.9.6-changes)

* Instructions in the "Migrations" section of the Management Console clarify that only standard AWS S3 endpoints are supported when configuring AWS S3 as a blob storage provider for migrations.
* When running async repository repairs, the output message about scheduling a repair job is more accurate.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
### [3.9.6: Known issues](#3.9.6-known-issues)

* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

## Enterprise Server 3.9.5

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.5](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.5/download)

September 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.5-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.5: Security fixes](#3.9.5-security-fixes)

* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.5: Bug fixes](#3.9.5-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, scale sets configured at the enterprise level did not appear for use within the instance's organizations or repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alerts could fail to show an error message in the UI when a failure occurred closing or reopening the alert.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, when token location(s) included a commit that introduced a large change, the page for viewing the alert would load slowly.
* In some cases, users could reopen a pull request that should not have been able to be reopened.
* When running the `ghe-saml-mapping-csv` CLI command in dry run mode, the operation failed with errors.
* When uploading migration archives to blob storage, the GitHub Enterprise Server instance's outbound web proxy server was not used.
* On an enterprise with the policy setting that disallows repository admins from enabling/disabling secret scanning, transferring a repository to a new organization that automatically enabled secret scanning wouldn't result in the transferred repository being automatically enabled for secret scanning.
* When viewing fine-grained personal access tokens, the permissions text for pre-receive hooks was not visible for selection when filtering by permission.
* When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to incorrect asset paths.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to an extra `/` character in the URL path.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, the software on ephemeral runners would not automatically update to the latest version.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
### [3.9.5: Changes](#3.9.5-changes)

* When listing the node metadata for all nodes using the [Manage GitHub Enterprise Server REST API](/en/enterprise-server/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-all-ghes-node-metadata-for-all-nodes), information about whether a given node is a replica is included.
* When GitHub Enterprise checks for a new upgrade or hotpatch package, if the check fails the failure details are output to the `ghe-update-check` log, and the Management Console UI provides a "Check Again" button to rerun the check.
* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
* When running async repository repairs, the output message about scheduling a repair job is more accurate.
### [3.9.5: Known issues](#3.9.5-known-issues)

* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)." [Updated: 2023-02-23]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.

August 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.4-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.4: Security fixes](#3.9.4-security-fixes)

* An authorization/sensitive information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a fork to retain read access to an upstream repository after the fork's visibility was changed to private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and assigned [CVE-2023-23763](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23763). [Updated: 2023-09-01]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.4: Bug fixes](#3.9.4-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, scale sets configured at the enterprise level did not appear for use within the instance's organizations or repositories.
* When an administrator tried to validate blob storage connection settings for GitHub Enterprise Importer in the Management Console using the **Test storage settings** button, the operation failed.
* syslog-ng configurations for containerized services caused errors for log forwarding services. The configurations have been removed.
* When an instance exhausted available memory, in some cases, the system's out-of-memory killer (OOMK) killed the process for `dockerd`, causing Nomad to fail to recover after systemd restarted Docker.
* In some cases, when starting a new GitHub Enterprise Server instance, the preflight page indicated that there was no user disk of sufficient size attached.
* When running the ghe-migrator, certain error messages contained an invalid link to import documentation.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to mismatched values, users could not easily associate workflow job run IDs from the GitHub Enterprise Server APIs or webhooks with a job in the UI. Workflow job runs now use a new URL pattern of `...actions/runs/job/{job_id}`, and `job_id` matches values from APIs and webhook payloads.
* Administrators could not see or use the "Migrations" section in an instance's Management Console, which prevented the configuration of blob storage for GitHub Enterprise Importer. [Updated: 2023-08-31]

August 10, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.3-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.3: Security fixes](#3.9.3-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766). [Updated: 2023-09-22]
### [3.9.3: Bug fixes](#3.9.3-bugs)

* API results were incomplete, and ordering of results was incorrect if `asc` or `desc` appeared in lowercase within the API query.
* The checks in the merge box for a pull request did not always match the the checks for the most recent commit in the pull request.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer on versions 3.7 and below to migrate repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server, the system backup size would increase after running many migrations due to storage files not being cleaned up.
* A collaborator with the "Set the social preview" permission inherited from the "Read" role could not upload the social preview image of a repository.
* The security settings page for a repository would return an error when enterprise-level runners were assigned to the repository.
* GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily.
* On an instance configured to use an outbound web proxy server, an administrator could not exclude private domains in [this list](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby/blob/main/data/list.txt) from the proxy configuration. [Updated: 2023-11-27]
### [3.9.3: Changes](#3.9.3-changes)

* On GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 and above, a blob storage provider must be configured in the Management Console in order to use the GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI, "startRepositoryMigration" GraphQL API, or "Start an organization migration" REST API. The "Migrations" section in the Management Console was mistakenly removed and has been added back.
* Administrators can display all repositories in a network with `spokesctl` by using the `repositories` subcommand.
* The secondary abuse rate limits of the GraphQL API are now configurable in the Management Console. [Updated: 2023-09-01]
### [3.9.3: Known issues](#3.9.3-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]

## Enterprise Server 3.9.2

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.2](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.2/download)

July 28, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.2-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

The known issues originally published on 2023-07-28 omitted a number of known issues that still existed. The `Known issues` section below was updated on 2023-08-08.

### [3.9.2: Changes](#3.9.2-changes)

* Added a pre-upgrade check to validate the GHES version and MySQL configuration before allowing an upgrade to 3.9.
* Adjusted the timeout threshold for shutting down MySQL to prevent premature termination when upgrading to GHES 3.9.
### [3.9.2: Known issues](#3.9.2-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted. Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* The Management Console may get stuck in a loop showing "Checking requirements..." when attempting to download an update. It is safe to proceed the update process manually via the command line.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, 3.8.0, or 3.9.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* The "Migrations" section is missing from the Management Console, so it isn't possible to enable, disable, or reconfigure blob storage credentials for migrations. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if shared runner groups are configured for the enterprise, the enterprise security overview page may return a `500` error. You can avoid the issue by trying one of the following workarounds.

  + Add a runner scale set to the enterprise runner group shared with the repositories.
  + Remove access to the enterprise runner group from the affected repositories or organizations.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.1-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

The known issues originally published on 2023-07-18 omitted a number of known issues that still existed. The `Known issues` section below was updated on 2023-08-08.

### [3.9.1: Security fixes](#3.9.1-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: An attacker with write access to a repository could craft a pull request that would hide commits made in its source branch. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23764). [Updated: 2023-07-26]
* An attacker with access to the password hash of the root site administrator user for the instance's Management Console could make requests to the password API endpoint from outside of the instance.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a re-opened Pull Request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765).
### [3.9.1: Bug fixes](#3.9.1-bugs)

* If MinIO was configured for external blob storage on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and MinIO was configured for bucket replication, the instance's credential validation with MinIO would occasionally fail.
* Customers who use Azure Blob store as the remote blob provider to back GitHub Packages would have validation errors if the `EndpointSuffix` part of their Connection string was anything other than `core.windows.net`. Now all valid `EndpointSuffix` are accepted.
* When a user viewed a Jupyter notebook, GitHub Enterprise Server returned a `500` error code if the instance was configured with a self-signed TLS certificate.
* After creation of a blob object from the web UI, pre-receive hook events were missing from the instance's audit log.
* On an instance with an outbound web proxy server configured, the proxy interfered with internal operations that used `nomad alloc exec`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-balance` behaved inconsistently when displaying status or managing jobs with more than one task group.
* `.topojson` files would not render correctly, but files that conformed to the TopoJSON spec that used a `.geojson` extension would render correctly.
* On an instance configured for LDAP authentication, if the LDAP server sent an empty string for the `sshPublicKey` attribute, LDAP user sync would fail.
* REST API endpoints for managing GitHub Enterprise Server are now functional. For more information, see "[Manage GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.
* After creation of a new Management Console user, the Management Console did not display the button to copy the new users invitation.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, in some situations, Dependabot alerts were not updated when a user pushed to a repository.
* In some cases, pull requests with more than 25 rich-diff renderable files required that users toggle the diff type to correctly render the files over the 25-file limit.
* In rare circumstances, Git commits signed with SSH keys using the RSA algorithm would incorrectly indicate the signature was invalid.
* After a migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer, some repository autolink references were created with an incorrect format.
* In some cases on an instance without a GitHub Advanced Security license, Redis exceeded the maximum default memory allocation, causing `500` errors for the instance's users.
* On an instance with many organizations, the enterprise security overview page returned a `500` error.
* On an instance that was not configured to deliver email notifications using SMTP, background jobs to deliver email were enqueued unnecessarily.
* Users were unable to configure a SSH certificate authority for an organization.
* An erroneous "Blocked Copilot Repositories" link was visible in site admin pages for organizations.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a GitHub Advanced Security license, repository-level runner scale sets were not accounted for when determining whether default setup for code scanning could be used.
* Events related to repository notifications did not appear in the audit log.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, a committer would not receive an email notification for a secret scanning alert where push protections were bypassed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if a user filtered by a custom pattern on an organizations "Code & security analysis" page using an invalid query, the entire GitHub Advanced Security disappeared and an error reading "Sorry, something went wrong loading GitHub Advanced Security settings" appeared.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if a user browsed to the alerts page for secret scanning without signing in, the instance responded with a `500` error.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, output from Git for a push blocked by push protection always included an `http://` link.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, links to `http(s)://HOSTNAME/features/actions` from the web UI returned a `500` error.
* If a user added a new item to a projects roadmap view, and the item was outside of the viewport, the view would crash and display "This project failed to load".
* The audit log reported the incorrect target repository for pre-receive hook failures.
* Users can add issues and pull requests from any organization to a project, and are no longer limited to the user or organization of the project.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a GitHub Advanced Security license, enterprise-level runner scale sets with the `code-scanning` label were not sufficient to allow default setup for code scanning.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ERROR`-level "resolver failed" errors no longer appear in system logs when the instance is unable to resolve an offline fileserver. The messages are now `DEBUG`-level.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
* Code Scanning workflow runs now only request the `code-scanning` label so that they can be used with runner scale sets.
### [3.9.1: Changes](#3.9.1-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-config-check` command-line utility will return an affirmative message when no warnings or errors are detected. The affirmative message is "Configuration validation complete. No errors found."
* During initialization of a cluster configuration, output from the `ghe-cluster-config-init` command-line utility is improved and simplified.
* The API endpoint for management of the GitHub Enterprise Server instance was unavailable prior to initial configuration of the instance.
* The Management Console displays a warning about unexpected consequences that may result from modification of the instance's hostname after initial configuration.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, internal tooling to repair repositories now attempts to resolve problems within the entire repository network.
* To supplement a disaster recovery plan for a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in a cluster configuration, an administrator can configure a replica of an entire cluster in a separate datacenter, allowing the cluster to fail over to redundant nodes. For more information, see "[Configuring high availability replication for a cluster](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/configuring-high-availability-replication-for-a-cluster)."
### [3.9.1: Known issues](#3.9.1-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs.

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* The Management Console may get stuck in a loop showing "Checking requirements..." when attempting to download an update. It is safe to proceed the update process manually via the command line.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, 3.8.0, or 3.9.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

For upgrade instructions, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.0-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.0: Features](#3.9.0-features)

* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + To improve security posture and protect data from threats, enterprise owners can see user activity from the Management Console within the enterprise audit log, including events from the UI, API, and administrative SSH access. For more information, see "[Audit log events for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#management_console-category-actions)."
  + During an upgrade of an instance to a new release, people with administrative SSH access to the instance can monitor the progress of routine migrations using the `ghe-migrations` utility. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-migrations)."
  + On an instance with multiple nodes, site administrators can use the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API to monitor the health of replication. For more information, see "[Monitoring a high-availability configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability/monitoring-a-high-availability-configuration)."
  + On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can ensure a balanced distribution of jobs across nodes by using the `ghe-cluster-rebalance` utility. For more information, see "[Rebalancing cluster workloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-clustering/rebalancing-cluster-workloads)."
  + On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can proactively monitor the health of individual nodes and control the reintroduction of unhealthy nodes into the cluster using Node Eligibility Service. For more information, see "[Monitoring the health of your cluster nodes with Node Eligibility Service](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-clustering/monitoring-the-health-of-your-cluster-nodes-with-node-eligibility-service)."
* #### [Identity and access management](#identity-and-access-management)

  + On an instance configured for SAML SSO, enterprise owners can review information about the Identity Provider (IdP) configured for user authentication using the GraphQL API. The personal access token (PAT) used to authenticate requests to this API requires the `read:enterprise` scope. Previously, the PAT required the `admin:enterprise` scope. For more information, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/graphql/reference/objects#enterpriseidentityprovider)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + For an instance or organization with 2FA enabled, users can configure a 2FA method to be a preferred method. Users can also update 2FA methods from `http(s)://HOSTNAME/settings/security`. For more information, see "[Configuring two-factor authentication](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)" and "[Changing your two-factor authentication method](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/changing-your-preferred-two-factor-authentication-method)."
* #### [REST API](#rest-api)

  + To provide API integrators a smooth migration path and time to update integrations after GitHub makes occasional breaking changes, the REST API now uses calendar-based versioning. GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 provides version `2022-11-28` of the REST API. For more information, see "[API Versions](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/overview/api-versions?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Connect](#github-connect)

  + Enterprise owners who configure Server Statistics on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled will transmit usage metrics related to GitHub Actions. For more information, see "[About Server Statistics](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/analyzing-how-your-team-works-with-server-statistics/about-server-statistics#server-statistics-data-collected)."
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + To more easily discover potential security or quality issues in code, users can configure code scanning directly through the web interface without adding a GitHub Actions workflow to the repository. This feature finds and sets up the best CodeQL configuration for the repository, detecting supported languages and enabling CodeQL analysis for every pull request and every push to the default branch and any protected branches. Analysis of JavaScript (including TypeScript), Python, and Ruby code, are currently supported. For more information, see "[Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically)."
  + To simplify the configuration of code scanning, organization owners can enable code scanning for all eligible repositories in an organization using a default configuration, either via the web interface or REST API. For more information, see "[Configuring default setup for code scanning at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale)" and "[REST API endpoints for organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/orgs/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#enable-or-disable-a-security-feature-for-an-organization)" in the REST API documentation.
  + To ensure that relevant alerts remain visible and actionable, users can manually remove stale alerts from code scanning. For more information, see "[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#removing-stale-configurations-and-alerts-from-a-branch)."
  + To better understand the status of CodeQL and other code scanning tools for a repository, and to help troubleshoot, users can review the tool status page. For more information, see "[About the tool status page for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page)."
  + To customize the behavior of code scanning on a per-repository basis, repository administrators can configure what severity levels for code scanning alerts will cause checks in a pull request to fail. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests#code-scanning-results-check-failures)."
  + To protect repositories from pushes that contain custom secret scanning patterns defined at the enterprise, organization, or repository level, users can enable push protection for those patterns. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
  + Organization owners can view the enablement status of security features for the organization's repositories using the REST API. The endpoint provides details for GitHub Advanced Security, secret scanning, and push protection. For more information, see "[Repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-organization-repositories)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Repository administrators can programmatically enable code scanning with a default CodeQL configuration using the REST API. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically)"
    - "[Get the code scanning default setup configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/code-scanning#get-a-code-scanning-default-setup-configuration)" in the Code Scanning REST API documentation
    - "[Update the code scanning default setup configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/code-scanning#update-a-code-scanning-default-setup-configuration)" in the Code Scanning REST API documentation
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + To improve the security of GitHub Actions workflows that pin references, Dependabot can update the versioning for calls to reusable workflows within workflow files. For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)."
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions and the dependency graph enabled, as well as automatic access to GitHub.com actions using GitHub Connect, the web interface will suggest submission actions within a repository with supported languages. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Using the dependency submission API](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)"
    - "[About GitHub Actions for enterprises](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/about-github-actions-for-enterprises)"

    For repositories that use a language that has a submission action, when users with write access visit their dependency graph (this page), we will show them a prompt that directs them to the Marketplace to find an action that would help them.
  + To improve the security of projects that use npm v9, the dependency graph and Dependabot can parse and update `package-lock.json` files that specify `lockfileVersion: 3`. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)," "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)," and [`lockfileVersion`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json#lockfileversion) in the npm documentation.
  + To improve the security of Gradle projects, the dependency graph and Dependabot can parse and update Gradle version catalogs in `settings.gradle`. For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)" and [Sharing dependency versions between projects](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) in the Gradle User Manual.
  + To ensure that users receive the most relevant and actionable alerts about dependency updates, repository administrators and organization owners can enable or disable Dependabot alerts for an individual repository or organization. For more information, see "[Quickstart for securing your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-repository#managing-dependabot-alerts)" or "[Quickstart for securing your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-organization#managing-dependabot-alerts-and-the-dependency-graph)."
  + If people with access to a repository do not interact with Dependabot security updates for over 90 days, Dependabot will pause automated pull request activity. For more information, see "[About Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-automatic-deactivation-of-dependabot-updates)."
  + To help users evaluate the stability risk of a dependency update, Dependabot can fetch release notes, changelogs, and commit history in pull requests that update Docker dependencies. For more information, see "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#docker)."
  + To assist with software security and supply chain risk management, people with read access to a repository can export a software bill of materials (SBOM) for a repository's dependency graph using the web interface or REST API. The SBOM adheres to the SPDX 2.3 specification. For more information, see "[Using the dependency submission API](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api#generating-and-submitting-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom)," "[Exporting a software bill of materials for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exporting-a-software-bill-of-materials-for-your-repository)," and [The Software Package Data Exchange® (SPDX®) Specification Version 2.3](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/) on the SPDX website.
  + The dependency graph can parse Python dependencies for `pyproject.toml` files that follow the PEP 621 standard. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)" and [PEP 621 – Storing project metadata in pyproject.toml](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) in the Index of Python Enhancement Proposals.
  + Users can use the GraphQL API to review dependencies submitted using the dependency submission API. For more information, see "[Schema previews](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/graphql/overview/schema-previews#access-to-a-repositorys-dependency-graph-preview)."
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.303.0. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.303.0) on GitHub.com. If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release. [Updated: 2024-04-25]
  + On instances in a cluster configuration, GitHub Actions is available as a private beta. Beta features are subject to change. For more information, and to enroll in the beta, [contact your representative on GitHub's Sales team](https://github.com/enterprise/contact).
  + Administrators of self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions can configure auto-scaling runners using Actions Runner Controller and runner scale sets. For more information, see "[About Actions Runner Controller](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/about-actions-runner-controller)."
  + Administrators can bypass all protection rules for a given environment and force the pending jobs referencing the environment to proceed. For more information, see "[Using environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#allow-administrators-to-bypass-configured-protection-rules)."
  + Users who deploy with OIDC can define more advanced access policies by including additional custom claims within a token. To help uniquely verify the source of a workflow job, include the following claims.

    - `actor_id`
    - `repository_id`
    - `repository_owner_id`
    - `workflow_ref`
    - `workflow_sha`
    - `job_workflow_sha`

    For more information, see [Security hardening your deployments](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments).
  + To improve security for workflows that use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the following defaults apply to new organizations and repositories.

    - New organizations that users create inherit permissions from the instance's enterprise-level configuration. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions)."

For more information, see "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions)."
  + To allow workflow authors to pin a required workflow file to a fully validated version, required workflows can be referenced using any branch, tag, or commit SHA from the repository containing the workflow file. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#configuring-a-required-workflow-for-your-organization)."
  + To enforce required workflows throughout an organization, GitHub Enterprise Server blocks direct pushes to branches where required workflows are enforced. To allow direct pushes for a particular repository, remove the repository as a target for the required workflow. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#configuring-a-required-workflow-for-your-organization)."
  + To improve performance for workflows that build Go, caching is enabled by default when using the `setup-go` action. For more information, see "[Building and testing Go](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-go#caching-dependencies)."
* #### [Organizations](#organizations)

  + To allow the management of branch protection rules without granting admin access, organization owners can create a custom role with the "Edit repository rules" permission. For more information, see "[Managing custom repository roles for an organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization)."
  + Users of the REST API can programmatically create and update least-privilege roles for repositories using the Custom Repository Roles REST API. The API is generally available, with a breaking change to the API's endpoint paths. Previously, the API was accessible at `/orgs/{org}/custom_roles`, and is now accessible at `/orgs/{org}/custom-repository-roles`. The [List custom repository roles in an organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/orgs/custom-roles#list-custom-repository-roles-in-an-organization) will no longer be available in the next version of the REST API. For more information, see "[About custom repository roles](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/about-custom-repository-roles)" and "[REST API endpoints for custom repository roles](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/orgs/custom-roles?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.

  + `now` is now `Timestamp`.
  + Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
  + Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)."

  For a full list of field mappings, download the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv). This change is part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and additional field names will change in upcoming releases.
* On a configured instance, the name for the HAProxy service is now `haproxy-frontend`. Previously, the name was `haproxy`. Additionally, on an unconfigured instance, there is a new service named `haproxy-pre-config`. If your instance forwards logs to an external system, update your rules to reflect these changes. For more information, see "[Log forwarding](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/exploring-user-activity/log-forwarding)" article
* For an instance or organization with 2FA enabled, when a user sets up 2FA, GitHub Enterprise Server suggests an authenticator app (TOTP) by default.
* When a person with administrative SSH access to an instance submits a support bundle using either the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utility, a period for log collection specified with the `-p` or `--period` no longer requires quotes to enclose the date value. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-support-bundle)."
* To provide additional context within the web interface on an instance where Dependabot alerts are enabled, links to Dependabot alerts in an issue or pull request comment display an improved label and hovercard with alert details.
* On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, people with write or maintain access to a repository can view or act on Dependabot alerts by default. Custom roles, the security manager role, organization permissions, and notification settings are not affected.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and GitHub Connect enabled for the synchronization of actions from GitHub.com, CodeQL code scanning is up to 16% faster. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning for your appliance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-github-connect-to-sync-github-actions)."
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and email configured for notifications, users can receive notifications for secret scanning alerts by watching a repository and choosing "All activity" or "Security alerts". To continue receiving notifications for secret scanning alerts in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later, users must enable email notifications in the web interface at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/settings/notifications` under "Watching" by choosing "Email".
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, secret scanning alerts display whether detected tokens from GitHub are valid.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the enterprise and organization audit logs now display an event when an owner enables or disables a push protection for a custom pattern for a repository, organization, or the enterprise. For more information, see "[Reviewing the audit log for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#org-category-actions)" and "[Audit log events for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#business_secret_scanning_push_protection-category-actions)."
* Users can filter the lists of alerts for Dependabot, code scanning, and secret scanning by repository topic or team in the security overview for an organization. For more information, see "[Filtering alerts in security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/security-overview/filtering-alerts-in-security-overview)."
* In the security overview for an organization, the following improvements apply to the "Security coverage" view during feature enablement.

  + To provide insight into the number of GitHub Advanced Security licenses used, active committers for the repository are visible. For repositories where GitHub Advanced Security is not enabled, the number indicates the number of licenses required to enable the feature.
  + Unsaved changes are now labeled with a "Modified" tag, and the "Save security settings" button now displays the total number of changes to save.
  + While a security feature is being enabled, the "Security coverage" view shows a status of "Updating..." to inform you of the ongoing process.

  For more information, see "[About security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/security-overview/about-security-overview)."
* In the security overview's "Security risk" and "Security coverage" views, when a user selects a team from the "Team" drop-down or filters by team, results appear for repositories where the team has write or administrative access or has been granted access to security alerts. Previously, users could only view results for repositories where the team had administrative access or had been granted access to security alerts.
* To provide more context within a project, users can share a deep link to a specific issue in a project to have the issue open in the project's side panel.
* Organization owners can create up to five custom repository roles. Previously, the limit was three. For more information, see "[About custom repository roles](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/about-custom-repository-roles)."
* When transferring a repository, users can also rename the repository. For more information, see "[Transferring a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository)."
* If a user archives a repository, responses from the GraphQL API that include information about the repository now include an `archivedAt` value with a timestamp representing the archival date.
### [3.9.0: Backups](#3.9.0-backups)

* Before beginning a backup with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.0 and later, the `ghe-host-check` utility will now perform a preflight check on the backup host to confirm the software version and disk space requirements. For more information, see the [3.9.0 release](https://github.com/github/backup-utils/releases/tag/v3.9.0) in the `github/backup-utils` repository on GitHub.com.
* GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.0 allows administrators to view the progress of backup and restoration operations on the backup host using the `ghe-backup-progress` utility. For more information, see "[Configuring backups on your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance#monitoring-backup-or-restoration-progress)."
### [3.9.0: Known issues](#3.9.0-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* The Management Console may get stuck in a loop showing "Checking requirements..." when attempting to download an update. It is safe to proceed the update process manually via the command line.
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, 3.8.0, or 3.9.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* After upgrading an existing instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API is unavailable. To enable the API, SSH into the instance and run the following commands.

  Shell
  ```
  sudo mkdir -p /data/ghes-manage-gateway/current
  sudo chown -R ghes-manage-gateway:ghes-manage-gateway /data/ghes-manage-gateway/current
  sudo systemctl restart ghes-manage-gateway ghes-manage-gateway-consul

  ```
  ```
  sudo mkdir -p /data/ghes-manage-gateway/current
  sudo chown -R ghes-manage-gateway:ghes-manage-gateway /data/ghes-manage-gateway/current
  sudo systemctl restart ghes-manage-gateway ghes-manage-gateway-consul

  ```

  For more information about the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API, see "[Manage GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes?apiVersion=2022-11-28)." [Updated: 2023-06-22]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if shared runner groups are configured for the enterprise, the enterprise security overview page may return a `500` error. You can avoid the issue by trying one of the following workarounds.

  + Add a runner scale set to the enterprise runner group shared with the repositories.
  + Remove access to the enterprise runner group from the affected repositories or organizations.

  [Updated: 2023-09-05]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes. [Updated: 2023-09-21]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, ephemeral self-hosted runners do not automatically update to the latest version. Users will need to manually update the runners to the latest version. [Updated: 2023-09-29]
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion. If you observe memory exhaustion on your instance and see a high metric for `resource_activity`, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-10-10]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-12-04]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.9.0: Deprecations](#3.9.0-deprecations)

* #### [Change to command-line utility for management of replication](#change-to-command-line-utility-for-management-of-replication)

  + On an instance with multiple nodes, people with administrative SSH access to the instance should use `ghe-spokesctl` for management of Git replication instead of `ghe-spokes`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-spokesctl)."
* #### [Dependency graph no longer ingests go.sum files](#dependency-graph-no-longer-ingests-gosum-files)

  + Because `go.sum` files are not lock files and may result in false positive Dependabot alerts, on an instance with the dependency graph enabled, the `go.sum` files are no longer ingested for users' Go repositories. If Dependabot alerts are enabled, Dependabot will no longer alert users for vulnerabilities in a `go.sum` file's dependencies. The dependency graph continues to support `go.mod` files, the recommended format for Go projects. Use Go 1.17 or higher to ensure your `go.mod` file contains a comprehensive view of all direct and transitive dependencies. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."
* #### [Only GitHub Actions can publish a GitHub Pages site if source includes symbolic links](#only-github-actions-can-publish-a-github-pages-site-if-source-includes-symbolic-links)

  + To improve the security of an instance where users deploy sites using GitHub Pages, sites that contain symbolic links will no longer build outside of GitHub Actions. If a user's site is affected and a site administrator has configured email for the instance, the user will receive an email with instructions about how to fix the error. To continue using symbolic links in the site's source, the instance must be configured for GitHub Actions, and the user must write a GitHub Actions workflow to use as a publishing source. For more information, see "[About GitHub Pages](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)."
### [3.9.0: Errata](#3.9.0-errata)

* Previously, these release notes indiciated that organization owners could enable the display of organization members' IP addresses in audit log events. Audit logs for GitHub Enterprise Server always include IP addresses. [Updated: 2024-03-28]

## Enterprise Server 3.11.19

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.19](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.19/download)

December 17, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.19: Security fixes](#3.11.19-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.19: Bug fixes](#3.11.19-bugs)

* The audit log cluster rebalance script incorrectly proceeded before all shards were ready. This caused the script to exit before the necessary data was available, potentially leading to issues with the audit log migration.
* For instances hosted on Azure, if a pre-upgrade check failed due to insufficient user disk size, the Management Console displayed an internal server error.
* Pull request synchronization—the process keeping pull requests up to date with the latest commits to a branch—sometimes failed to retry if the initial synchronization process failed.
* When creating a pre-receive hook environment, attempts to include an image URL over 255 characters failed with a database error. The maximum length is still 255 characters, but the URL length is now validated before the process starts.
* Performing a browser back navigation to a pull request now displays up-to-date status checks.
* Subversion services were non-functional in some cases.
### [3.11.19: Changes](#3.11.19-changes)

* Pull request merges are handled more efficiently, allowing more Git objects to be created before timeout. Additionally, loose objects created by merges that time out are now discarded, limiting the accumulation of these objects.
### [3.11.19: Known issues](#3.11.19-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* The `reply.[hostname]` subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**. When regenerating the certificates with management console, the `subdomain reply.[hostname]` is missing from the ssl certification.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Some customers upgrading from 3.11.x or 3.12.x may experience a bug with the feature "Automatic update checks", filling the root disk with logs causing a system degradation. To prevent this, you can turn off the feature [Enable automatic update check](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/upgrading-your-instance/preparing-to-upgrade/enabling-automatic-update-checks#enabling-automatic-update-checks) in the management console.

## Enterprise Server 3.11.17

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.17](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.17/download)

November 07, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.17: Security fixes](#3.11.17-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This is a follow up fix for [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487) to further harden the encrypted assertions feature against this type of attack. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document to exploit this vulnerability.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with Enterprise Administrator access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance could escalate privileges to SSH root access. This is achieved by exploiting the pre-receive hook environment to bypass symlink checks in the `ghe-firejail` path and execute malicious scripts. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-10007](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-10007) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.11.17: Bug fixes](#3.11.17-bugs)

* This error message `mbind: Operation not permitted` was repeatedly showing in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` MySQL logs.
* When saving settings in the Management Console, the configuration run would stop if the `enterprise-manage` process was restarted.
* A missing configuration value prevented Dependabot from creating group update pull requests.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* The initial setup certificate generation in AWS took longer than expected due to fallback to private IPs. The time for this fallback has been reduced.
* If the primary instance was unreachable, running `ghe-repl-stop --force` on a replica would fail during the config apply run.
* When restoring from a backup, repositories that had been deleted in the last 90 days were not completely restored.
* Restoring Git repositories using `backup-utils` occasionally failed.
* Some customers upgrading from 3.11 to 3.13 may experience issues with undecryptable records during the upgrade. This issue has now been resolved. We recommend you read [Undecryptable records](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/upgrading-your-instance/troubleshooting-upgrades/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#undecryptable-records).
### [3.11.17: Changes](#3.11.17-changes)

* For instances deployed on AWS, the default settings for Chrony NTP synchronization have been aligned with AWS's suggested default configurations.
### [3.11.17: Known issues](#3.11.17-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time.

## Enterprise Server 3.11.16

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.16](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.16/download)

October 10, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.16: Security fixes](#3.11.16-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Malicious URLs for SVG assets provided information about a victim user who clicked the URL, allowing an attacker to retrieve metadata belonging to the user and use it to generate a convincing phishing page. This required the attacker to upload malicious SVGs and phish a victim user to click the URL for the uploaded asset. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9539](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9539). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This was a regression introduced as part of follow-up remediation from [CVE-2024-4985](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4985), which resulted in a new variant of the vulnerability. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
### [3.11.16: Bug fixes](#3.11.16-bugs)

* HAProxy reloading was failure prone, which could lead to failed Git operations. This reloading process has been replaced with a more resilient Systemd process.
* An unhandled nil value when configuring Actions storage with AWS S3 via OIDC configuration in the terminal could cause an error.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, the custom pattern page would not load because dry run results were tied to a deleted repository.
* The "List teams" API endpoint returned duplicate results when paginating.
* A model with no URL could cause a `ghe-migrator` import to fail.
* Restore could fail when restoring MySQL using backup-utils.
### [3.11.16: Changes](#3.11.16-changes)

* Pre-receive hook environments can use the `clone3()` system call.
* The creation, deletion, or change in visibility of a gist has been added to the audit log.
### [3.11.16: Known issues](#3.11.16-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* The `reply.[hostname]` subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
* The admin stats REST API endpoints may time out on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
## Enterprise Server 3.11.15

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.15](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.15/download)

September 23, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.15: Security fixes](#3.11.15-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could steal sensitive information by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the repository transfer feature. This exploitation would require social engineering. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8770](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8770) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could push a commit with changes to a workflow using a PAT or OAuth app that lacks the appropriate `workflow` scope by pushing a triple-nested tag pointing at the associated commit. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8263](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8263) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** A GitHub App installed in organizations could upgrade some permissions from read to write access without approval from an organization administrator. An attacker would require an account with administrator access to install a malicious GitHub App. GitHub has requested [CVE ID CVE-2024-8810](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8810) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.11.15: Bug fixes](#3.11.15-bugs)

* For instances deployed on AWS with IMDSv2 enforced, fallback to private IPs was not successful.
* A config apply run may not have been properly applied due to calls being made to Nomad before it was ready to accept connections. When this occurred, the `Error querying agent info: failed querying self endpoint: Get "http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/agent/self"` error was written to the `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log` file.
* `ghe-storage-find` was sometimes unable to identify a data disk.
* After upgrading the relevant GHES version, the `resolvconf` service failed to start due to a missing directory.
* When configuring a high availability replica and during the database seeding of a MySQL replica node, restarting the nomad service could time out. Consequently, when MySQL replication attempted to start an error was reported, and setting up replication failed.
* Placing Nomad jobs would not allow retries in cases when Nomad wasn't available yet.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-status` command returned an error if a soft-deleted repository had a checksum mismatch.
* Some repositories could miss spokes information after restoring in a clustering topology due to unrescued exceptions.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
* The `CommandPalette` component no longer displays repository information on `404` pages, preventing the leakage of private repository information for users without access.
* Custom links to other repositories displayed incorrect breadcrumbs.
* When a GitHub App installation had all repositories installed individually, it was not possible to remove the repositories from the selection.
* Some custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering. You may want to edit and republish your custom patterns. You can manually republish custom patterns with the following command: `ghe-secret-scanning jobs queue custom-patterns republish --custom-pattern-id=?`. Outdated alerts caused by edits during custom pattern backfills have been fixed in version 3.13 and above.
### [3.11.15: Changes](#3.11.15-changes)

* For instances deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), site administrators can configure regional AWS STS endpoints for OIDC from the Management Console.
### [3.11.15: Known issues](#3.11.15-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as `127.0.0.1`.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS.

  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations.

## Enterprise Server 3.11.14

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.14](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.14/download)

August 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.14: Features](#3.11.14-features)

* Users can view the app state of gists, networks, and wikis in the `spokesctl info` output, enhancing visibility into the status of these elements. Additionally, `spokesctl check` can diagnose and, in most cases, fix empty repository networks, improving network management.
### [3.11.14: Security fixes](#3.11.14-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL:** On GitHub Enterprise Server instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with specific IdPs utilizing publicly exposed signed federation metadata XML, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user account with site administrator privileges. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6800](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6800) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could update the `title`, `assignees`, and `labels` of any issue inside a public repository. This was only exploitable inside a public repository, and private/internal repositories were not affected. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-7711](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-7711) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the issue contents from a private repository using a GitHub App with only `contents: read` and `pull requests: write` permissions. This was only exploitable via user access token, and installation access tokens were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6337](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6337) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.14: Bug fixes](#3.11.14-bugs)

* During hotpatching and sometimes when applying configuration changes, a configuration run to upgrade the GitHub Actions service was unnecessarily triggered. The GitHub Actions service will only be upgraded in GitHub Enterprise Server feature releases.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during a hotpatch upgrade, a race condition could block various upgrade activities.
* The `ghe-config-apply` process made an unnecessary number of connections to Redis.
* Restarting the `resolvconf` service would not correctly update the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf`.
* Instances installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) could have their hostname overwritten by GCP when a hotpatch was applied.
* The minimum password requirements for Management Console users and the root site administrator required an upper case character when providing a password with a minimum of 8 characters, contradicting the documentation and password hint.
* The `ghe-migrations` utility for visualizing migrations did not work due to a regression. Administrators can now run `ghe-migrations` to view the progress and status of `github` migrations, or run `ghe-migrations --all` to view progress on all services.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, configuration runs created subdomains for ChatOps services, such as `slack.HOSTNAME` and `teams.HOSTNAME`, regardless of whether the service was enabled.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
* Site administrators could not switch maintenance mode directly from "scheduled" to "on," or vice versa.
* Some users were unable to delete project views.
* When importing using `ghe-migrator`, team URLs containing dots were imported as-is, leading to 404s when attempting to view the imported teams. Dots in imported team URLs are now escaped to dashes.
* Due to a regression introduced in a previous patch, for enterprises that use encrypted SAML assertions, SSO attempts failed with a digest mismatch error if the entire SAML response was signed, rather than just the assertions.
* Running `go get` for a Golang repository with a directory structure that overlaps with GitHub UI routes failed
* The `github-stream-processor` service could get into a state where it would continually fail to process messages with a `TRILOGY_CLOSED_CONNECTION` error.
* The wrong help link was displayed when push protection blocked a secret from the CLI.
* For repositories with issues disabled, issue links were redirected to pull requests.
* In custom pre-receive hooks, the paths stored in environment variables that allow for newly pushed objects to be in a quarantine directory could be incorrectly interpreted as relative to a worktree instead of the Git directory, causing certain commands to fail to read from the repository. The variables now use absolute paths.
* A corrupted entry in the Git audit log could cause out of memory errors.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
### [3.11.14: Changes](#3.11.14-changes)

* Actions KPI logs are disabled by default to reduce log size.
* Users can set their styling preference for link underlines in the web interface, on their "Accessibility" settings page.
* Audit log events related to audit log streaming are available in the enterprise audit log page, and via audit log streaming.
### [3.11.14: Known issues](#3.11.14-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* The `reply.HOSTNAME` subdomain is falsely displayed as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via the Management Console without subdomain isolation.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* On boot, the `resolvconf` service may fail to start because the `/run/resolvconf` directory does not exist when the service attempts to `touch` a file there, with the error:

  ```
  /bin/touch: cannot touch '/run/resolvconf/postponed-update': No such file or directory

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue with the following commands — this change will persist on reboots, but not upgrades:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak \
  '/\[Service\]/a ExecStartPre\=\/bin\/mkdir \-p \/run\/resolvconf' \
  /etc/systemd/system/resolvconf.service.d/local.conf

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl start resolvconf

  ```

  [Updated: 2024-08-26]
### [3.11.14: Errata](#3.11.14-errata)

* These release notes previously indicated as a known issue that on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.14 when log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
  The fix for this problem was already included in GitHub Enterprise Server [3.11.13](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes#3.11.13-bugs). [Updated: 2024-09-16]
## Enterprise Server 3.11.13

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.13](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.13/download)

July 19, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

Due to a bug that caused hotpatch upgrades to fail for instances on Microsoft Azure, the previous patch release in this series (**3.11.12**) is not available for download. The following release notes include the updates introduced in that release.

### [3.11.13: Security fixes](#3.11.13-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could cause unbounded resource exhaustion on the instance by sending a large payload to the Git server. To mitigate this issue, GitHub has limited the count of "have" and "want" lines for Git read operations. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5795](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5795) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An improper privilege management vulnerability allowed users to migrate private repositories without having appropriate scopes defined on the related personal access token. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5566](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5566) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized access in a public repository using a suspended GitHub App via a scoped user access token. This was only exploitable in public repositories while private repositories were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5816](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5816) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could execute a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to perform write operations on a victim-owned repository in GitHub Enterprise Server by exploiting incorrect request types. A mitigating factor is that the attacker has to be a trusted user and the victim has to visit a tag in the attacker's fork of their own repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5815) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the name of a private repository on the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance when the private repository has a deploy key associated to it. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6395](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6395) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **LOW:** Instance administrators could see fine-grained personal access tokens in plaintext in the babeld and gitauth logs.
* **LOW:** An attacker with read access to a project could use the REST API to view a list of all members in an organization, including members who had made their membership private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **LOW:** An attacker could include MathJax syntax in Markdown to bypass GitHubs normal restrictions on CSS properties in Markdown. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose sensitive information from a private repository exploiting organization ruleset features. This attack required an organization member to explicitly change the visibility of a dependent repository from private to public. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6336](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6336) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized read access to issue content inside an internal repository via GitHub projects. This attack required attacker access to the corresponding project board. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5817](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5817) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.13: Bug fixes](#3.11.13-bugs)

* When an instance hosted on Azure was upgraded with a hotpatch, the upgrade failed with an `rsync` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, remote blob storage could fill up with large amounts of data because cleanup jobs were skipped on old hosts.
* The threshold set by `server_rejoin_age_max` for single-node GHES deployments was too low.
* In some cases, commands run in an administrative SSH shell were not written to the audit log.
* When an administrator submitted support data to GitHub Support, spokesd keys were incorrectly sanitized.
* When log forwarding was enabled, some specific service logs, including babeld, gitauth, unicorn, and resqued, were duplicated.
* During the initial boot of an instance, a data disk attached as `/dev/sdb` may not have been recognized as an available disk.
* In a high availablity configuration, running `ghe-repl-node` multiple times from a node that did not have replication running had the potential to overwrite the configuration on the primary node.
* Configuration history is only generated for instances in a cluster, high availability (HA) cluster, or standalone HA configuration. The current node must be a primary or replica node with replication running.
* In some cases, the HAProxy `kill_timeout` setting caused service outages during upgrades or large transactions.
* The `ssh-audit-log.sh` script did not effectively log SSH commands, and the `ghe-sanitize-log.psed` script inadequately sanitized password-related logs.
* The default MSSQL timeout of 8 seconds sometimes caused issues during administrator activities. The default timeout has been increased to 30 seconds.
* For an instance running on Microsoft Azure, the user disk service failed to start because the attached volume could not be found.
* Establishing a new GitHub Connect connection could fail with a 500 error.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to migrate a repository, the links for pull requests merge commits were not imported.
* When a user used the REST API endpoints that returned secret scanning alerts at the repository or organization level with non-cursor-based pagination (for example, without `before` or `after` query parameters), the REST API endpoints for secret scanning returned incorrect `Link` headers.
* On certain branch names, the branch info bar was causing frozen string errors.
* On instances with SAML authentication configured, users were unable to sign out and became stuck in an infinite SAML SSO loop.
* On instances with SCIM enabled, the administrator was unable to view users without an external identity record (for example, because they were provisioned before SCIM was enabled on the instance) in stafftools.
* On instances enrolled in the SCIM private beta, built-in authentication users can be added to organizations and teams. Organization owners will no longer see the misleading message that the organization membership is managed by the SAML identity provider when updating organization memberships.
* Enterprise owners managed by an identity provider were asked to authenticate within GitHub when performing privileged actions.
* On an instance that restricts emails to verified domains, secret scanning emails would sometimes be sent to an unverified domain.
* In some cases, on the "Files" tab of a pull request, a comment on the first line did not render.
* Some organizations were not recognized as part of an instance's enterprise account.
* Some users would encounter an error when navigating to their personal security settings page at `https://HOSTNAME/settings/security`.
* The `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` could not initialize in some cases, resulting in an exception when handling the error.
* On the "Code scanning" page of a repository, the branch filter did not correctly display all branches.
* When including a `.gitignore` or `README.md` file on repository creation failed due to a ruleset or pre-receive hook, no error message displayed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, requests to the `/enterprises/{enterprise}/settings/billing/advanced-security` REST API endpoint could fail due to timeout.
* Users viewing the alerts index page experienced inconsistencies in rendering the closed alert state.
* Organizations named "C" were incorrectly routed to the GitHub Enterprise Server contact page instead of their organization page.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, commits made by users who do not belong to an organization were not counted.
* When servers responded with unsupported characters, webhook deliveries were not displayed in the UI.
* Chat integrations required frequent reauthentication, as a result of new app installations overwriting previous ones.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command did not select the correct Nomad container when running a command within a Git repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, disabling and re-enabling GitHub Advanced Security for an organization resulted in redundant scans of some repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, contributions were not tracked on public repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the "adjust configuration" step failed when enabling code scanning with the default setup on self-hosted Windows runners.
* Migration of the `issue_edits` table caused intermittent failures during the upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11, resulting in the error message `ActiveRecord::ConcurrentMigrationError: Failed to release advisory lock.` [Updated: 2024-08-14]
### [3.11.13: Changes](#3.11.13-changes)

* In a high availability configuration, users can only run `ghe-config-apply` or `ghe-cluster-config-apply` on a replica node if replication is already running (from `ghe-repl-start`). If replication isnt running on the node, the user will be instructed to start replication.
* Configuration history has been extended. When `ghe-config-apply`, `ghe-cluster-config-apply`, or `ghe-config-archive` is run: `secrets.conf` is captured, a sha256sum for each of the current configuration files is included, the existing patch that is generated includes `secrets.conf`, and an additional sanitized patch that excludes `secrets.conf` is also generated.
* The timeout for requests made to the REST API endpoints for secret scanning has been extended.
* A more specific error message is shown when a non-provisioned user tried to sign in to an instance with SCIM enabled.
* When a user changes a repository's visibility to public, the user is now warned that previous Actions history and logs will become public as well.
* A more specific error message is shown when a deprovisioned user attempts signing into an instance with SCIM enabled.
* In the audit logs, administrators can see more context for failed user authentication attempts using LDAP.
* The system logs provide more context for authentication failures related to multi-factor authentication.
* When using the `ghe-webhook-logs` utility, webhook delivery logs can be filtered by event and action. Users can use `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues` to filter by event, or `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues.opened` to filter by event and action.
* To avoid excessive log volume and associated disk pressure, requests for `GetCacheKey` are no longer logged. Previously, the high frequency of these requests caused significant log accumulation.
### [3.11.13: Known issues](#3.11.13-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
* *Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.*
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.

* For an instance in a cluster configuration, during the migration phase of a configuration run, the process of copying configuration updates to all nodes would fail.
* An LDAP-related error message was incorrectly displayed at the enterprise and organization levels.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, a misconfiguration caused jobs to be added to the `hydro_update_rule_override_for_repository_visibility_change_event` queue but not processed.
* An incorrect job queue mapping caused the `hydro_advanced_security_archived_status_changed` queue to constantly grow.
* External collaborators with read-only access were able to run workflows on their pull requests from private forks without approval.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering.
### [3.11.9: Changes](#3.11.9-changes)

* To aid in understanding the CPU/memory utilization of secret scanning processes, the binary names of nomad workers were updated to differentiate between the different types of secret scanning jobs.
* A more specific error message is shown when the `ghe-repl-node` command is run on an instance not configured for high availability.
* The SCIM private beta has resumed with support from GitHub engineering in GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11 and later. Site administrators can provision users and groups on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance automatically with SCIM. SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server is in private beta and subject to change.

### [3.11.8: Security fixes](#3.11.8-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with the editor role in the Management Console could gain administrative SSH access to the appliance by command injection when configuring the chat integration. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-3646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). The editor role has been deprecated. For more information, see the "Changes" section of these release notes.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring Artifact & Logs and Migrations Storage. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3684](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3684) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker with a deploy key for an organization-owned repository could bypass a ruleset that specified organization administrators as bypass actors. Exploitation would require an attacker to already have access to a valid deploy key for a repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3470](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3470) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a detached repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions while the repository is detached. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2440](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2440) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* A GraphQL endpoint was disabled as part of a previous security fix, causing projects auto-add workflow and inline issue creation errors. To resolve these errors, a security patch was applied that allows for the affected GraphQL endpoint to be re-enabled.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.8: Bug fixes](#3.11.8-bugs)

* When configuring audit log streaming to Datadog or Splunk on an instance with custom CA certificates, the connection failed with the error `There was an error trying to connect`.
* Disk usage, utilization, and latency for data devices could render incorrectly in Grafana.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability replication enabled, Git operations for existing repositories would fail after failover to the replica cluster.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, former primary nodes were able to access the newly promoted nodes after failover. The `ghe-cluster-failover` command has been updated to block access from the old cluster, and four new command-line utilities have been introduced to manually block IP addresses: `ghe-cluster-block-ips`, `ghe-cluster-block-ip`, `ghe-cluster-unblock-ips`, and `ghe-cluster-unblock-ip`. For more information, see [Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-failover).

* A Redis job had a memory limit that was too low in some cases, leading the process to run out of memory.
* The `ghe-update-check` command did not clean up .tmp files in `/var/lib/ghe-updates/`, which could lead to full disk issues.
* On an instance that failed a configuration run, when attempting to repeat the restore step of a backup, the audit log restore step returned error lines even though audit logs were being fully restored.
* In some cases, Treelights timeouts caused pull requests to return a 500 error.
* Some search indices in Stafftools failed to load.
* The web UI presented inapplicable fine-grained permissions for assignment to custom repository roles. The permissions were also displayed as implicitly included in certain base roles.
* Unauthenticated requests to the REST APIs `/search/code` endpoint returned erroneous rate-limit values.
* The profile settings for organizations displayed a warning about profile images that does not apply to organizations on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* On some pages that listed users on an instance, the web UI erroneously rendered checkboxes to the right of users details.
* Administrators could get a 500 error when trying to access the "File storage" section of the site admin dashboard.
* Setting a maintenance message failed if the message contained a multibyte character.
* On an instance where user avatars had been deleted directly from the database, an identicon avatar was not correctly displayed for affected users, and administrators may have observed a relatively high number of application exceptions.
* On an instance with repository caching configured, adding new repositories to a cache node sometimes failed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, after enabling secret scanning for the first time for an organization or the instance, the historical backfills for alerts in existing repositories issues did not appear.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, metrics for custom patterns alerts incorrectly included tokens in ignored locations.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, on the tool status page for code scanning, outdated upload errors were still displayed after a successful upload.
### [3.11.8: Changes](#3.11.8-changes)

* On an instance hosted on Azure, administrators can set and reset SSH keys and passwords via the Azure Agent.
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated. For details, see the "Security fixes" section of these release notes. Existing users with the editor role will be unable to log in to the Management Console, and should contact their site administrator requesting that access be reinstated by updating the user to the operator role if appropriate.
### [3.11.8: Known issues](#3.11.8-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.7: Bug fixes](#3.11.7-bugs)

* In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
* Administrators could initiate an SSH audit that unknowingly unverified all SSH keys.
* Attributes used to debug LDAP issues were not included in system logs.
* On an instance in a high availability or cluster configuration, configuring `fluent-bit` on a primary node returned an empty `primary_host` value.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with many nodes, requests to the REST API for managing GitHub Enterprise Server would exceed the instances HTTP timeouts.
* Redundant messages caused an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, the `ghe-spokesctl` command failed when run on a replica node.
* If an administrator lost SSH access to an instance, authentication from the hypervisor console using the password for the root site administrator would fail.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`

* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some searches for secret scanning alerts resulted in a `500` error.
* When an administrator set a policy to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for an enterprise, a message incorrectly indicated that users without 2FA enabled on their account would be removed from the enterprise. These users will be removed from repositories and organizations in the enterprise, but not from the enterprise itself.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
* When using GitHub Enterprise Importer to import repositories, `ghost` users in archive metadata files would cause an error when generating a list of migration conflicts using `ghe-migrator conflicts`.
* After an administrator ran `ghe-saml-mapping-csv`, the output did not include the corresponding SQL query.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the security overview did not display updated alert counts for code scanning immediately after the completion of analysis.
* During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, rebuilds of GitHub Pages sites failed if no replicas of the GitHub Pages data were available (for example, on a newly restored cluster).
* In some cases, manual repository maintenance using `ghe-spokesctl` would fail with the following error: `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the speed of migration for code scanning analyses is increased during an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or earlier.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, weekly scheduled runs for code scanning's default setup might not occur.
### [3.11.7: Changes](#3.11.7-changes)

* Gists can be deleted using the **Purge Gist** button on the Deleted Gists page in Staff Tools.
* People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the patterns alerts.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding. For more information, see [Deferring database seeding](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/deferring-database-seeding).
* The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the payload for the push webhook will not contain serialized diff information for each commit. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see [Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push) and [REST API endpoints for commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/commits).

For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, Actions workflows that deploy GitHub Pages sites may fail with the following error:

  ```
  Error: Deployment failed, try again later.

  ```

  To fix this issue, connect to any of the instance's nodes using SSH, then run the following commands.

  ```
  if [ -d "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar" ] ; then
    rm -rf "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar"
  fi
  pages_untar_image_tag="$(cat "$CHROOT_PATH/data/docker-image-tags/pages_untar_image_tag")"

  ``` [Updated: 2024-03-07]

  ```
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
## Enterprise Server 3.11.4

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.4](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.4/download)

January 30, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.4: Bug fixes](#3.11.4-bugs)

* The instance incorrectly wrote the output for multiple workloads to `/var/log/syslog.log`.
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service occurred due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components.
* When starting up an instance using NVME storage in a cloud other than AWS, the attached data disk was not properly detected.
### [3.11.4: Known issues](#3.11.4-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs.

* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Pre-receive hooks which utilize `git rev-list` fail with an `fatal: Invalid revision range` error message.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, Actions workflows that deploy GitHub Pages sites may fail with the following error:

  ```
  Error: Deployment failed, try again later.

  ```

  To fix this issue, connect to any of the instance's nodes using SSH, then run the following commands.

  ```
  if [ -d "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar" ] ; then
    rm -rf "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar"

January 16, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.3: Security fixes](#3.11.3-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges through a command injection vulnerability in the Management Console. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0507](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0507) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: An attacker could leverage an unsafe reflection vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) that could lead to reflection injection. This vulnerability could lead to the execution of user-controlled methods and remote code execution. To exploit this bug, an actor would need to be logged into an account on the GHES instance with the [organization owner role](/en/enterprise-server%403.15/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners). GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0200](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0200) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.3: Bug fixes](#3.11.3-bugs)

* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server using GitHub CLI OAuth App with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* During periods of high load, users would see intermittent interruptions to services when upstream services failed internal health checks.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, site administrators using the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API may have seen a status of `UNKNOWN` for the MSSQL service.
* Hotpatch upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server version `3.11.0` to `3.11.1` resulted in the instance losing network connectivity after a reboot.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Deleting a repository would enqueue unnecessary background jobs that would never complete.
* When creating a new custom pattern for secret scanning, the "More options" section of the custom pattern form automatically collapsed when a user entered an invalid regex in the post processing expressions (before/after secret match or additional secret requirements).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, users could experience a `500` error when viewing a secret scanning alert page in cases where the alerted commits belonged to the user and one or more commits could not be found.
* Members of an enterprise were incorrectly allowed access to the REST API endpoints for Enterprise licensing.
* On an instance that uses SAML for authentication, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 to 3.9 could result in user login failures due to an outdated gem dependency.
* Under rare circumstances, a repository could become unavailable due to a temporary file being left behind after a Git process was unexpectedly interrupted (for example, due to a power outage).
* On an instance with GitHub Advanced Security enabled, a suspended user would consume a license for GitHub Advanced Security.
### [3.11.3: Changes](#3.11.3-changes)

* To avoid leaking secrets, the logging of all parameters is disabled for Management Console events in enterprise audit logs.
* The branch protection setting to require PR approval of the most recent reviewable push is included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
### [3.11.3: Known issues](#3.11.3-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

## Enterprise Server 3.11.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.1/download)

December 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: Hotpatch upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server version `3.11.0` to `3.11.1` will result in the instance losing network connectivity after a reboot. We have removed the hotpatch upgrade package for the `3.11.1` version of GitHub Enterprise Server to ensure this upgrade path is not executed accidentally. Before you upgrade, please make sure you have read the [Known issues](#3.11.1-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.11.1: Security fixes](#3.11.1-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An improper authentication vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a bypass of private mode by using a specially crafted API request. Private mode is the mechanism that enforces authentication for publicly-scoped resources. For more information, see [Enabling private mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-private-mode).

  This vulnerability would allow unauthenticated attackers to gain access to various types of resources set as public on the instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance configured in private mode. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-6847](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6847).
* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access via a race condition when an organization was converted from a user. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46649](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46649) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file in the audit log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that that could allow an attacker to gain access to the Management Console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6802) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: A race condition in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an outside collaborator to be added while a repository is being transferred. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6803](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6803) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** Due to an insufficient entropy vulnerability, an attacker could brute force a user invitation to the Management Console. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed knowledge that a user invitation was pending. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46648](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46648).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could maintain admin access to a transferred repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions during the transfer. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6690) for this vulnerability, which reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Improper privilege management allowed arbitrary workflows to be committed and run using an improperly scoped personal access token. To exploit this, a workflow must have already existed in the target repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6804](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6804) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see [Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps).
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.1: Bug fixes](#3.11.1-bugs)

* In rare cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a failed check on a deleted repository could cause upgrades to a new version of GitHub Enterprise Server to fail.
* Error messages were not shown when `ghe-config-apply` encountered specific kinds of errors.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* In some cases, when an administrator uploaded a custom TLS certificate, the certificate was not correctly installed on the instance.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* In some cases, upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11 could fail due to the Consul server failing to start.
* Endpoints for the REST API's Manage GitHub Enterprise Server operation returned `internal service error` if `cluster.conf` was not found on the instance.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, an issue with `GH_TOKEN` sometimes prevented GitHub Pages sites from building successfully in workflows.
* An administrator could enable GitHub Connect on an instance with a license that does not support GitHub Connect.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to import repositories into GitHub Enterprise Server, the `conflicts` and `audit` subcommands produced an invalid CSV file due to an extra log line appended to the file.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, webhooks for alert locations did not contain information about push protection bypasses.
### [3.11.1: Changes](#3.11.1-changes)

* On an instance with Dependabot updates enabled, Dependabot relies on the node installation provided by the actions runner instead of dynamically downloading.
* To avoid negative effects on disk utilization, `babeld` log files have a maximum size of 15 GB.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* The audit log now tracks all failed password attempts individually. Previously, duplicate failed password attempts in sequence within the same day would be grouped into one failed password attempt, with a `count` field.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
### [3.11.1: Known issues](#3.11.1-known-issues)

* [Hotpatch upgrades](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/upgrading-your-instance/performing-an-upgrade/upgrading-with-a-hotpatch) from GitHub Enterprise Server version `3.11.0` to `3.11.1` will result in the appliance losing network connectivity after a reboot.
  If you have upgraded to GitHub Enterprise Server `3.11.1` from `3.11.0` using a hotpatch upgrade, please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/) for assistance.
  If you have upgraded directly to GitHub Enterprise Server `3.11.1` from previous versions (for example, from any version of GitHub Enterprise Server in the 3.9 or 3.10 series), your instance is not affected by this issue. [Updated 2023-12-27]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0. [Updated 2024-01-03]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2024-02-22]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.11.1: Deprecations](#3.11.1-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see [Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps) and the security fixes for this release.

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.0](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.0/download)

December 05, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server).

### [3.11.0: Features](#3.11.0-features)

* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + Instance administrators can perform administrative tasks using the `gh es` extension for the GitHub CLI. The extension communicates with your instance's management API, so you don't need to SSH into the instance or write a custom application. For more information, see [Administering your instance using the GitHub CLI](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/administering-your-instance-using-the-github-cli).
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + To help users discover the required permissions for calls to a REST API endpoint, GitHub Enterprise Server returns the `X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions` header for requests to endpoints that use fine-grained permissions, including requests from GitHub Apps. For more information, see the following articles.

    - [Troubleshooting the REST API](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/overview/troubleshooting#insufficient-permissions-errors)
    - [Permissions required for fine-grained personal access tokens](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens)
    - [Permissions required for GitHub Apps](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps)
* #### [Audit logs](#audit-logs)

  + The web interface for enterprise, organization, and user audit logs include an expandable view that displays the full audit log payload for each event. Administrators and users can see the same event metadata when searching the audit log in the web interface or via streaming. For more information, see the following articles.

    - [About the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/about-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)
    - [Reviewing the audit log for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization)
    - [Reviewing your security log](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-security-log)
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, in repositories that use default setup for code scanning, the default setup configuration updates automatically if GitHub detects new languages. Users can view a repository's language configuration for default setup from the repository's "Code security and analysis" settings page. Additionally, users can view information about setup and debug failed languages from the tools status page. For more information, see the following articles.

    - [Configuring default setup for code scanning at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale#about-adding-languages-to-an-existing-default-setup-configuration)
    - [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning)
    - [About the tool status page for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page)
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, default setup for code scanning at the organization level is now generally available. For more information, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale) and [REST API endpoints for organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/orgs/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#enable-or-disable-a-security-feature-for-an-organization) in the REST API documentation.
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during configuration of default setup for code scanning, users can select either the "Extended" or "Default" query suite for eligible repositories in an organization. For more information, see [CodeQL query suites](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/built-in-codeql-query-suites) and [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning).
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, to better protect active and inactive repositories, GitHub Enterprise Server automatically analyzes repositories that use a default setup for code scanning. The analysis runs on a weekly schedule and uses the most recent version of CodeQL. When configuring code scanning, the fixed time for the weekly scan is randomly chosen. The scan will take place at the same time every week, and the schedule is displayed after the setup is completed, so users can easily see when the next scheduled analysis will occur. The scheduled analysis will be automatically disabled if a repository has no activity for six months. Creation of a pull request or pushes to the repository will re-enable scheduled analysis.
  + Code scanning default setup is available for Swift analysis with CodeQL. For more information, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically).
  + CodeQL 2.14.6 and later supports analysis of code written in Go 1.21. For more information, see [Supported languages and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) in the CodeQL documentation.
  + With CodeQL model packs for Java, users can improve code scanning results by ensuring that any custom Java libraries and frameworks used by their codebase are recognized by CodeQL. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - [Editing your configuration of default setup](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup#extending-codeql-coverage-with-codeql-model-packs-in-default-setup)
    - [Customizing your advanced setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#extending-codeql-coverage-with-codeql-model-packs)
    - [Using the CodeQL model editor](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/using-the-codeql-model-editor) in the CodeQL documentation
  + For instances with GitHub Connect configured, code scanning with CodeQL supports Java codebases that use [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/). Previously, code scanning users were able to scan Java applications that contained Lombok code, but all the contents of files containing Lombok code were either skipped or users had to apply a workaround to prepare the applications for scanning. Lombok features will now be automatically scanned without requiring any workaround.

    For more information about syncing the required GitHub Actions workflow to scan Lombok code, see [Configuring code scanning for your appliance](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-github-connect-to-sync-github-actions).
  + Push protection for secret scanning is now generally available. For more information, see [About push protection](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning).
  + To prevent the leak of tokens where users work outside of code, secret scanning detects tokens in both new and historical issue titles, descriptions, and comments. When a new token type is added to secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server scans for matches automatically. This expanded coverage also detects and surfaces secrets that match any custom pattern defined at the repository, organization, or enterprise level. These secrets appear both in the web interface and in queries to the REST API. For more information, see [About secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) and [Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning).
  + Users can view metrics associated with push protection usage across an organization. The overview shows a summary of blocks and bypasses, as well as more granular metrics. For more information, see [Assessing your code security risk](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-code-security-risk).
  + A new REST API endpoint is available for dataflow analysis using custom CodeQL queries. The new endpoint offers additional flexibility, includes improvements that prevent common pitfalls with the old API, and improves the performance of query evaluation by five percent. For more information, see [New dataflow API for writing custom CodeQL queries](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-08-14-new-dataflow-api-for-writing-custom-codeql-queries/) in the GitHub Changelog.
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + For developers who manage Node.js dependencies using the pnpm package manager, pnpm is fully supported by dependency graph, Dependabot alerts, and Dependabot security updates. For more information about securing your supply chain with Dependabot, see [Keeping your supply chain secure with Dependabot](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot).
  + Developers can enforce policies related to vulnerabilities and licenses in pull requests for complex ecosystems with transitive dependencies like Gradle and Scala. Dependency review supports dependencies from the dependency submission API. For more information, see the following articles.

    - [About dependency review](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review#best-practices-for-using-the-dependency-review-api-and-the-dependency-submission-api-together)
    - [About dependency review](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review)
    - [Using the dependency submission API](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)
  + To control how Dependabot structures pull requests and improve mergeability, users can implement flexible grouping options in `dependabot.yml`. You can also control Dependabot's behavior for groups using comment commands. For more information, see [Dependabot options reference](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference#groups) and [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands).
  + Dependabot can open pull requests for Swift and Gradle dependencies.

    - Users can also configure scheduled updates for Swift dependencies using `dependabot.yml`.
    - If users have used the REST API for dependency submission to upload Gradle dependencies to the dependency graph and receive Dependabot alerts for those dependencies, Dependabot will try to open a pull request to resolve security updates enabled for the repository.

    For more information, see [Configuring Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates).
  + Responses from REST API endpoints for repositories display whether Dependabot security updates are enabled or disabled. Users can also enable or disable security updates for a repository using the REST API. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/repos/repos) in the REST API documentation.
  + When Dependabot is first enabled, GitHub will not send notifications for all vulnerable dependencies found in the repository, only for new vulnerable dependencies ifentified after Dependabot is enabled. For more information, see [Configuring notifications for Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-notifications-for-dependabot-alerts).
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + To assess risks to code security and ensure adoption of features to improve code security, the "Security risk" and "Security coverage" pages for organizations and the entire instance are generally available. Additionally, the alert-centric pages for Dependabot, code scanning, and secret scanning are also now generally available. For more information, see [Assessing your code security risk](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-code-security-risk) and [Assessing adoption of code security features](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-adoption-code-security).
  + Users can take advantage of the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) using the REST API. The Advisory Database is a free, open-source list of actionable security advisories and CVEs. API responses include machine-readable mappings to the ecosystem, package name, and affected versions of impacted software. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for global security advisories](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/security-advisories/global-advisories) in the REST API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.309.0. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.309.0). If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release. [Updated: 2024-04-25]
  + To better navigate, trace, understand, and monitor deployments, users can view and track the full history of deployments in a repository or filter across environments. For more information, see [Viewing deployment history](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/deployment/managing-your-deployments/viewing-deployment-history).
  + Users can improve the security of deployment environments by configuring a branch protection policy to only allow specific branches to deploy to an environment. Additionally, the following security improvements apply to environments.

    - GitHub Enterprise Server blocks runs triggered from forks with branch names that match the protected branch's name.
    - Tags with the same name as a protected branch cannot deploy to the environments with a branch protection configuration.

    For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#deployment-branches).
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a configuration for deployment environments, administrators for environments can improve the security of deployments by enforcing a review by someone other than the person who triggered the run. This option prevents required reviewers from self-reviewing to trigger workflows. For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#required-reviewers).
* #### [Organizations](#organizations)

  + Organization owners can signal that an organization is no longer actively maintained by archiving the organization. For more information, see [Archiving an organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/organizations/managing-organization-settings/archiving-an-organization).
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + Users can govern protections for branches and tags in a repository using repository rules. To govern the protections for all of an organization's repositories, users can also enable rulesets for an organization. Contributors to a repository can see which rules apply via the web interface, Git, or the GitHub CLI. For more information, see [About rulesets](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).
  + Users can create new repositories with predefined attributes using query parameters. For example, a user can create a URL that prepopulates information about the repository like the name, description, visibility, and more. For more information, see [Creating a new repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository#creating-a-new-repository-from-a-url-query).
  + Users can more easily understand changes to a repository using the activity view. For more information, see [Using the activity view to see changes to a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/using-the-activity-view-to-see-changes-to-a-repository).
* #### [Issues](#issues)

  + Users can automatically add a new issue to projects using a custom issue form by defining `projects` in the issue template. For more information, see [Syntax for issue forms](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms).
* #### [Projects](#projects)

  + Users can review items in a project view broken down by a certain field value. For more information, see [Customizing the table layout](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-table-layout#slicing-by-field-values).
  + Users can create charts to visualize current project items, or visualize project items over time. For more information, see [About insights for Projects](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/viewing-insights-from-your-project/about-insights-for-projects).
* #### [Accessibility](#accessibility)

  + To improve the visibility of links with blocks of text in the web interface for GitHub Enterprise Server, users can apply underline styling. For more information, see [Managing accessibility settings](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/managing-accessibility-settings#managing-the-appearance-of-links).
### [3.11.0: Changes](#3.11.0-changes)

* The speed of restoration operations with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities has increased.
* Configuration runs now correspond with a unique ID. During the run, the log remains at `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`. After the run, the instance rotates the log's contents into `/data/user/config-apply/logs/YYYYMMDD/ghe-config.HOSTNAME.ID.log`, where YYYYMMDD is the date of the run, HOSTNAME is the hostname of the node, and ID is the ID of the run. For more information, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#log-files-for-instance-configuration).
* Field names for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed as part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). Additional field names were changed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and 3.10. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

  + `level` is now `SeverityText`.
  + `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
  + `now` is now `Timestamp`.
  + Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
  + Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  For a full list of mappings, download the OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server [3.9](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv), [3.10](/assets/ghes-3.10-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv), and [3.11](/assets/ghes-3.11-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv).
* On an instance that uses built-in authentication or LDAP, if two-factor authentication (2FA) is configured for an organization, a user could use a TOTP code multiple times within the code's window of validity during authentication or when entering sudo mode for sensitive actions. To improve security, this reuse is no longer allowed. External systems with a scripted login flow across multiple parallel jobs may stop working as a result of this change.

  For more information about 2FA, see the following articles.

* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, during analysis of Python projects with code scanning using CodeQL and an advanced setup, GitHub Enterprise Server would automatically install dependencies for the project. Due to improvements to CodeQL, GitHub Enterprise Server no longer needs to fetch these dependencies to analyze a codebase. To improve scan times for Python projects, automatic dependency installation is disabled.

  If you configured code scanning with CodeQL via advanced setup to disable dependency installation, GitHub recommends setting `setup-python-dependencies` to `false` for the configuration. For more information, see [Customizing your advanced setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#analyzing-python-dependencies).
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, due to misconfiguration or incompatible versions, Dependabot jobs for a repository can fail. After 30 failed runs, subsequent scheduled jobs will fail immediately until you trigger a check for updates from the dependency graph, or until you update a manifest file. Jobs for Dependabot security updates will still trigger normally.
* On an instance with GitHub Advanced Security, to help users more efficiently review and filter code scanning alerts at scale using the REST API, the `updated_at` field in API responses is improved. The `updated_at` timestamp now represents an alert's most recent state change on the branch that you requested. State changes include an alert being introduced, fixed, dismissed, reopened, or reintroduced. Previously, the `updated_at` timestamp changed frequently, whenever an alert was found in an analysis or the alert state changed. For more information about using the REST API to retrieve code scanning alerts, see [REST API endpoints for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/code-scanning/code-scanning?apiVersion=2022-11-28) in the REST API documentation.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, the following improvements apply to the repository view for dependency graph, available from the repository's "Insights" tab.

  + Users can search by package name from a paginated list of all dependencies.
  + Dependency licenses are displayed.
  + Dependabot alerts appear for dependencies, sorted by severity, and link to the Dependabot alerts and the Dependabot update pull request where applicable.

  For more information about the dependency graph, see [About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).
* After first enabling Dependabot on an instance, GitHub Enterprise Server will no longer send web or email notifications for repositories that are initially populated with Dependabot alerts. This allows you to review the new Dependabot alerts for a repository, organization, or the entire instance without immediately notifying other users of existing alerts.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, workflows that use Node.js 16 or earlier will log a warning. Node.js 16 has been end-of-life since [September 2023](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/#end-of-life-releases).

  + Workflow authors should update actions to run on Node.js 20. For more information, see [Metadata syntax for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions).
  + Users with workflows that use Node.js should specify Node.js 20 or later in the workflows using versioned actions. For more information, see [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-versioned-actions).

  [Updated: 2024-03-05]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and runners using GitHub Actions Runner 2.309.0 or later, users can no longer use `GITHUB_ENV` to set the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable in workflows. Workflows that set `NODE_OPTIONS` as an environment variable will now log the following error. For more information, see [Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable) and the [v2.309.0 release](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.309.0) in the actions/runner repository on GitHub.com.

  ```
  Can't store NODE_OPTIONS output parameter using '$GITHUB_ENV' command.

  ```
* Users can quickly take action on multiple items in a group, or the group itself, using the `•••` button in a table, board, or roadmap.
* Users can break out items in a project by workstreams, team members, priorities, or other groupings using a swimlane view. For more information, see [Customizing the board layout](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-board-layout#grouping-by-field-values).
* Users can view view the template used to create a project from a project's settings.
* When scrolling through a project, group headers are now sticky.
* The colors for single-select fields in a project have been updated, so users see the same colors within the field picker and within project views.
* Users create can create issues in a project view that's grouped by repository in the board layout by clicking "Create new issue", or by starting to type the issue's title.
### [3.11.0: Known issues](#3.11.0-known-issues)

* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.0 may fail, hanging on the "Reloading system services" screen. The following error will appear in `/var/log/syslog`.

  ```
  agent: Error starting agent: error="Failed to start Consul server: Failed to start Raft: failed to load any existing snapshots"

  ```

  This issue is resolved in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.1. When upgrading to a release in the 3.11 series, upgrade to 3.11.1 or later. [Updated 2023-12-21]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.11.0: Deprecations](#3.11.0-deprecations)

* #### [Enterprise-level security overview is deprecated](#enterprise-level-security-overview-is-deprecated)

  + The enterprise-level "Security overview" page is deprecated in favor of the new "Security risk" and "Security coverage" pages. For more information, see [Assessing your code security risk](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-code-security-risk) and [Assessing adoption of code security features](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-adoption-code-security).
* #### [Dependabot updates no longer support Python 3.6 or 3.7](#dependabot-updates-no-longer-support-python-36-or-37)

  + Dependabot updates no longer support Python 3.6 or 3.7, which have reached end-of-life. If a user's code uses these versions, Dependabot will no longer be able to open pull requests in your repository and will log errors. Update to Python 3.8 or later to ensure your code is secure and Dependabot can still run.

    Users will continue to receive Dependabot alerts for dependencies with known vulnerabilities. To resolve these alerts, users can manually upgrade the affected package.

    For more information about Python releases, see [Status of Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions) on the Python website. For more information about supported package managers for Dependabot, see [About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems).
* #### [Upcoming deprecation of team discussions](#upcoming-deprecation-of-team-discussions)

  + GitHub will deprecate team discussions for users in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13. In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11, a banner appears atop teams' discussions with information about the deprecation, including a link to tooling to migrate existing team discussions to GitHub Discussions. For more information, see [About team discussions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions) and [About discussions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions). [Updated: 2024-03-04]
* #### [Elasticsearch index `repository-stack` is no longer in use](#elasticsearch-index-repository-stack-is-no-longer-in-use)

  + The Elasticsearch index `repository-stacks` is no longer in use. [Updated: 2024-06-24]
### [3.11.0: Errata](#3.11.0-errata)

* The [Changes](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes#3.11.0-changes) section previously indicated that users should update GitHub Actions workflows and actions to run on Node.js 16. Node.js 16 has reached end of life, and users should instead update actions and workflows to run on Node.js 20 or later. [Updated: 2024-03-05]
