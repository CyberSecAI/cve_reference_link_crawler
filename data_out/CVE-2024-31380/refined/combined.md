# Client Control Remote Code Execution – Oxygen <= 4.8.1 – CVE-2024-31380

| CVE | CVE-2024-31380 ([Patchstack link](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/oxygen/wordpress-oxygen-plugin-4-8-1-auth-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability)) |

## Description

---

The Oxygen page builder is vulnerable to remote code execution (**RCE**) in versions <= 4.8.1, which means that an **attacker can run arbitrary code/system commands and take over the site/server.**

To exploit this vulnerability, **a user must have been granted “builder access”** to Oxygen in the past. **“Edit Only” access is sufficient.**
Oxygen has a dedicated [Client Control](https://oxygenbuilder.com/documentation/other/client-control/) which is commonly used to give non-technical end-users highly restricted access to the page builder.

If one of these accounts is compromised (or used maliciously), it can be used to achieve RCE.

## Proof of concept

---

Technical details will not be released for at least a week.

## Proposed patch

---

Technical details will not be published for at least a week.

## Timeline

---

| Vendor contacted | February 11, 2024 (Snicco contacts Patchstack) |
| --- | --- |
| First Response | February 16, 2024 (Patchstack validated the issue) |
| Fully patched at | Not patched |
| Publicly disclosed | April 03, 2024 |

## Miscellaneous

---

The Oxygen team did not consider this a security vulnerability, but rather a documentation error, and did not issue a patch.

According to them, the “Client Control” never aimed to perform any sorts of permission check, but rather only simplify the visual editor for clients.

When we discovered the vulnerability this was not reflected in the documentation at all and “Client Control” was supposed to be safe for non-technical users (non-admins) with probably loose(r) security hygiene and hardening.

The documentation has now been updated and contains the following:

> Note that while Code Blocks are visually restricted in Edit Only mode, a malicious user could still execute arbitrary PHP code if they have access to Oxygen, so **DO NOT GRANT OXYGEN ACCESS TO UNTRUSTED USERS.**
>
> <https://oxygenbuilder.com/documentation/other/client-control/>

Regardless, Snicco & Patchstack **strongly disagree** with this assessment, as it is roughly analogous to WordPress Core saying something like:

“Contributors can now do everything an admin can. Instead of enforcing permissions, WordPress now just hides the sensitive admin menu links in the sidebar – “Be sure to make only trusted users a contributor”.

This mindset goes against anything that access control is supposed to do.

We hope the Oxygen team reconsiders their decision, especially given that the proposed patch is not too difficult to implement.

# Risks

CVSS 9.9

This vulnerability is moderately dangerous and expected to become exploited.

##### 9.9

### Remote Code Execution (RCE)

This could allow a malicious actor to execute commands on the target website. This can be used to gain backdoor access to then take full control of the website.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

We advise to mitigate or resolve the vulnerability immediately.

### Automatically mitigate vulnerabilities and keep your websites safe

Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate this issue by blocking any attacks until
an official fix becomes available, can be tested and be safely applied.

# Details

This is not a false positive. The "Edit Only" permission which is meant to grant limited content edit access to users on Oxygen is by default vulnerable to RCE. Regardless of the existing warnings in place, code execution on the lowest permission available is against common access control principles and should not be made possible.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
