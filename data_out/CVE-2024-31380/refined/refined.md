Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Oxygen page builder plugin's "Client Control" feature, intended for restricted access by non-technical users, does not properly enforce permission checks.
- Specifically, users with "Edit Only" access, meant for limited content editing, can still execute arbitrary PHP code using the builder's code block functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most critical weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary code/system commands on the server.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The "Edit Only" permission fails to restrict users from accessing and using code execution capabilities within the Oxygen builder.
- **Misinterpretation of "Client Control":** The Oxygen team viewed the feature as a visual simplification tool rather than a security measure, contrary to user expectations for limited access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full Site/Server Takeover:** An attacker can use the RCE vulnerability to gain control of the website and potentially the entire server.
- **Data Breach:** Once access is gained, sensitive data can be stolen or modified.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install backdoors and other malware on the compromised system.
- **Website Defacement:** The website can be defaced and its content modified.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Compromised Client Accounts:** The primary attack vector involves exploiting legitimate "Edit Only" accounts if they are compromised or used maliciously.
- **Abuse of Code Blocks:** Attackers use the Oxygen builder's code block functionality, which is meant for adding custom code, to inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **"Edit Only" Access:** The attacker needs to possess an "Edit Only" user account within Oxygen. This account does not need administrator level privileges but must have access to the Oxygen builder.
- **Knowledge of Oxygen Builder:** The attacker must know how to use the Oxygen builder to inject code.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Code:** The attacker must be able to craft the malicious PHP code to execute on the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Oxygen Builder versions <= 4.9. The version described in the detailed report is 4.8.1.
- The Oxygen team initially didn't classify this as a security vulnerability but a documentation issue. However, the documentation has been updated to warn against giving Oxygen access to untrusted users.
- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the issue.
- The CVSS score for the vulnerability is 9.9, indicating a high severity.
