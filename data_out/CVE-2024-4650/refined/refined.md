  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `due_month` parameter within the `/view/student_due_payment.php` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

This could lead to a variety of malicious activities such as displaying inappropriate content, stealing user session cookies, or downloading malware onto the user's system without their knowledge.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "vector": "The attacker injects a malicious payload into the `due_month` parameter of the `/view/student_due_payment.php` file through a crafted request.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application with a malicious payload injected into the `due_month` parameter. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The provided payload `due_month=due_month'\"()%26%25<zzz><ScRiPt%20>alert(9616)</ScRiPt>` demonstrates how an attacker can inject JavaScript code."
