# USBX Host CDC ECD integer underflow with buffer overflow

Moderate

[liydu](/liydu)
published
GHSA-chpp-5fv9-6368
Oct 10, 2022

## Package

USBX
(Azure RTOS)

## Affected versions

< 6.1.12

## Patched versions

6.1.12

## Description

### Impact

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service.

Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string\_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service.

### Patches

We analyzed this bug and determined that we needed to fix it. This fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel)

### Workarounds

Improve mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values.
