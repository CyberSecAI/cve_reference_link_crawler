- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Community by PeepSo plugin versions <= 6.1.6.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing malicious actors to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious actor crafting a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, executes unwanted actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious webpage. The attacker is unauthenticated.
