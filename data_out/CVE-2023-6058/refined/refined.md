- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Bitdefender Safepay improperly handles HTTPS connections by allowing users to add sites with untrusted certificates to an exception list, leading the product to trust these certificates for subsequent scans.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper HTTPS certificate validation. Specifically, the application does not properly validate untrusted certificates when a user adds them to the exception list.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, intercepting and potentially altering secure communications. This is achieved using a self-signed certificate that the product will trust after being added to exceptions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be positioned in a network path to perform a MITM attack and present a self-signed certificate for the target site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the capability to intercept network traffic (MITM) and the victim must add the malicious site to the exception list.
