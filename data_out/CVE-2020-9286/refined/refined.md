- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization in FortiADC. The system does not properly verify user permissions before allowing them to perform certain actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, allowing users with low privileges to execute actions that should be restricted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, authenticated user with low privileges can perform actions such as rebooting the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges on the affected FortiADC system.
