* Test polynomial backtracking ReDoS attack string on Bash

Create a unit test for a (new) ReDoS string on bash. This test should be
failing in this commit.

* Fix ReDoS (as seen in ReDoS test 1) for bash

Update bash escaping to pessimistically escape opening curly braces,
similar to Zsh escaping, to fix the ReDoS due to the complex regular
expression for opening curly braces.

Update tests accordingly.

* Test against old ReDoS values and all shells

Refactor the ReDoS test such that 1) it's tested against all (supported)
shells, and 2) extensible to test against multiple potential ReDoS
strings. Regarding the latter, the scope has been updated to include
known ReDoS strings related to CVE-2022-36064.

The `redos` value is intentionally a function as this avoids building
the string unnecessarily if the file is imported but the `redos` value
isn't used.

* Update SECURITY.md

Add latest advisory and credit its finder
```
