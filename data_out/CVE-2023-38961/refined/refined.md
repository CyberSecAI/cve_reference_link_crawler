Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an invalid identifier usage within an import statement, specifically after the "as" keyword. The parser is not handling this syntax error correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The primary vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `scanner_is_context_needed` function. This occurs due to improper handling of an invalid identifier in the import statement.
- Assertion failure: When running with debug mode, the issue results in an assertion failure in `scanner_is_context_needed` function at line 2080 which further highlights the incorrect handling of context within the scanner.
- Incorrect Syntax handling: The parser should throw a syntax error but fails to do so, which indicates incorrect syntax validation during parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash of the JerryScript engine due to memory corruption, which can result in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Javascript: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted JavaScript file containing an import statement with an invalid identifier after the `as` keyword.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code via the JerryScript engine.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific Javascript payload containing the vulnerable `import` statement.

**Technical Details**
- The issue is located in `/jerryscript/jerry-core/parser/js/js-scanner-util.c` line 2101 (heap-buffer-overflow) and 2080 (assertion failure).
- The vulnerable code snippet is within the `scanner_is_context_needed` function, indicating that the context checking during scanning is flawed.
- The issue arises during the parsing stage.
- The provided test case demonstrates the heap-buffer-overflow.
