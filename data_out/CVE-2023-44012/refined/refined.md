Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `Help.aspx` component of mojoPortal version 2.7.0.0. Specifically, the `helpkey` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for injection of malicious code. This is a bypass of a previous fix (CVE-2017-1000457).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to neutralize user-supplied input (`helpkey` parameter) before using it in the `Help.aspx` page, which allows for injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing user credentials or other sensitive data.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker crafts a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `helpkey` parameter of `Help.aspx`.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker would likely need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker relies on the victim to open the crafted URL in their browser.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content indicates that this is a bypass of CVE-2017-1000457, suggesting a previous fix was not sufficient.
* The vulnerability affects mojoPortal version 2.7.0.0.
