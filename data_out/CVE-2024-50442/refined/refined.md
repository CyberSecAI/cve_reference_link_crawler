Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress Royal Elementor Addons Plugin (versions <= 1.3.980) is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The plugin processes XML input in a way that allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code. This code can reference external entities, which the server then processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** An attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability to force the server to reveal sensitive information by accessing local files or internal resources.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting malicious XML, an attacker could cause the server to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability may allow an attacker to make requests to internal or external servers from the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XML Injection:** The attacker injects malicious XML code into an input field or process where XML data is parsed by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted XML to the vulnerable plugin. The specific requirements for how this XML is sent is not specified in this document.
*   The attacker needs some level of interaction with the plugin to inject XML. The exact method (e.g., through a form, API, etc.) is not detailed in the provided context.
