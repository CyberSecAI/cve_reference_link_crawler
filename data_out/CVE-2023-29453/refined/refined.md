The provided content is related to CVE-2023-29453.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of backticks (`) within Javascript template literals in Go templates. Specifically, Go template actions inside JavaScript template literals are not correctly escaped, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
*   Lack of proper escaping of backticks within JavaScript template literals

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Go template, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes, such as data exfiltration, session hijacking, or other forms of remote code execution, depending on the context in which the template is used.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious template containing a Go template action within a JavaScript template literal. When this template is processed, the attacker's injected JavaScript code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to influence the content of Go templates that are processed. This would likely require control over a data source that feeds into a template.
