You need to specify the -o before the input file.  This used to trigger a SEGV due to the output pointer being uninitialised. This would have happened for any input file, not just this fuzzed one. This bug was fixed in:  commit [40ac85bfb676bb4373bda4b18f9fd90268c9f1e9](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?40ac85bfb676bb4373bda4b18f9fd90268c9f1e9) Author: Sebastian Rasmussen <sebras@gmail.com> Date:   Sat Feb 4 06:21:20 2017 +0100      [Bug 697514](show_bug.cgi?id=697514 "RESOLVED FIXED - Null pointer dereference in dodrawpage()"): Write SVG output to stdout if no output specified.  So, I am proceeding to check with the latest version of the source (commit [24bfb2d](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?24bfb2d)) on 64bit Ubuntu, using:   mutool draw -F svg -o /dev/null mupdf_null_ptr_dodrawpage  As far as I can tell, this invocation NEVER calls fz_subsample_pixmap... ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=697515#c5)  Robin Watts    2017-02-08 02:58:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Agostino Sarubbo from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=697515#c2)) > This is reproducible with the current stable with the following testcase:  "current stable" is unhelpful.

In addition the code never calls fz_subsample_pixmap.  I am therefore closing this bug. Feel free to reopen it if you can give me more information as to how to reproduce it. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=697515#c7)  Kamil Frankowicz    2017-02-08 08:23:12 UTC  ``` Awww... Sorry for the inconvenience. Once again wrong command...
