Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-9184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to an incorrect use of the `wp_kses_allowed_html` function within the SendPulse Free Web Push plugin. This function is intended to sanitize HTML input, but its improper implementation in the plugin allowed for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. This means an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings or database that are stored and executed when other users view the affected pages.
* **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper input sanitization, specifically related to how HTML is handled before being displayed on a webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website.
* **Compromised User Accounts:** The injected scripts can be used to steal user session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the users, including administrators.
* **Website Defacement:** The scripts could alter the appearance of the website or redirect users to malicious sites.
* **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could potentially use the website to distribute malware to its visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Unauthenticated Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
* **Web Input:** Malicious scripts are injected through web input fields within the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **No Access Required:** Attackers do not need any privileges on the WordPress website to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Network Access:** An attacker requires network access to the WordPress site to inject the malicious scripts.
