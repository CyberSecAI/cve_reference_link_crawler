I have just started a small business and started a free trial (which is a plus) with Sendpulse and I love their service. I have moved on from the free trial into a pay as you go plan and couldn’t be happier. Their service is fast and straight-forward. Their live chat has been a big help for a newcomer like me. I highly recommend the free trial but I am sure you will love it to be a permanent user.

### Description

The SendPulse Free Web Push plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6 due to incorrect use of the wp\_kses\_allowed\_html function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
