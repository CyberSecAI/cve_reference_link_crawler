The SendPulse Free Web Push plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6 due to incorrect use of the wp_kses_allowed_html function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
