## Description

SendPulse Web Push is a WordPress plugin that allows you to send [web push](https://sendpulse.com/features/webpush) campaigns.

Web push notifications are instant notifications sent to subscribers’ devices. They allow you to quickly inform your customers about recent news, sales, order statuses, or other important events.

Your site visitors can sign up to receive notifications about your new posts or important events.

#### FEATURES

1. Browsers supported: Chrome (Desktop & Android), Firefox (Desktop), and Opera (Desktop) on both HTTP and HTTPS sites.
2. Offline notifications: Users will see your notification as soon as they go online.
3. Personalization and segmentation: Your site visitors can receive personalized notifications. Segment your web push campaigns based on users’ location or other details.
4. A/B Testing: Maximize your web push campaigns’ CTR by split-testing them.
5. Trigger messages and bulk messages: Send web push notifications via your personal account, or create automated campaigns triggered by certain events.
6. Real Time Stats: Monitor your open rate, click-through rate, subscription rate, and more.
7. Developer API: Use SendPulse’s API to send web push notifications, emails, and SMS messages via a single platform.

   Send an unlimited number of web push notifications to 10,000 subscribers for free. [With RSS](https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/push-notifications/rss-campaign), your subscribers will receive notifications as soon as a new post is published on your WordPress site.

   Create a [SendPulse account](https://sendpulse.com/register) to start sending your web push campaigns.

I have just started a small business and started a free trial (which is a plus) with Sendpulse and I love their service. I have moved on from the free trial into a pay as you go plan and couldn’t be happier. Their service is fast and straight-forward. Their live chat has been a big help for a newcomer like me. I highly recommend the free trial but I am sure you will love it to be a permanent user.
