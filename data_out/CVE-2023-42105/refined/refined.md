- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of AR files, which leads to a type confusion condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion vulnerability within the AR file parsing functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious AR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious AR file or a link to a malicious page to the victim. User interaction is required.
