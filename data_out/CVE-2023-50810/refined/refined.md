- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the U-Boot component of the firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Allows persistent arbitrary code execution with Linux kernel privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation leads to persistent arbitrary code execution with Linux kernel privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Physical access to the device.
    - Obtaining write access to the flash memory through a separate runtime vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** 
    - An attacker needs physical access to the device or the ability to write to the flash memory through another exploit.
