The Elementor Website Builder – More than Just a Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘hover_animation’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.21.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
