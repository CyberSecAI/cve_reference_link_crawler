- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it is dereferenced as a pointer when handling App objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction. The target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file to be exploited.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious page or file that, when accessed by a user, triggers the vulnerable code path in PDF-XChange Editor.
