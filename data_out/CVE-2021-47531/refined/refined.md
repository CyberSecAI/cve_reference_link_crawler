The provided content relates to a fix for a bug in the Linux kernel's MSM (Qualcomm Adreno GPU) DRM driver, specifically concerning the `mmap` functionality. This fix is related to the issue described in the CVE description, which indicates a missing flag in the mmap implementation.

**Root Cause:**
A previous commit (510410bfc034) refactored the `mmap` implementation for GEM objects in the MSM DRM driver. This change unintentionally bypassed a code path that set important flags (`VM_IO` and `VM_DONTDUMP`) on the virtual memory area (VMA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The refactored `msm_gem_object_mmap` function failed to set the `VM_IO` and `VM_DONTDUMP` flags, which are necessary for proper memory mapping, particularly when used with Android Runtime (ARC++). This leads to memory access issues, specifically related to user space access.
- By not setting `VM_IO`, the memory mapping does not get the "IO" semantics which it expects. This leads to issues when the memory is accessed by user space, causing a crash.
- By not setting `VM_DONTDUMP`, the memory pages can get included in crash dumps, which can be very large and cause problems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel crashes can occur, specifically when using ARC++ on Chromebooks, particularly during logout processes.
- The crashes lead to system instability.
- Specific crash is a kernel paging request at an address (ffffffc008000000) that is not backed by any physical memory. This then leads to a kernel panic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a userspace process (e.g., ARC++) attempts to access memory mapped via the MSM DRM driver.
- It is triggered by how mmap works, so can be triggered by any user space program using mmap with a msm gem object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to run code on a system using the affected MSM DRM driver.
- No specific privileges needed to trigger the issue, it would occur naturally when using the graphics subsystem.
