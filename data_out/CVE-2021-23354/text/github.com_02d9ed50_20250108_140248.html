* could you leave commented the old regexp with a detail comment about the reason of the change
* is this functionality well covered by unit tests, otherwise it would be safer to add some

### **[yetingli](/yetingli)** commented [Feb 12, 2021](#issuecomment-778076213)

| * First of all, I want to point out that the old regexp `/\%(?:\(([\w_.]+)\)|([1-9]\d*)\$)?([0 +\-\#]*)(\*|\d+)?(\.)?(\*|\d+)?[hlL]?([\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/` has a cubic worst-case time complexity behavior due to overlapping capture groups `([0 +\-\#]*)(\*|\d+)?(\.)?(\*|\d+)?`. And a pump string of `0` can be consumed by `([0 +\-\#]*)`, `(\*|\d+)?`, or `(\*|\d+)?`. * The solution I'm giving now is to replace the sub-regexp `(\*|\d+)?(\.)?(\*|\d+)?` with the sub-regexp `(\*|\d+)?(?:(\.)(\*|\d+)?)?`. The two are equivalent, as shown in the following two figures.   * In addition, the performance comparison after repair, see [ReDoS in printf #31 (comment)](https://github.com/adaltas/node-printf/issues/31#issuecomment-776731490) |
