Ant Media Server Community Edition in a default configuration is vulnerable to an improper HTTP header based authorization, leading to a possible use of non-administrative API calls reserved only for authorized users. 
All versions up to 2.9.0 (tested) and possibly newer ones are believed to be vulnerable as the vendor has not confirmed releasing a patch.
