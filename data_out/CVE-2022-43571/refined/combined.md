# Detection: Splunk Code Injection via custom dashboard leading to RCE

**EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION**

This detection status is set to experimental. The Splunk Threat Research team has not yet fully tested, simulated, or built comprehensive datasets for this detection. As such, this analytic is not officially supported. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at research@splunk.com.

### Description

The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit a vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.2.9, 8.1.12, and 9.0.2, where an authenticated user can execute arbitrary code via the dashboard PDF generation component. It detects this activity by analyzing events in the \_internal index with the file=export parameter. This behavior is significant because it indicates a potential code injection attack, which could lead to remote code execution (RCE). If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially compromise the entire Splunk environment.

### Data Source

No data sources specified for this detection.

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [splunkd\_ui](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_ui.yml) | `index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access` |
| splunk\_code\_injection\_via\_custom\_dashboard\_leading\_to\_rce\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_code_injection_via_custom_dashboard_leading_to_rce_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the \_internal index.

### Known False Positives

Not all exports and downloads are malicious, special attention must be put as well on /en-US/splunkd/\_\_raw/services/pdfgen/render in the context of this search.

### Associated Analytic Story

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Potential exploitation of Code Injection via Dashboard PDF generation. | 25 | 50 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
