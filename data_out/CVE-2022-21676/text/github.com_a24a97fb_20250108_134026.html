**IMPORTANT SECURITY FIX**

A malicious client could send a specially crafted HTTP request,
triggering an uncaught exception and killing the Node.js process:

> RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear
>   at Receiver.getInfo (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:176:14)
>   at Receiver.startLoop (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:136:22)
>   at Receiver._write (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:83:10)
>   at writeOrBuffer (internal/streams/writable.js:358:12)

This bug was introduced by [1], included in `engine.io@4.0.0`, so
previous releases are not impacted.

Thanks to Marcus Wejderot from Mevisio for the responsible disclosure.
