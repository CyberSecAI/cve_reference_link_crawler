⚠️ This release contains an important security fix ⚠️

A malicious client could send a specially crafted HTTP request, triggering an uncaught exception and killing the Node.js process:

> RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear
>
> at Receiver.getInfo (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:176:14)
>
> at Receiver.startLoop (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:136:22)
>
> at Receiver.\_write (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:83:10)
>
> at writeOrBuffer (internal/streams/writable.js:358:12)

This bug was introduced by [this commit](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/f3c291fa613a9d50c924d74293035737fdace4f2), included in `engine.io@4.0.0`, so previous releases are not impacted.

Thanks to Marcus Wejderot from Mevisio for the responsible disclosure.
