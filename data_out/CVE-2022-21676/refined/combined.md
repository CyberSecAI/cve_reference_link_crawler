```
**IMPORTANT SECURITY FIX**

A malicious client could send a specially crafted HTTP request,
triggering an uncaught exception and killing the Node.js process:

> RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear
>   at Receiver.getInfo (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:176:14)
>   at Receiver.startLoop (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:136:22)
>   at Receiver._write (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:83:10)
>   at writeOrBuffer (internal/streams/writable.js:358:12)

This bug was introduced by [1], included in `engine.io@4.0.0`, so
previous releases are not impacted.

Thanks to Marcus Wejderot from Mevisio for the responsible disclosure.

**IMPORTANT SECURITY FIX**

A malicious client could send a specially crafted HTTP request,
triggering an uncaught exception and killing the Node.js process:

> RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear
>   at Receiver.getInfo (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:176:14)
>   at Receiver.startLoop (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:136:22)
>   at Receiver._write (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:83:10)
>   at writeOrBuffer (internal/streams/writable.js:358:12)

This bug was introduced by [1], included in `engine.io@4.0.0`, so
previous releases are not impacted.

⚠️ This release contains an important security fix ⚠️

A malicious client could send a specially crafted HTTP request, triggering an uncaught exception and killing the Node.js process:

> RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear
>
> at Receiver.getInfo (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:176:14)
>
> at Receiver.startLoop (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:136:22)
>
> at Receiver.\_write (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:83:10)
>
> at writeOrBuffer (internal/streams/writable.js:358:12)

This bug was introduced by [this commit](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/f3c291fa613a9d50c924d74293035737fdace4f2), included in `engine.io@4.0.0`, so previous releases are not impacted.

Thanks to Marcus Wejderot from Mevisio for the responsible disclosure.

# Uncaught Exception in engine.io

High

[darrachequesne](/darrachequesne)
published
GHSA-273r-mgr4-v34f
Jan 12, 2022

## Package

npm

engine.io
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 4.0.0, <= 4.1.1
>= 5.0.0, <= 5.2.0
>= 6.0.0, <= 6.1.0

## Patched versions

4.1.2
5.2.1
6.1.1

## Description

### Impact

A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process.

> RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear
>
> at Receiver.getInfo (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:176:14)
>
> at Receiver.startLoop (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:136:22)
>
> at Receiver.\_write (/.../node\_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:83:10)
>
> at writeOrBuffer (internal/streams/writable.js:358:12)

This impacts all the users of the [`engine.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/engine.io) package starting from version `4.0.0`, including those who uses depending packages like [`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io).

### Patches

A fix has been released for each major branch:

| Version range | Fixed version |
| --- | --- |
| `engine.io@4.x.x` | `4.1.2` |
| `engine.io@5.x.x` | `5.2.1` |
| `engine.io@6.x.x` | `6.1.1` |

Previous versions (`< 4.0.0`) are not impacted.

For `socket.io` users:

| Version range | `engine.io` version | Needs minor update? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `socket.io@4.4.x` | `~6.1.0` | - |
| `socket.io@4.3.x` | `~6.0.0` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@4.4.x` |
| `socket.io@4.2.x` | `~5.2.0` | - |
| `socket.io@4.1.x` | `~5.1.1` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@4.4.x` |
| `socket.io@4.0.x` | `~5.0.0` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@4.4.x` |
| `socket.io@3.1.x` | `~4.1.0` | - |
| `socket.io@3.0.x` | `~4.0.0` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@3.1.x` or `socket.io@4.4.x` (see [here](https://socket.io/docs/v4/migrating-from-3-x-to-4-0/)) |

In most cases, running `npm audit fix` should be sufficient. You can also use `npm update engine.io --depth=9999`.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.
