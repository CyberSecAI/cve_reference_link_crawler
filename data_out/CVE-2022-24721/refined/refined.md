Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper authorization for internal usage of Oort and Seti channels within the CometD library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper access controls on Oort and Seti channels allows any remote user to subscribe and publish to these internal channels.
- Failure to restrict access to internal channels, leading to unauthorized data access and modification.
- CWE-285: Improper Authorization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** By subscribing to Oort and Seti channels, a remote user can monitor cluster-internal traffic, potentially exposing sensitive data from other users.
- **Integrity Violation:** By publishing to these channels, a remote user may be able to manipulate, create, or delete other users' data and alter the cluster's structure.
- Potential to impact cluster availability
