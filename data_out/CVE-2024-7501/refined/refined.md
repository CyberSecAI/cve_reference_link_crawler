**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `download_theme()` function of the "Download Plugins and Themes from Dashboard" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The attacker would need to trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a malicious link to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in administrator to click a link that makes a forged request.
