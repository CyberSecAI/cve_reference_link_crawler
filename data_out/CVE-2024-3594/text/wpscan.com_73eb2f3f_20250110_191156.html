## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# IDonate < 2.0.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to
http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=idonate-setting-admin
2. Enter payload `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` in Recaptcha secret key
and in Recaptcha Site key
3. Click on save changes.
4. XSS will trigger when a user access the settings
