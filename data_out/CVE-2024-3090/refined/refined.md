Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and encoding in the "Add Ambulance" functionality of the PHPGurukul Emergency Ambulance Hiring Portal 1.0. User-supplied data in the "Ambulance Reg No." and "Driver Name" fields are directly embedded into the HTML content without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Web Script Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Stealing user credentials and other sensitive information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input Fields: The attack vector is through the "Ambulance Reg No." and "Driver Name" input fields in the "Add Ambulance" functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to have an account with access to the "Add Ambulance" functionality (likely an admin role).
- No special network position is needed; the attack can be carried out remotely via the web interface.
