Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two issues in the Strapi framework:
1.  **Open Redirect:** The `/api/connect/:provider` endpoint allows a user-controlled `callback` parameter, which is used in the redirection process, without proper validation. This allows an attacker to redirect a user to an arbitrary external domain. The callback URL is stored in the `koa.sess` cookie.
2.  **Session Token in URL:** After successful authentication with a third-party provider, the access token is included as a URL query parameter (`access_token`) in the callback URL. This exposes the token to potential interception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unvalidated Input:** The application does not validate the `callback` URL parameter, allowing for open redirection.
2.  **Insecure Token Handling:** The application transmits the access token via the URL query parameter instead of using a more secure method like HTTP cookies or hidden form fields.
3. **Chained Vulnerabilities:**  The impact of the open redirect vulnerability is increased by the fact that the access token is passed in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An unauthenticated attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:

1.  **Steal 3rd-party Tokens:** By crafting a malicious URL with an attacker-controlled redirect target, they can redirect a user and capture the SSO token.
2.  **Bypass Authentication:** Using the stolen access token, the attacker can obtain a JWT token, allowing them to authenticate and access the Strapi application as the victim user.
3.  **Access Sensitive Data:** Once authenticated, the attacker can interact with the application's API and potentially access or modify sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious link that redirects to a controlled domain using the open redirect vulnerability. This link can be distributed via phishing emails or other means.
2.  **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click on the malicious link to trigger the open redirect and expose the token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the malicious link and receive the redirected request with the token.
2.  **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link.
3. **Basic Web Server:** The attacker needs to run a simple web server to receive the redirected user, retrieve the access_token and get the JWT token.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `packages/plugins/users-permissions/server/controllers/auth.js` file and `packages/plugins/users-permissions/server/routes/content-api/auth.js`.
*   The vulnerability affects Strapi versions `<= 4.24.1`.
*   The patch is included in version `4.24.2`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes a python script to demonstrate the exploit.
*   The `koa.sess` cookie stores the redirect URL, which is vulnerable to manipulation.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 7.1.
*   The identified CWEs are CWE-294 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input) and CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')).
