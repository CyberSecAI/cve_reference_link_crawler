Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2668:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2018-2668 in multiple sources, confirming its relevance. The descriptions also mention "mysql" and "mariadb" related vulnerabilities.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability is within the MySQL server's optimizer component. The specific nature of this vulnerability is not explicitly stated in most sources, but it is related to the optimizer component and is described as unspecified.
    *   One source states: "mysql: Server: Optimizer multiple unspecified vulnerabilities (CPU Jan 2018) (CVE-2018-2640, CVE-2018-2665, CVE-2018-2668)"
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: An unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL optimizer component.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: The impact of exploitation is not fully detailed but could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Most sources list the severity as moderate. Some describe it as "hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS)". One source lists the CVSS impact as High for availability.
    *   RedHat states in one advisory: "mysql: Server: Optimizer multiple unspecified vulnerabilities (CPU Jan 2018) (CVE-2018-2640, CVE-2018-2665, CVE-2018-2668)" with moderate severity.
    *   Another RedHat source describes it as "mysql: Server: Optimizer unspecified vulnerability (CPU Jan 2018) (CVE-2018-2668)" with a moderate security impact.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is generally through a network connection to the MySQL or MariaDB server. The exact method of triggering the vulnerability within the optimizer is unspecified.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Attackers need network access to the MySQL server to exploit the vulnerability. Some sources indicate the need for a user with a "low" privilege level, while others do not mention specific credentials.

**Additional Details (Compared to the Placeholder CVE Description):**

*   The sources provide more context by associating CVE-2018-2668 with other vulnerabilities affecting MySQL and MariaDB (CVE-2018-2562, CVE-2018-2622, CVE-2018-2640, CVE-2018-2665 etc). This indicates a cluster of vulnerabilities being addressed by the updates.
*   Several sources also explicitly name the affected versions (e.g., MySQL 5.5.58 and prior, MariaDB 10.0.35).

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-2668 is an unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL/MariaDB database server optimizer that can be exploited by an attacker with network access, potentially causing a denial-of-service. The provided sources highlight the need to update the database servers to mitigate the threat. The required attacker capabilities include network access, and potentially low level privileges. The root cause is in the optimizer, but specific exploit details are lacking.
