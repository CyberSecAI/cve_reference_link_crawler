<p> </p>
<h3>HikaShop 5.1.2</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Release date : November, 28 2024</strong></p>
<p style="padding-bottom:0.8em;line-height:1.5em;">
<a href="https://pastebin.com/mqfxzHKA" target="_blank">List of all the files changed between the 5.1.1 and the 5.1.2</a>
</p>
<h4>Bug fixes (24)</h4>

<li>In the cart / wishlist product edit popup, the values of characteristics in dropdown / radio mode were not translated.</li>
<li>Fedex doesn't support the oz weight unit, the plugin now convert oz weight to lb.</li>
<li>When a product had variants and tags setup to itself but not to its variants, the tags would appear on the product page, but as soon as you would change the selected variant, the tags would disappear.</li>
<li>When a product had a price and variants without a price set in them, the custom item field system would think the product is free and would not display the custom item fields on the product page with the "Display add to cart button for free products" setting deactivated.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue with the OpenCart import tool on PHP 8.2.</li>
<li>We fixed a warning with the checkout system on PHP 8.2.</li>
<li>The PayPal Express payment plugin now takes into account the payment fee even when the "send cart details" setting is turned off in the payment method settings.</li>
<li>With the "send order details" setting deactivated in the PayPal Checkout plugin, the total amount of the order would be sent to PayPal as tax instead of total amount.</li>
<li>We better escape the texts used by the javascript of the PayPal Checkout payment plugin so that it won't break with complex translation overrides.</li>
<li>An improvement we made recently to the Google Products plugin had the side effect of using relative image URLs instead of absolute URLs  in the XML feed.</li>
<li>Products listings would display an error on PHP 7 due to the changes made for the advance display of prices.</li>
<li>The "equal" / "not equal" on the "display limited to" setting of custom fields wouldn't work properly when different fields would be limited to the same parent with different selection of the "equal" / "not equal" dropdown.</li>
<li>HikaShop now skips the microdata if the product has no prices as Google doesn't accept products without prices.</li>
<li>We fixed PHP warnings on PHP 8 on the product details page when the product doesn't have any prices.</li>
<li>We fixed deprecated messages relative to thumbnails generation on PHP 8.2.</li>
<li>We fixed an error which could happen when Smart Search indexing is done via a cron task.</li>
<li>The geolocation plugin didn't work properly following the improvements made to it in the previous release.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue linked to the improvements we made to the geolocation plugin in the 5.1.1, which could result in the default country to be wrong on the registration form.</li>
<li>When not creating a menu item for the checkout, and without using the "force menu on checkout" setting, and with the Checkout SEF name customized, the URL generated to access the checkout would not work properly.</li>
<li>The tags display would display multiple times on the product details page when the product would have variants.</li>
<li>We've fixed an issue with support of the javascript of Joomla 3.x following changes we made to improve the support of the CSRF token for Joomla 4 and 5.</li>
<li>The taxes on the shipping fee is now based on the billing address and not the shipping address with the "Type of address used for tax" setting configured to "Billing address".</li>
<li>The column header was missing for the characteristics columns on the frontend products listing displayed with the "table" layout.</li>
<li>When a product was purchased in quantities of more than 1, only 1 was counted for calculating the shipping costs of the new FedEx shipping plugin.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improvements (38)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Social Networks plugin now adds the Open Graph meta tags retailer_item_id, availability and condition in order to provide more information on the products.</li>
<li>We changed the order_shipping_params column of the hikashop_order table from TEXT to LONGTEXT for new installations of HikaShop in order to allow for more information to be stored in there.</li>
<li>We've added strlen, mb_strlen, substr, mb_substr, trim, str__word_count and decimal functions to formula fields (like the formula field of shipping methods). That way, you can write complex formulas using these functions.</li>
<li>We've added support for Northen Ireland VAT numbers for Regex and online check.</li>
<li>We've increased the maximum number of filters possible in the filter selector of the HikaShop filter module from 50 to 100.</li>

<li>We improved the report system when counting sales of products.</li>
<li>Overriding frontend controllers is now possible.</li>
<li>We've improved the saving of custom fields with their "display limited to" setting configured. When the field doesn't appear on the form, the save process will clear the value already in the database for that field, if any. </li>
<li>We've improved the "shipping methods" restriction processing for custom order fields after the order is already created.</li>
<li>The debug mode of the new FedEx shipping plugin now includes more debug information.</li>
<li>We've added a distinct class to the contact button and the show details button on listings so that they are easier to target individually when adding custom CSS.</li>
<li>We've improved a bit the handling of custom item fields to avoid conflicts with deleted custom product fields with the same name.</li>
<li>We've improved the checkout in order to skip empty steps automatically.</li>
<li>We've added some extra checks to the user synchronisation plugin to avoid issues in some cases with the use of the cli.</li>
<li>We have optimized the management of webp images to have a more consistent rendering based on more cases.</li>
<li>The translation popup for custom fields has been improved to better handle special characters and HTML.</li>
<li>Developers can now override custom field type classes using the normal class override mechanism described in the developer documentation.</li>
<li>The trashed products are not counted anymore in the number of products of categories on the frontend.</li>
<li>We've added a cancel button to the PayPal Checkout end page so that the user can easily go back to the checkout if necessary.</li>
<li>The PayPal Checkout plugin now prefills the credit card billing address fields of the credit card form as much as possible even if some of the fields of the billing address are missing.</li>
<li>We changed the display of the error messages coming from Joomla during the login and registration on the checkout so that they always display with the "error" type (red) and not as warning or others so that the auto scroll system of the checkout can properly catch them to display them to the user. This will improve usability.</li>
<li>HikaShop now adds the additional fee key name to the params of the product in the order so that it is not lost when the order is created.</li>
<li>We made modifications to the loading of the parent categories in some areas of HikaShop to drastically speed up the processing with a lot of categories in the shop.</li>
<li>We've optimized the loading of categories for custom fields. It will take a lot less resources which will make a real difference if you have thousands of categories.</li>
<li>We improved the loading of auto loaded coupons to better select the most interesting one for the customer.</li>
<li>We improved the PayPal Checkout credit card form so that it can now display error messages if the payment has a problem on PayPal's end.</li>
<li>We've improved the error message of the PayPal Checkout payment plugin in order to support Joomla 3.</li>
<li>With the force redirect setting turned on, the filter module now doesn't take into account the current category of the menu item so that it always uses the main page of the menu item so that it can actually search on all the products.</li>
<li>The PayPal Checkout plugin will now update the pay later message on the product page based on the selected variant. That way, the message will stay relevant to the variant selected.</li>
<li>We've improved the handling of custom fields custom options saving (for plugins).</li>

<li>We made some modifications so that the background color on the rows of the order listing based on the order status of the orders work with the muta backend template.</li>
<li>We added a small delay to the height consistency check in case some things still need to be rendered on the page. This will allow for a more consistent result.</li>
<li>We added a span element around the product / category name on product / category listings displayed with the "list" mode so that they can be better targeted with CSS.</li>
<li>We made the necessary changes to the Paybox plugin in order to be compatible with v3.0 of the PayBox integration guide.</li>
<li>The address company and VAT number fields are now enabled by default on new installations of HikaShop. The VAT number will now be hidden by default and display automatically once the company field has been filled by the user (for new installations).</li>
<li>The columns mechanism on backend listing has been moved to local storage instead of cookies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New features (5)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We've added a new setting to the geolocation plugin so that you can tweak the caching period of the geolocation information in the database (1 year by default).</li>
<li>We've added several settings to the Google Products plugin in order to support more advanced capabilities:<br/>- Is bundle<br/>- Multipack<br/>- Energy efficiency class<br/>- Minimum energy efficiency class<br/>- Maximum energy efficiency class<br/>- Unit pricing measure<br/>- Unit pricing base measure<br/>- Availability date</li>
<li>HikaShop's checkout login now supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>HikaShop 5.1.1</h3>

<p style="padding-bottom:0.8em;line-height:1.5em;">
<a href="https://pastebin.com/AC4VyJeQ" target="_blank">List of all the files changed between the 5.1.0 and the 5.1.1</a>
</p>
<h4>Bug fixes (43)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We added a check to not display the back button on the page when displaying a menu item of the type "cart display" as it makes no sense to allow access to the control panel from there.</li>
<li>The address type could be lost on an address when editing from the frontend an address already used for a previous order.</li>
<li>We fixed a deprecated message on PHP 8.3 in some rare cases when displaying a product with variants on the frontend.</li>
<li>When the "Display add to cart button for free products" setting was turned on, and with a product with no price but with variants with prices, but no price on the default variant, the custom item fields would not display on the product page even if they should have. We've improved the check there so that it works properly.</li>
<li>We've fixed an error which could happen on non HikaShop pages when the cart notification plugin would hae been uninstalled by the shop owner.</li>
<li>We fixed a fatal error with the IP2Location.io integration in the geolocation plugin.</li>
<li>We fixed some warning messages which could happen when configuring the PayPal Checkout payment method based on what PayPal returned for the status of the merchant account.</li>
<li>When the "bought" attribute of a hkshow or hkhide tag would be used, the plugin would only take into account products with 2 sales and more, instead of 1 sale and more.</li>
<li>We fixed an error message display issue with the FedEx plugin.</li>
<li>The like button of the like plugin wouldn't be clickable with the zoom option activated on products listings.</li>
<li>We've added numerous fixes for the FedEx 2 shipping plugin.</li>
<li>We fixed some warnings with the new FedEx plugin.</li>
<li>We deactivated the auto submit of steps system on the checkout as it had too many side effects.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue with the new FedEx plugin which would create an error on PHP 8.2 when trying to create a new shipping method for it.</li>
<li>We fixed an error of packaging with the new Fedex shipping plugin.</li>
<li>On Joomla 5, adding to the cart the variant of a product with an access level not set to all the user groups while not being logged would lead to the variant not being added to the cart.</li>
<li>The add to cart process could generate an error message in some rare cases on PHP 8.2.</li>
<li>The checkout could auto submit the step when deleting or creating a new address in some rare cases.</li>
<li>The pagination of the carts listing in the backend didn't work properly when the search was used.</li>
<li>We fixed a deprecated message with the URL generation in some rare cases on recent versions of PHP.</li>
<li>The "Provide points instead of fees" setting, when activated, could generate an error when an order was created at the end of the checkout.</li>
<li>With the "thumbnails" setting turned off, the system would still use thumbnails on the product page when the product would have several images.</li>
<li>When "all" would be selected for the order status setting of limits, the past orders wouldn't be taken into account.</li>
<li>The billing address could be used in some cases even if the shipping address was selected as the type of address to be used for taxes.</li>
<li>The terms and conditions popup didn't display the article selected properly on Joomla 5.</li>
<li>We fixed a warning which could happen with order mass actions with an action "add product" where the product being added wouldn't have any price.</li>
<li>We fixed a warning which could happen on the products listing of the order details page in the backend with custom product fields displayed on it. The warning would display once the main product of a variant purchased in the order would be deleted.</li>
<li>We fixed a problem with the sorting of categories of filters when the categories don't have any ordering and the filter is configured to display several levels of categories.</li>
<li>For the support of variants for discounts to be possible, we had to have to add the discount on the price of the variant. However, at the point where this is done, the price of the variant can potentially be a copy of the price from the main product (if the variant doesn't have a price itself). And that price from the main product can already have a discount applied on it if the discount targets the main product. In such case, several discounts could be applied several times on the price of the variant while only one should apply. We made a modification so that when the system tries to add a discount to a price, it first checks if the price doesn't already have a discount applied. If so, it skips the process.</li>
<li>When using the "last week" period in a report, it would generate an error on PHP 8.2 and above when display the report, and the same error would also appear on the dashboard if the report would be published as a widget.</li>
<li>Following the addition of the new "equal to" / "not equal to" dropdown to the "display limited to" setting of custom fields, when several custom fields would be restricted to the same parent field, only the first one would be displayed / hidden properly.</li>
<li>Translation overrides for HIKASHOP_COUPON or HIKASHOP_PAYMENT with HTML in them would break the transaction request with Authorize.net.</li>
<li>We fixed an error which could happen on the orders listing in the backend after disabling a shipping plugin which was used by previous orders on PHP 8 and up.</li>
<li>The smart search plugin now properly handle deleted products when the "activate product recovery" setting is activated and the products end up in the trash instead of being really completely deleted.</li>
<li>When a filter on categories was restricted to a particular category, the filter wouldn't load the categories properly.</li>
<li>We modified the built-in plugins of the system group to make sure they only execute on the frontend and don't do anything on other requests like when the CLI is used.</li>
<li>We fixed some warnings with the structured data for products or variants without prices. </li>
<li>We fixed an issue with the old FedEx shipping plugin.</li>
<li>The filters on columns with the = and != operators on an empty value would be ignored in massactions.</li>
<li>The payment via PayPal account might not work in some cases with the ACDC option enabled.</li>
<li>The translation of the custom field label in the emails didn't work properly.</li>
<li>We fixed a MySQL query error which could happen in some rare cases with the Smart search plugin when saving a product from the backend interface.</li>
<li>An error message would popup on the HikaShop configuration for new installations of HikaShop regarding plugins not being installed even though there was no problem.</li>
<li>We fixed an error which could happen with the "instant capture" setting turned off in some rare cases with the PayPal Checkout plugin.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improvements (18)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We improved the update of the price without taxes when the user inputs his products price with taxes.</li>
<li>HikaShop now includes the HTTP header token of Joomla taken from the JS of Joomla if available during AJAX requests to avoid potential issues with the token being missing / outdated for one reason or another. It will improve resiliance in cases where caching is too agressive and such.</li>
<li>There is now a notice box poping up when you click on an email tag so that the user knows he can now paste the tag in the HTML editor.</li>
<li>We've improved the address saving in the user edit form of the HikaShop backend so that it properly display error messages when necessary.</li>
<li>The HikaShop Geolocation plugin now stores the IP address and its corresponding country code in the database after a successful request to a geolocation service. This way, before making a new query it will try to get the information from the database, saving resources and useless API requests.</li>
<li>It is now possible to use the ID of the product in the "bought" attribute of the hkshow and hkhide content tags.</li>
<li>We've added logging of failed VAT number online checks in the "payment log file" of HikaShop.</li>
<li>We added a label for the quantity dropdown of the pagination to help users with screen readers.</li>
<li>We made some improvements to the javascript handling the add to cart processing in order to better support template preview systems.</li>
<li>The CSV export action of mass actions now properly handle the order_product_price and order_product_tax columns as price columns. This means that the export takes into account the "CSV decimal separator" setting for them, similar to what it already does for columns like the order_full_price.</li>
<li>When a main product is published or unpublished, now all the variants of the product are also processed by the Smart Search in order for the status of their main product to be taken into account.</li>
<li>We added a "X-Robots-Tag: noindex" header to the AJAX requests refreshing the cart module. This should prevent search engines from trying to index these URLs.</li>
<li>We've optimized the category filter system on frontend products listings. In some cases, the gains can be a page load 5 times faster.</li>
<li>The content map type for indexed products on multilingual websites now contains the product type.</li>
<li>When the instant capture setting is turned off in the PayPal Checkout plugin, you had 3 days to capture the payment. We've made improvements in the payment plugin so that you now have up to 1 month to capture the funds.</li>
<li>By default, the HikaShop Cart module had all options by default set to No, that wasn't relevant, it's now adjusted.</li>
<li>We improved the look of multiple dropdown filters in order to use the fancy choicejs library included in Joomla 4 and 5, while still keeping the old chosen library on Joomla 3.</li>
<li>HikaShop will now automatically modify the current product's alias when saving a product and its alias is already used by another product. </li>
</ul>
<h4>New features (10)</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can now configure different Joomla tags for different variants of a product, and the tags will update on the product page when the user changes the selected variant.</li>
<li>We've added a new option to choose whether you want to filter the HTML of the product description in the backend. It is activated by default and thus, if you want to be able to add iframe tags or script tags in your products description, you'll have to turn off this setting.</li>
<li>We've added a new setting "Checkout link template" to the Google Products plugin. This will allow the plugin to directly provide the add to cart URL in the XML feed ( https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/13580733?sjid=2381062689629391492-NC ).</li>
<li>We've added a sorting option to the UPS OAuth shipping plugin so that you can have the shipping services sorted with the cheapest one first on the checkout.</li>
<li>We've added a new option to define which price input to display (with or without taxes) when adding a new price, this option is directly in the price product form.</li>
<li>The consistency height option in your menu items sees the arrival of a new option which allows, in addition to using the consistency height, to have the buttons always aligned to the bottom.</li>
<li>We've added a new option to the TaxCloud plugin so that you can Exempt some user accounts from taxes if they have their taxes waved (for government entities for example).</li>
<li>We've added a new event when additionals (fees) are removed from the cart. This event is called onAfterCartRemoveAdditional</li>
<li>Since Joomla 5.1, the backend can be change between dark or light theme with a switcher module. HikaShop integrates with it so that the page refreshes in order to take this into account properly.</li>
<li>We've added advanced price display customization settings to the HikaShop products and categories listing menu items and the HikaShop content module. That way, you can potentially customize the prices display in much more details with an interface and potentially some translation overrides, without having to modify PHP code in view overrides.</li>

<li>We've fixed the display of the file / image uploaded for custom fields of the type "AJAX file" or "AJAX image" with their "multiple" setting turned off.</li>

We've also added a hidden setting report_csv_filename_format if you want to customize the filename. You'll be able to use the tags {widget_name} {date} and {time} to set the filename format you want.</li>
<li>We removed the HikaShop history plugin from the HikaShop install package as it wasn't used anymore.</li>

<li>It is now possible to provide different images for each language for the products and categories using translation overrides. For example, if the file is called "my file.jpg", you can have an override like MYFILEJPG="mon fichier.jpg" and upload the file to the upload folder of HikaShop in images/com_hikashop/upload/ via FTP to swap the image based on the language being used.</li>
<li>We've added trimming on the values of custom fields when saving them to reduce typing mistakes.</li>

<li>We've improved the activation link display in the user account email sent to the customer after the registration when the self activation is actived in the options of the Joomla user manager.</li>
<li>We've made it possible to directly use translation keys in the original fields, even with the "non-latin translation keys" setting activated in the HikaShop configuration.</li>

<h4>Bug fixes (45)</h4>

<li>We removed the Google Analytics plugin from HikaShop Business. The API it uses is not supported anymore by Google Analytics. Users should use instead the Google Analytics plugin available for free on our marketplace.</li>

<li>We've improved the CSV import to better handle CSV files with only one column.</li>
<li>We have updated the twitter icon for the new X version (and follow the new color code as well).</li>

</ul>
<h4>New features (9)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We take into account Joomla 5.1's color scheme option in the Atum backend template.</li>
<li>We've added Google structured data as json-ld to the product details page. This will allow us to provide more complete and complex data to search engines regardless of the HTML of the product details page. Thanks to this, the structured data as json-ld on the details page can now contain variants data when the product has variants. That structured data also complies with the settings of the Google Products plugin so that what is provided in the product XML feed and what search engines see on the product details page when crawling it matches. </li>
<li>We've added an event onBeforeOptionDisplay(&$element, &$optionElement, &$option_values, &$value) which allows plugins to interface with the options display on the product page. It can, for example, be used to add or remove choices in the options on the fly.</li>
<li>The "Product SEF name" and "Category SEF name" settings can now accept a translation key so that the translation for the current language will be used for the URLs generated for the products / categories.</li>
<li>The smart search plugin now takes into account variants of products.</li>
<li>In the MySQL query of the data of custom fields, it's now possible to use the tags {user_id} or {id} or {username} or {user_email} in order for them to be replaced automatically based on the data of the current user.</li>
<li>We've added a new option "Backend color scheme" to the HikaShop configuration so that you can potentially force the Light mode or the Dark mode in case the backend template you're using is not Atum.</li>
<li>The Smart Search integration now supports Falang.</li>
<li>The registration override content now supports content tags.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<li>When a product filter on the frontend is displaying categories from several levels, the system will now automatically sort them based on the ordering of the categories made in the backend.</li>
<li>We have improved the swiper (carousel) view code to better manage the different possible configurations and have a display that better corresponds to cases.</li>
<li>We have add another "insert" button in the product content tag popup, for ergonomic purposes.</li>
<li>We've added back the icon for the product content tag plugin.</li>
<li>We've improved the display of the quantity input in table mode.</li>
<li>We now automatically deactivate the "synchronized add to cart" mode on products listings with the "global on listing" mode as it doesn't make sense.</li>
<li>We improved the resilience of the SEF routing so as to keep the view and layout parameters in the SEFed URLs if the Itemid parameter is missing from the list of paramaters provided by Joomla (it should not normally happen).</li>
<li>You can now change the name of an empty wishlist if the access to empty wishlists is allowed with the cart_show_page_redirect_on_empty hidden setting.</li>
<li>We improved the download links generation for orders when several download links need to be generated and different elements need to load the order on the same page.</li>
<li>We improved the users synchronization process in HikaShop so that even if Joomla users are deleted without going through the Joomla interface, and the id of the user is reattributed by Joomla to another user account, HikaShop will still properly keep the synchronization.</li>
<li>We improved the menu item check on the URLs generated from the backend so that it doesn't take into account the user groups of the current user.</li>
<li>The Google Products plugin now also supports weight provided in your products in kilos.</li>
<li>The installation/update process now automatically adds the update site to HikaShop's XML on the fly so that the "rebuild" button of the Joomla update sites manager doesn't delete HikaShop's update site.</li>

</ul>
<h4>New features (6)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We've added the event onAfterConfigLoad(&$values) to the loading of settings. This can allow plugins to dynamically modify settings of HikaShop.</li>
<li>We've added a hidden setting with the namekey threshold_stock_message to be able to change the threshold (defaults to 1) between displaying the "1 item in stock" and the "X items in stock message".

<li>We improved the filters on the views listing in the backend.</li>
<li>We've added an option "Other clients also bought" to the "relation" setting of products listing modules so that you can now easily display a listing of products bought by previous customers who purchased the current product on its product details page.</li>
<li>We've added a new setting "include variants" in the Google Products plugin so that the XML feed generated by the plugin can properly support product variants.</li>
<li>We added an alias field to shipping methods and payment methods so that you can define specific text for your own reference on listings in the backend.</li>
</ul>

<h3>HikaShop 5.0.2</h3>

<a href="https://pastebin.com/YSCk43Af" target="_blank">List of all the files changed between the 5.0.1 and the 5.0.2</a>
</p>
<h4>Bug fixes (1)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We fixed a stored XSS trough SVG file upload security issue. <a href="https://github.com/SonNguyen3496/Mitre_opensource_report/blob/main/hika-xss.md">You can read more about it here</a>.<br/>
Note that it only affects HikaShop versions above the 4.6.2 up to the 5.0.1 and not if you updated HikaShop from previous versions as default support of SVG images for the upload of images was only added in the 4.7.0 for new installations of HikaShop. Also, it requires access to the backend of the website to perform, and can be avoided easily by removing the possibility of uploading svg files in the HikaShop configuration's "allowed images" setting or updating your HikaShop to the 5.0.2.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

When turned off, the add to cart will redirect to the checkout if successful, or refresh the whole page if there is an error to display.</li>
<li>We've added a new UPS plugin for the new UPS OAuth 2.0 API. The previous UPS plugin is deprecated and won't work anymore after the 3rd of June 2024. So we invite you to switch to this new shipping plugin. It is included, for free, in all the editions of HikaShop.</li>

<li>When using the HikaShop cart notification plugin in "popup" mode, the plugin would load the notify-metro.css file on the pages even though it is not necessary.</li>

<li>Filters with their "dynamic display" setting turned on will now keep their values once they are used until the filters are reset.</li>
<li>We improved the prices section of the product edit form to make it more obvious that you need to enter the price of the product in the prices listing and not in the retail price setting.</li>

<p style="padding-bottom:0.8em;line-height:1.5em;">
<a href="https://pastebin.com/tGqivymT" target="_blank">List of all the files changed between the 4.7.2 and the 4.7.3</a>
</p>
<h4>Bug fixes (20)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>We fixed a SQL injection vulnerability which could allow access to data from the database from the backend order edition area. Please update your HikaShop if you're using an older version of HikaShop.</strong></li>
<li>When two discounts had the same percentage / flat amount, and were configured the same way, and a third party plugin would filter out the discounts based on extra settings not known to HikaShop, it could lead to HikaShop not seeing discounts it was supposed to see. This could happen for example with the vendor restriction on discounts when HikaShop would be integrated with HikaMarket Multivendor.</li>
<li>Changing the quantity of a product in the cart in really rare cases could lead to an "access forbidden" error.</li>
<li>We fixed a warning on PHP 8.1 with the add to cart button display on the variants listing on the product page in the frontend.</li>

<li>Joomla 4.3 changed the form validator javascript and we now have to provide the ID of a form element and not anymore the ID of a container which can be a form or not. Previous versions of HikaShop were providing the ID of the div around the registration form on the checkout. We now provide the ID of the checkout form element to prevent a javascript error in the validator code.</li>
<li>We now properly retreive the alias from the main product when indexing variants with the smart search.</li>

<li>The selected characteristic values could be missing on the waitlist form in some cases.</li>
<li>When all the prices of a product would be restricted to user groups not linked to the current user, and the user would use a sort filter with, among the choices, price sorting, if the user selected another sorting than price, the product would not appear in the sorted products listing evne though it should.</li>
<li>We fixed some deprecated messages on PHP 8.1 when creating new filters in the backend.</li>
<li>The ratio calculations in "proportion" mode could result in wrong ratios when products had variants, leading to a wrong tax calculated in some rare cases with several tax rates in the same order.</li>
<li>The cart notify plugin would redirect to the checkout even when the add to cart was failed when the popup mode was used with the redirect on success option activated.</li>
<li>We improved the compatibility between the infinite scroll and the filters system.</li>
<li>We've fixed several deprecated issues with PHP 8.1 on the new payment method form.</li>
<li>When filtering on the orders listing would result in no orders being found, it could result in some cases in a MySQL error.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Improvements (3)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We improved the filter system dynamic refresh mechanism to avoid failing when there is a javascript error in the HTML returned by the server.</li>
<li>If the last step of the checkout is empty, and the user arrives on it, the system will now automatically move to the order creation process.</li>
<li>The non-selected values of "dynamic display" filters will now be still available for selection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>HikaShop 4.7.1</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Release date : January, 20 2023</strong></p>
<p style="padding-bottom:0.8em;line-height:1.5em;">
<a href="https://pastebin.com/ranCB1GJ" target="_blank">List of all the files changed between the 4.7.0 and the 4.7.1</a>
</p>
<h4>Bug fixes (43)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We improved the compatibility between the translation system, the canonical URLs and the language switcher of Joomla by clearing the translation of the current language before loading the translations of another language. That way, even if a translation is available in one language and not in another, it will still work fine.</li>
<li>When running a mass action with an export action, if some of the elements wouldn't have all the information available, it could generate warning messages. For example, if you were exporting orders and exporting columns from the Joomla user account, and some of the orders had the user account of the customer deleted from the website, it would generate a warning for these users columns during the export.</li>
<li>The "format" setting of custom fields of the type "text" didn't work properly when used for custom fields of the tables "address", "item" or "order".</li>
<li>The restrictions on products / categories for custom contact fields didn't work properly when the custom fields were required.</li>
<li>When the "force redirect" setting was activated in the Filters module, the current category would be ignored to display the filters on the page even when the page was a product listing where it should be taken into account.</li>
<li>On a frontend products listing, when selecting "none" for brand filter it could, in some cases, not display any products instead of displaying the products regardless of the brand.</li>
<li>The price with options might not refresh when an option would be selected with radios in some cases following recent improvements to support multiple prices in options based on the quantity purchased.</li>
<li>If someone wrote some text for the stripes color, it could generate deprecated messages. We now properly handle that as transparent.</li>
<li>We've added a fix for PHP 8 during the export action of mass actions.</li>
<li>The support of the login social button for Joomla 4 would previously create an error on PHP 5.</li>
<li>We've fixed a warning on PHP 8 when accessing a products listing page without going through a menu item (so without the menu item alias in the URL).</li>
<li>When using HTML tags in the product name translations and then editing the translations of the products via the translation popup of the product edit form, the text wouldn't be escaped properly leading to the loss of the translation text with the HTML in it.</li>
<li>In some special conditions, using some payment plugins and HikaMarket, it would be possible to generate an error during the confirmation of the order on PHP 8.</li>
<li>The notification boxes could sometimes appear below elements of the interface.</li>
<li>We fixed a warning which could happen when editing a variant while having custom fields of the table "product" and of the type "custom text".</li>
<li>When coupons with the "quota per user" setting set were used together with the Multi Coupon plugin, it would generate an error in the checkout.</li>
<li>The new tax mechanism when editing orders in the 4.7.0 didn't work properly when no taxes was applied on the amounts being changed.</li>
<li>We fixed warnings which could come up on PHP 8 on the product edit form in the backend with products with variants with missing sorting data.</li>
<li>When using setting the "sub element filter" setting of a menu/module to "group by categories" for a listing of product with the "main category" set to the main vendor category, the products wouldn't be found unless they were both linked to the sub category and the main vendor category. We fixed this so that it is not necessary, as it was already the case for normal categories.</li>
<li>Once a cart was emptied, and if you added to the cart a product with variants where the main product was restricted by user group and you were logged in, it was possible the add to cart would be refused due to the system not properly retrieving the current user id.</li>
<li>The delete icon of coupons with the multicoupon plugin didn't work properly in some cases.</li>
<li>We fixed an error which could happen with PHP 8 when the tax rate of a coupon would be different than the tax rate of the products in the cart (a situation which should normally not happen).</li>
<li>We fixed a deprecated message when sending an email in some rare cases on PHP 8.1</li>
<li>We've added a little adjustement to avoid broken image icon for when the Shop address image setting is left empty.</li>
<li>We removed the trigger of the events onPrepareModuleList, onAfterModuleList and onAfterCleanModuleList when loading the modules under the product page as it was causing more problems than anything with some templates.</li>
<li>The check to hide empty filters on the frontend didn't work in some cases.</li>
<li>We've added a little javascript fix for the open/close category explorer in the backend.</li>
<li>The minimum quantity and maximum quantity settings of coupons were not working properly in some cases.</li>
<li>When unpublishing several products or categories at the same time from the backend listings, the onAfterProductUpdate event would be triggered for each product but the $element passed would each time be the first product/category.</li>
<li>When having only custom order fields of the types radio/checkbox without any default value selected, even if the fields were required the system would skip the check if nothing was selected in any of them.</li>
<li>Following recent improvements to the options system, product options displayed as checkbox or radio wouldn't work properly in some cases.</li>
<li>We've added a patch to avoid the current menu item's main category from being lost when loading the filters when the menu item would be translated with Falang. This could lead to filters restricted to categories to not appear on the page.</li>
<li>The shipping and payment taxes were not taken into account properly when saving the changes with the new interface of the order management.</li>
<li>Some templates would customize wrongly the radio and checkbox custom fields due to the classes changes we made in the 4.7.0. So we've made a change to avoid the issue.</li>
<li>There was a problem with a translation key of the nl-NL translation file which would lead to an error on PHP8.</li>
<li>When the product name would be too long it would generate an error with the PayPal Checkout payment plugin. </li>
<li>We've fixed some issues with price comparisons on the checkout with shipping / payment methods on PHP8.</li>
<li>We've added a patch to postpone the user synchronization during the HikaShop registration so that it is done by the registration process, and not the user synchronization plugin, and thus includes the custom user field data when triggering the onAfterUserCreate event.</li>
<li>We've improved the robustness of the translation mechanism, especially when the original text strarts with a number.</li>
<li>The generation of thumbnails could, in some cases generate a deprecated message on PHP 8.1</li>
<li>In some rare cases, after products from a warehouse would be removed from the cart, the checkout would require a new validation of the shipping method selection before allowing the finishing of the checkout process.</li>
<li>We've fixed a warning with the language switcher on PHP 8 which could happen in some cases.</li>
<li>The geolocation plugin could generate a warning when the country of someone would be disabled in HikaShop or if the country code returned by the geolocation service would not be found in hikashop.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improvements (21)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We improved the error handling when saving a user to the database to display a proper message when trying to change the email address for one which is already used by another user entry.</li>
<li>When the user clicks on the "new" button of the wishlist listing, we now stay on the same page instead of directing to the "URL where to redirect when the cart is empty", as it makes more sense.</li>
<li>We've added some extra checks during the checkout to make sure the addresses being selected have all their required fields properly filled, even if they were filled before new required custom fields were added.</li>
<li>We improved the error handling on the contact form when a custom field is not properly filled. Before, the user would have to re-enter everything and he would get an error on the email address even if he had filled it. Now, he won't have to re-enter everything and he won't have an error on the email address if filled.</li>
<li>We made the limit periods translatable and translated them in French and Japanese. We translated the weight units in Japanese.</li>
<li>The options of modules included in HikaShop are now translatable and translated in French and Japanese.</li>
<li>The content of the add to cart HTML button popup is now displayed as a view so that you can create an override for it if you need to customize it.</li>
<li>We changed the alignment of the quantity input incorrect warnings so that they display better on mobile devices.</li>
<li>We've updated the header for the "Orders this month" to "Sales past 30 days" in the dashboard in order to better reflect what is being displayed.</li>
<li>We've improved the display of the status of downloads on the downloads listing on the frontend so that represents better the situation of the download, especially for some cases.</li>
<li>We've added the support of the Robots setting of menu items of the type cart listing, cart page, registration page, contact page, order listing, user control panel, and address manager.</li>
<li>New shipping method image added for Posteitaliane.</li>
<li>We've improved the payment and shipping views of the checkout so that if they are alone in their own step and that no shipping or no payment is required (because the order has only virtual goods, or the total amount is 0), the step will be skipped automatically to lead the customer to the next step of the checkout workflow.</li>
<li>We improved the saving mechanism for the product form customization so that it can handle fields being displayed or not based on the user group and other criteria.</li>
<li>We've added an horizontal scrolling capability to the backend screens so that if the content needs a bigger width (like the order status listing page on small screens) it will allow you to scroll to see everything instead of going outside of the area.</li>
<li>You can now use drag & drop to reorder the characteristic values easily in the HikaShop backend.</li>
<li>It is now possible to add HTML in the "Format" setting of currencies. This can potentially allow you to separate the price and the currency inside different spans with a format like this for example: &lt;span class="symbol"&gt;€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="price"&gt;%!n&lt;/span&gt;</li>
<li>Publish & unpublish button listing have now css dress up in order to have colors (UX).</li>
<li>We've added a new order status "returned" by default.</li>
<li>We've removed the swf extension as default file extensions allowed for new installations of HikaShop as it has become obsolete.</li>
<li>We now automatically delete the administrator/components/com_hikashop/extensions folder at the end of the installation process as we don't need it anymore. This also avoid reinstalling old plugins which are not included in HikaShop anymore.</li>
<li>We've improved the default look of the buttons in the popup notification after an add to cart.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New features (8)</h4>
<ul>

<li>We've added new columns hidden by default to the products listing in the backend.</li>
<li>We've added a new option "check on add to cart" to the shop closed hours plugin. It allows you to directly cancel the add to cart of products if the shop is currently closed.</li>
<li>We've added triggers onBeforeMassactionFilter and onBeforeMassactionProcess in the mass action system so that plugins can cancel actions, remove filters, add extra filters while a mass action is being run.</li>
<li>You can now select the fields you want to be indexed in the Smart Search plugin settings, allowing you to index custom fields and other data of the products which were ignored by the Smart Search so far.</li>
<li>We added a new feature that allow you to hide or display columns in your backend listings. This will also allow us to add extra hidden columns which can be displayed with the tick of a checkbox for merchants who need them without having too many columns displayed by default.</li>
<li>We've added a new option to the login block of the checkout workflow to be able to override the registration form with custom text/html.</li>

<li>The generation of thumbnails could, in some cases generate a deprecated message on PHP 8.1</li>
<li>In some rare cases, after products from a warehouse would be removed from the cart, the checkout would require a new validation of the shipping method selection before allowing the finishing of the checkout process.</li>
<li>We fixed the compatibility between the Shipping Estimation plugin and the Australia Post v2 shipping plugin. </li>
<li>We fixed an error on the frontend which could happen when the minimum quantity per order configured in the product would be higher than the maximum quantity per order and the product's quantity input would be configured as "show select" (a dropdown).</li>

<li>The label of the image width in the menu item options had been wrongly changed to the block layout label of the option above it.</li>
<li>The fix added in HikaShop 4.6.2 to properly load the overrides for controllers and classses could result, in some rare cases in the wrong template being loaded on some pages of the frontend when the geolocation plugn would be used with its "after initialize" setting being activated.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Improvements (35)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We've improved the robustness of the translation mechanism, especially when the original text strarts with a number.</li>
<li>It is now possible to add HTML in the "Format" setting of currencies. This can potentially allow you to separate the price and the currency inside different spans with a format like this for example: &lt;span class="symbol"&gt;€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="price"&gt;%!n&lt;/span&gt;</li>
<li>We've added an horizontal scrolling capability to the backend screens so that if the content needs a bigger width (like the order status listing page on small screens) it will allow you to scroll to see everything instead of going outside of the area.</li>
<li>We've added a new order status "returned" by default.</li>
<li>The publish & unpublish buttons on backend listings now have colors.</li>
<li>The Google Products plugin's menu item setting now uses a menu item selector instead of an input field in order to make it easier for the user to choose a menu item for the plugin.</li>
<li>The "Redirect Joomla registration to HikaShop plugin"'s setting is now a menu item selector instead of an input field so that you can more easily choose a menu item for it instead of having to search for the id of the menu item in the Joomla menu manager. We've also improved the tooltip for that setting to properly explain what the setting does.</li>
<li>We've changed the order of loading so that shipping plugins are loaded before payment plugins so that shipping plugins can cancel an order creation before a payment plugin could potentially process a payment.</li>
<li>We've added a new event onBeforeUserListing for the user listing in the backend. This will allow plugins to be able to modify the MySQL query loading the users there and add extra filters on the listing page, similarly to what's already possible on the orders listing.</li>
<li>The cart view of the Checkout workflow editor is now on two columns as it now has a lot of options. Incidentally, plugins adding extra blocks can now have their options in two columns with the "separator" type.</li>
<li>We improved the check database mechanism so that it works fine when plugins add new columns to the database during an update.</li>
<li>We've modified the class of the area for the additionals in the notification emails so that it's now possible to add CSS for only one additional without affecting the others.</li>
<li>The Google Products plugin now automatically provide the sale_price in the XML if a discount is applied on the price of the product. That way, Google will get both the price without discount and the price with discount and will be able advertise the products as being on sale.</li>
<li>We now force the capture of the money in "test mode" with the WorldPay Business gateway to make it easier to test payments with it.</li>
<li>It's now possible to use hikashop_getLayout for the layout of a hikashop plugin.</li>
<li>The close button for error messages on the frontend now also support Bootstrap 5.</li>
<li>We improved the error handling in the PayPal Checkout payment plugin.</li>
<li>We added extra data to the cart.empty javascript event so that developers can know what has been changed in the cart when it is emptied.</li>
<li>We've added a hidden option "form_custom" to be able to disable the form custom mechanism on the product edit page in case you don't need it and it create some problems.</li>
<li>The geolocation plugin is now deactivated by default to avoid doing useless processing on the pages when not necessary.</li>
<li>When the cart is being modified on the checkout, we now provide the data of the modified products to the javascript event so that third party javascript can use it.</li>
<li>We changed the "none" text of the tax category setting of variants to "as parent product" to better reflect the behavior of the system.</li>
<li>We now always display the thumbnails for the listing block layouts with "image" in their name, even if the "thumbnails" setting of the HikaShop configuration is turned off.</li>
<li>We've added the Central Bank of Russia in the list of available exchange rates feeds of the HikaShop rates auto update plugin.</li>
<li>We now force the creation of the address format override if missing in the template as long as it is different from the default in HikaShop. That way, when you change the template, as long as you save the HikaShop configuration once, it will add the address format override for it, instead of letting you believe it did while it didn't do it.</li>
<li>We've added a failsafe for the loading of the JavaScript libraries on Joomla 4 so that if something tries to load them before the web asset manager is loaded, it will wait to load them later on.</li>
<li>We've added the support for brands restriction for discounts.</li>
<li>Payment and shipping plugins can now have tooltips added to their options.</li>
<li>We've added a new event onGetCartProductsInfo(&$cart, &$ret) so that plugins can pass custom information to the javascript when responding to an add to cart AJAX request or a cart update AJAX request.</li>
<li>We changed the type of the field_default column in the hikashop_field table so that you can now write a text bigger than 255 characters in the default setting of custom fields.</li>
<li>We've improved the look of the PayPal Checkout buttons at the end of the checkout.</li>
<li>The RedShop import is not compatible with RedShop 3 (it would require writing a whole new import) so we've updated the text of the interface in HikaShop to reflect that.</li>
<li>We've added a "position" and an "icon" attributes to the additional deletable parameter so that plugins adding additionals to the cart can choose the placing of the delete icon and the icon to use.</li>
<li>We added the taxation_id of the created tax rule for the onAfterTaxationCreate event so that plugins can more easily act upon a tax rule creation.</li>
<li>The password checks now also support the "minimum lowercase" setting and also checks for spaces at the beginning or end and check the max length to replicate all of Joomla's new checks.</li>
<li>We've added jpeg, svg and webp as default file extensions allowed for new installations of HikaShop.</li>
<li>We've removed the swf extension as default file extensions allowed for new installations of HikaShop as it has become obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New features (9)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We've added a new "format" option for custom fields of the type "text", "textarea" and "WYSIWYG" so that you can prepend/append text around the value provided in the field when displaying the value of the field. This can be quite useful. For example, if you want to display a tracking URL in your emails, you can use a custom order field where you just provide the tracking number and use that format setting to add the HTML of the link around the tracking number.</li>
<li>We've reworked the order additional information edit popup so that it is clear what each input field is for and also improved the price / tax fields so that it is easier to use, without the need to manually calculate taxes.</li>
<li>We've updated the order product create/edit form popup on the order details page of the backend. We removed the tax input field and added instead a "price with tax" setting. That way, you don't have to manually calculate the tax when you want another price than the price by default. We also automatically calculate the price with tax based on the price without tax and the tax rate selected and vice-versa.</li>
<li>When options have several prices for different minimum quantities, the system will dynamically refresh the price displayed in the option dropdown/radio and will now also take it into account for the "price with options" display based on the quantity entered by the user in the quantity input field.</li>
<li>We've added a new option "Funding" to the PayPal checkout plugin so that you can select the payment methods you would like to be available to your customers if eligible (like Pay Later, bancontact, etc).</li>
<li>The input and select elements on the frontend now use the classes of Joomla 4 when using Joomla 4 instead of HikaShop's custom classes. We've made a system using constants which can be overridden either with options from the HikaShop configuration or plugins with the new event onHikashopDefineConstants.</li>
<li>The password fields on the different registration forms of HikaShop now display similarly to Joomla 4, with the requirement meter.</li>
<li>We have added new templates to allow you to change colors of your HikaShop emails, and select a new design to match your website style without having to modify the CSS of the emails default template.</li>
<li>We have add a new options to allow to add icon in the cart module view.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>Improvements (43)</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to use the lowest tax rate for shipping fees.</li>
<li>The brand selector on the product edit page now displays as a tree as brands can be in several levels.</li>
<li>There is a new option to the FedEx shipping method to select the environment.</li>

<li>The privacy consent integration now supports the "menu item" mode.</li>
<li>We changed the default "Frequency of the check for the carts" for new installations from 1 days to 20 minutes so that even on websites with many carts created by users, the system can still keep up with deleting the old carts.</li>
<li>Seletable filters will now be automatically hidden from display when there is no value to select in them.</li>
<li>We now display boolean custom fields following Joomla 4's style on Joomla 4.</li>
<li>We've added the support of the privacy consent plugin to the registration form displayed when you click on the link to register in the order notification emails after you placed an order as a guest if the corresponding option is activated.</li>
<li>We've added an "empty the cart" button to the cart detail page.</li>
<li>We've added "product_files" and "product_images" as reserved field column names as they are used internally and would create problems if used for a custom field.</li>
<li>Plugins can now add extra fields on the characteristic edit form in the backend.</li>
<li>The checkout login view will now display Joomla 4's social buttons (login with Google, Facebook, WebAuth, etc) mechanism. That way, users don't have to go through the registration procedure if social buttons are available (for example if they are added by Akeeba SocialLogin extension: https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/akeeba-sociallogin/ )</li>
<li>Payment plugin developers can now add an attribute "needCallbackFile" to their plugin class to have a callback file automatically created for them at the root of the website and they can use $this->getCallbackFilename() to get the filename. This can be used when the payment gateway restricts the number of characters or some special characters like ?, & or = for the callback URL for the payment notification. That way, when that callback file is called, it will automatically trigger their plugin's onPaymentNotification function.</li>
<li>We added a canonical URL header to the contact form page to make sure it's not flagged as duplicate content.</li>
<li>The orders created with taxes calculated by the TaxCloud plugin can now be modified in the HikaShop backend without loosing the tax information calculated by TaxCloud.</li>
<li>When the "synchronized add to cart" setting is activated in the HikaShop configuration is activated, you can directly update the quantity of the product from the "add to cart" button area on products listings and product details pages. So far even when reducing the quantity of the product in the cart, the notification box message would be "Product successfully added to the cart". We improved the system so that when the quantity is reduced it says instead "Product successfully removed from the cart" in order to improve user experience.</li>
<li>There is now a link back to the product details page on the product name of the product contact form.</li>
<li>If the stock of one of the selected options is not enough (or another limitation is hit for it), if the "group options with product" setting is activated in the HikaShop configuration, the add to cart of the whole product will be cancelled.</li>
<li>We've added the SameSite attribute to the cart and session cookies to avoid a warning to be displayed in the console of FireFox.</li>
<li>We now separate the "save" and the "save and close" buttons in the backend on Joomla 4 instead of having them stacked.</li>
<li>We've added logging capabilities to the "AIM" mode of the Authorize.net payment plugin.</li>
<li>We now allow HTML tags in the footer of the PDF generated by the PDF invoice plugin.</li>
<li>We've improved the code loading the custom fields on products listing to avoid errors with custom code in some rare cases.</li>
<li>We added a decimal to the exchange rate for new installations of HikaShop to be able to handle 6 decimals instead of 5.</li>
<li>We've added a hidden setting called  redirect_url_when_registration_form_access_while_already_logged so that you can override the URL where the user will be redirected if he tries to access the HikaShop registration form while already logged in.</li>
<li>When the multilanguage edit mechanism is activated, for languages other than English, when HikaShop is being initialized, we now reload all the already loaded translation files without the English overrides so that English translation overrides don't interfer with the original texts of the HikaShop content when the base language of the content is another language than English.</li>
<li>The PayFast payment plugin included in HikaShop has been removed from HikaShop's install package. PayFast offers their own version of the plugin and it conflicts with it. People already using our version will still be able to continue using it even after updating their HikaShop. But new installations of HikaShop won't have the plugin added anymore and they'll be able to get it from PayFast.</li>
<li>We've added a new javascript event hkCustomFieldChanged which will be triggered when a custom field is modified.</li>
<li>Changing custom item fields on the product details page now triggers the hkContentChanged javascript event.</li>
<li>Plugins can now inject headers into emails in the onBeforeMailPrepare event by adding their headers to $mail->extraHeaders.</li>
<li>We've removed the SEO fields from the translation popup of variants as they don't make sense there.</li>
<li>We've added extra data display to the user edit form on the backend so that plugins can add extra elements to that interface.</li>
<li>We've improved the javascript loading mechanism so that on Joomla 4, it will skip it if the web asset manager has not yet been initialized by Joomla.</li>
<li>We've improved the categories filters so that if no category is selected, we still only display product categories in the filter as it doesn't make sense to display other category types.</li>
<li>It is now possible to configure transparent stripes for image thumbnails.</li>
<li>We improved the email history rendering of the emails to properly display images when added to the email as background-image.</li>
<li>We removed the "add new value" button for the "default" setting of custom fields as it doesn't work properly and is not necessary there.</li>
<li>We added an error message if the admin tries to use the "allow new value" setting while using his own MySQL query to load the values of a custom field as that's not possible.</li>
<li>We improved the reminder plugin so that for cart reminders the plugin takes into account the last modification date of orders (and not only the creation date) and to also use the "cart waiting period" as a buffer so that if an order was created/modified for that user less than that period of time (1 day by default) before the last cart modification we also don't send a reminder.</li>
<li>We've added a "make this address default" checkbox to the address form on the checkout when necessary to make it easier for the user and avoid having to go to the address manager to change the default address.</li>
<li>We've added some failsafe for reports not properly initialized in order to not get an error when editing the report.</li>
<li>We added a patch for the compatibility with 4SEF (successor of SH404SEF).</li>
<li>HikaShop will now trigger the events onPrepareModuleList, onAfterModuleList and onAfterCleanModuleList for the modules loaded under the product page so that other extensions, like Advanced Modules Manager can process them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New features (7)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The translation mechanism now supports non latin languages for the original language with a new setting for it under the Languages tab of the HikaShop configuration.</li>
<li>The UPS plugin has a new option to be able to select between the production environment and the test environment.</li>
<li>We've added the "Sofinco" bank to the PayBox payment plugin.</li>
<li>The variants can now have their own tax category, overriding the main product's.</li>

<li>We've added an extra check so that you cannot configure the same path for the "upload folder" and the "upload secure folder" settings of the HikaShop configuration. This will prevent accidentally loosing access to all your images on the website.</li>
<li>We now display a nicer message when you access your order listing on the frontend and there are no orders found.</li>
<li>The "only with products" setting of category listings now also take into account the "access level" setting of the products.</li>
<li>We have slightly modified the product order listing plugin available for free on our Marketplace in order to work with the new drag & drop BE product feature.</li>
<li>Brands won't be listed anymore in the "categories" setting of the product edit form since only categories should be selectable in that setting.</li>
<li>The brands do not display anymore in the explorer of the products and categories listing and the categories do not display anymore in the explorer of the brands listing. That's more logical and will avoid confusion for the users of the backend.</li>
<li>The eSelect / Moneris plugin is now compatible with PHP 8.</li>
<li>The frontend URL of the product page is now also included in the contact request email sent to the admin.</li>
<li>The "access level" settings under the "access level" tab of the HikaShop configuration are now sorted alphabetically based on the translated text of the label and not based on their key, which makes more sense for  languages other than English.</li>
<li>The address data would be lost in the input fields of the address form when editing an address of an order in the backend and an error would happen. The user would have to cancel to be able to edit it again with the previous data entered. We improved this so that the data entered by the user could be provided to the form so that he would just have to change the field with the issue.</li>
<li>The display of messages in the backend on Joomla 4 could sometimes produce a message box with a non-functioning (and useless) close button as it was relying on a Joomla 3 capability. We now use HikaShop's message display system in these cases and it makes more sense and works better.</li>
<li>We added some adjustement in Product design clothes plugin in order to better fit with the Joomla 4 frontend templates.</li>
<li>We improved the way the address field of the auto fill plugin was displayed and used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New features (9)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We've added an option "Group options with product for the shipping price calculation" to control if product options should be grouped to their products during the shipping price calculation.</li>
<li>It is now possible to synchronize the quantity input field and the add to cart button display with the product information in the cart thanks to the new setting "Synchronized add to cart" in the HikaShop configuration.</li>
<li>We have added a new "popup mode" settings to products listing so that you can display the product details page in a popup on the listing page instead of being redirected to the full product details page.</li>
<li>HikaShop now supports the use/upload of webp images.</li>
<li>We've added a translation interface for the custom fields.</li>
<li>It is now possible to reorder the different sections of the product edit form by drag & drop. And when you save a product with a new order of the interface elements, this will be remembered for when you edit/create products in the future.</li>
<li>We've added a "return URL" setting to the "user points" payment plugin.</li>
<li>There is now a format setting for the cursor labels of cursor filters not based on the price so that you can fine tune the format of the numbers (decimals, grouping, prefix, suffix, etc).</li>
<li>The category explorer on the products / categories / brands listings can now be closed /opened with a button on it. And this will be remembered next time you access the same listing. It will be closed by default for the categories/brands listings as in most cases it is not needed there.</li>
</ul>

<li>When two menu separators are one after the other in a dropdown menu of the backend interface (usually due to ACLs), we now only display one separator.</li>

<li>We added instalments support to the ATOS SIPS v2 payment plugin.</li>
<li>The ATOS SIPS v2 payment plugin has now an extra "mode" option so that you can choose to use either the normal V2 mode, or the v2 simplified mode, or the V2 mode without transaction reference so that you can support the different modes possible based on the contract you have with your bank. If you're updating, you might need to review that setting to adapt it to your situation.</li>

<li>When the user doesn't have any shipping addresses, we normally display the new shipping address form. However, if the shipping address is being overridden by the shipping method and we don't want that as we only want to display the shipping address override.

<li>You can now translate shipping methods and payment methods name with translation overrides.</li>

<li>We now display a proper error message when cookies are not available when you try to add something to the cart. (for cookies modules/plugins)</li>
<li>Some third party system plugin could break the new checkout editor in some rare cases so we've made some modifications to circumvent these.</li>
<li>We have removed the support of UPS "Freight" services as they are supported by a separate XML API and not the API used by the UPS shipping plugin.</li>
<li>We have improved the displaying of product code through the checkout cart.</li>
<li>The error message with the alias already existing won't block the saving of the product anymore.</li>
<li>The address_id has been added in the onAfterAddressCreate trigger.</li>

<li>The filter reset button is now removed if no filter is selected.</li>
<li>We improved the shipping debug mode so that it will only be triggered during checkout workfow.</li>
<li>We avoid confirming orders several times when paybox sends the same payment notification several times.</li>
<li>We now skip the display of options without variants if they don't have stock even if the "Display out of stock products" setting is activated in the HikaShop configuration since their purchase is not possible anyways.</li>
<li>We improved the way information was sent to the USPS platform for international shippings.</li>
<li>We improved the partner statistics interface in the backend.</li>
<li>An error message is now properly displayed when you click on an "add to cart" button displayed by a module while the "put the store offline" setting is activated.</li>
<li>We've improved the CSV parsing.</li>
<li>The order status notification and order notification emails now will have the "pay now" link if the "payment of orders not paid immediately" setting is activated and the status of the order is in the list of statuses under the column "unpaid" of the System>Order statuses menu.</li>
<li>It's now possible to search on the date in the order listing for the customers.</li>
<li>We now do not display the options for the "fields" view on the checkout workflow interface if you don't have the Business edition since the custom order fields are not usable with the Business edition.</li>

<li>We swapped the display of the custom product fields and the dimensions on the tabular layout.</li>
<li>We've improved the display of the votes area on listings when no votes have yet been submitted for a product. You can now easily switch between a "no votes" label and stars with a bit of CSS.</li>
<li>We have updated available FedEx packaging types.</li>
<li>We adapted options controlling the display of custom fields which have a "custom text" type and which are from the "Item" table.</li>

<li>The default quantity input method is now "default in DIV" instead of "default" which is much nicer and display better.</li>
<li>The return_url parameter has been removed from SEF urls to avoid the database of URLs of extensions like sh404SEF from growing too big.</li>
<li>You can now enter prices for currencies which are unpublished but with the "displayed" setting activated (for when the prices can be displayed in that currency on the listings and product page, but will revert to the main currency prices on the checkout).</li>
</ul>
<h4>New features (6)</h4>
<ul>
<li>We made several improvements to the address creation / edition system on the checkout to separate billing and shipping addresses.</li>
<li>We've added a new "Show 'same address' checkbox" setting for the login view of the checkout workflow.</li>
<li>We've added several options to turn off the IP logging for the different areas where HikaShop can log them (user registration, order creation, history of order) so that you have a greater control of the data you request from the user.</li>
<li>The payment notification email now uses the email system of HikaShop and has its own editable email instead of a text version through Joomla email system. That way, it can contain all the order information instead of just the notification message.</li>
<li>There is now an "apply coupons" setting distinct from the "apply discounts" setting in order to be able to configure them independently from one another.</li>
<li>We added a "allowed extensions" setting for Ajax File and Ajax Image custom fields so that different fields can have different restrictions on the extension of the files.</li>
</ul>

	<li>There was a side effect of the handling of the pagination by the redirect post mode system on the listings. Because of that, when two modules were loaded in the main area of the template in a HikaShop view (for customization for example), it lead to the number of items of the first module being used by both.</li>

	<li>The title of the free files download area on the product page was missing for variants.</li>

	<li>The rounding of prices on the listings didn't take into account the increment configured in the currency for taxes when the "round prices during calculation" setting was activated.</li>
	<li>There could be some checking issues with custom fields using the "display limited to" setting and being required in some rare cases.</li>
