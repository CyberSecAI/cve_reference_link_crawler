The provided content is related to CVE-2024-1491.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Electrolink devices lack authentication for the endpoint that handles MPFS file system binary image uploads. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious image, overwriting the flash program memory that holds the web server's interfaces.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306). Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the absence of authentication for the endpoint that manages MPFS file system binary image uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to overwrite the flash program memory, enabling arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network by sending a request to the unprotected endpoint to upload a malicious MPFS file system binary image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without authentication or any specific privileges. They only need network access to the device.
