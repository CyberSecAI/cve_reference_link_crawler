{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks CSRF checks in certain areas and also lacks proper sanitization and escaping of user inputs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to missing sanitization and escaping, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to lack of CSRF checks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website through stored XSS, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in administrator.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted HTML file that, when opened by a logged-in admin, automatically submits a form to the vulnerable plugin, injecting the XSS payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious HTML file."
