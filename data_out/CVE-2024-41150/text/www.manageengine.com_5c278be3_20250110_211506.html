**Details**

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allowed users to inject malicious JavaScript while creating a new request. This script would be executed whenever a user opens the request details page.

**Impact**

Threat actors with access to the request module can exploit this vulnerability to carry out additional attacks.

**How was it resolved?**

We resolved the issue by encoding data during client-side rendering, preventing the execution of JavaScript.
