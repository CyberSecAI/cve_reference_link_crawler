- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the request module, allowing users to inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Threat actors with access to the request module can inject malicious JavaScript, which would then execute when other users open the request details page. This could lead to further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with access to the request module can inject malicious JavaScript while creating a new request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the request module to create new requests.
