Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The access control check for events in the backend module was broken during an update to TYPO3 12.4. Specifically, the `RedirectResponse` returned by the `$this->redirect()` function was not properly handled. This resulted in the access check not being enforced, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control (CWE-284):** The primary vulnerability is that the intended access control mechanism was not functioning correctly, leading to unauthorized access.
- The `checkEventAccess` function was changed to return a boolean value instead of void. The return value was not being used correctly which resulted in the intended redirect not occurring, but the code continuing regardless.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially access and perform actions on events without having the necessary privileges, leading to information disclosure.
- The impact is limited to a low level of confidentiality impact, as there is no impact to integrity or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network, meaning a remote attacker can perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low-level privileges, i.e. a backend user account.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in version 7.0.0 of the `derhansen/sf_event_mgt` composer package and was fixed in version 7.4.0.
- The CVSS score is 4.3, with metrics of: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
