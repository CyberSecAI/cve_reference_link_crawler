Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from a bypass of a security mitigation within Jira Server and Data Center related to template injection in email templates. Specifically, the mitigation was intended to prevent the use of the XStream library from Velocity templates, but this was circumvented.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Template Injection:** The primary vulnerability is template injection within the email templates feature. This means an attacker can inject malicious code into the template engine, allowing them to control how the template is processed.
    *   **Bypass of Mitigation:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the intended security measure that was meant to prevent code execution using the XStream library.
    *   **Use of XStream library:** The vulnerability leverages the XStream library to execute arbitrary code, which was the target of the mitigation.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker with system administrator permissions to execute arbitrary code, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected Jira instance, including data theft, data manipulation, and denial of service.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through crafted email templates. Attackers need to be able to modify email templates to inject the malicious code.

*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have system administrator permissions to modify email templates.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the affected server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS score of 7.2
*   The vulnerability affects versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center before the specified fix versions.
*   The fix involves improved handling of templates to prevent code execution via XStream.
*  This issue is a public security vulnerability.
