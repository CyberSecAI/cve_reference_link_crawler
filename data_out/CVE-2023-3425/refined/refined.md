**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An incorrect check on memory buffer size in M-Files Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) vulnerability allowing an attacker to read memory beyond allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated user can read a restricted amount of bytes from the server's memory. This vulnerability is classified as having a high impact on availability, despite not impacting confidentiality or integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based attack (AV:N). The vulnerability does not require user interaction (UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker can be unauthenticated (PR:N), but the attack requires a high level of complexity (AC:H) to exploit.
