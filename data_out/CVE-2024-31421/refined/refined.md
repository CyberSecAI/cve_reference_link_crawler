- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Popup by Supsystic plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unprivileged user (subscriber) can execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable function in the WordPress plugin, where the lack of access control allows unauthorized actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
