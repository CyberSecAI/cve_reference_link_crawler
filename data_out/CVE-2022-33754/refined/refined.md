- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the Automic agent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation leading to a potential buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker position.
