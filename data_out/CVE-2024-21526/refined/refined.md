- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `speaker` npm package, where providing unexpected input types to the `channels` property of the `Speaker` object leads to an assertion failure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) condition caused by improper handling of input data types for the `channels` property, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a process crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a non-numeric input, such as the string "A", to the `channels` property when creating a `Speaker` object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted requests with invalid input to the application using the vulnerable package. No special privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker can be remotely located as the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack.
