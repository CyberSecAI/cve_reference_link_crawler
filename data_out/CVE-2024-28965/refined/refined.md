- The vulnerable API is exposed over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a remote user with low-level privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the network where the vulnerable API is exposed.
- The attacker does not require user interaction to exploit this.

**Additional Notes:**
