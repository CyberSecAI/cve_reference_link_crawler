- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pie Register plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF protection when deleting users through an init action handler.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization and CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can delete arbitrary users, including their posts.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific parameters (`vdeleteit=1&vusers[]=user_id`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send a request to the vulnerable endpoint from any location.
