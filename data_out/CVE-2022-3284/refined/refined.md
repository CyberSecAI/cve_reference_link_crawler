Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure method of passing the download key for files within the M-Files vault. This key, which is necessary to access a specific file, was transmitted in a manner that made it susceptible to logging.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Key Transmission:** The download key, which grants access to files, was transmitted insecurely, allowing for potential interception.
- **SessionID Exposure:** The download key also contained the user's SessionID, further compromising security upon capture.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized parties to gain access to files within the vault.
- **Information Exposure:** The insecure transmission led to the potential exposure of sensitive information contained within the downloaded files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** Attackers could potentially intercept the download key by sniffing network traffic.
- **Log Analysis:** The insecure transmission of the key also made it susceptible to being logged, which an attacker could exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic or access the log files where the keys were recorded.
- **Low Privilege:** The CVSS score indicates that a low privilege attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The affected product is M-Files New Web versions prior to 22.11.12011.0.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CAPEC-158 (Sniffing Network Traffic).
- The CVSS score is 6.5, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
