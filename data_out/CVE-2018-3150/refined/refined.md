Here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-3150 based on the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `Utility` component of OpenJDK does not properly ensure that the `Multi-Release` attribute is read from outside of the main manifest attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of the `Multi-Release` attribute in signed Jar manifests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially construct a malicious, untrusted Java application or applet.
- This malicious application or applet could then bypass sandbox restrictions, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a specially designed JAR file that exploits the weakness in how the `Multi-Release` attribute is handled.
- This malicious JAR file would then be deployed on the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to create or modify JAR files, as well as deploy or trick a user into using these malicious files.
- It is a remote exploit without requiring authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- Multiple sources mention this CVE along with other Java vulnerabilities, emphasizing that it is part of a larger set of issues in Oracle JDK/JRE that were resolved at the same time.
- Some vendors have explicitly marked this as a low severity issue, and other vendors note that the exploit requires high attack complexity.
