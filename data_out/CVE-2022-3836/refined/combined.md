## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Seed Social < 2.0.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Put the following payload in any of the plugin's settings with a text field and save: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
2. The XSS will be triggered when accessing the settings page again.
