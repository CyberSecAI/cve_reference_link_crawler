- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize settings, allowing malicious script injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of other users accessing the plugin's settings page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A high-privileged user (such as an admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into any of the plugin's text-based settings fields. The XSS is triggered when the settings page is accessed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user with access to the plugin's settings. This typically means an administrator role in WordPress.
