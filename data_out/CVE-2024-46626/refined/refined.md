Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the openSIS-Classic Version 9.1 web application. The application fails to properly sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied data is directly included in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Data Access: An attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- Data Manipulation: The attacker can modify or delete existing data, potentially leading to data corruption or loss.
- Full Database Compromise: In severe cases, the attacker might gain complete control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `Ajax.php` endpoint.
- Parameter injection: The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious SQL code through the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authentication: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the openSIS-Classic application.
- No elevated privileges needed: The attacker does not require administrative or elevated system privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides example payloads demonstrating boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- It also includes references to the repository where more information can be found, along with screenshots of `sqlmap` and `burp` exploitation.
