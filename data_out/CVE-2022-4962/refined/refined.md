Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission verification in the `searchUsersByKeyword` method within `UserInfoController.java` of the Apollo configuration center's administrator tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness is the failure to implement adequate permission checks on the `searchUsersByKeyword` interface. This allows users with low privileges to access it.
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerable interface exposes sensitive information about the system and other users, including `userId`, `name`, and `email`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to User Data:** Low-privileged users can access the `searchUsersByKeyword` interface and retrieve a list of all users with their associated data (userId/name/email) even though they should not have access to this.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Although the provided data (user ID, name, email) may not seem highly sensitive to the commenter, it could still be useful for further attacks such as social engineering or targeted phishing campaigns.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Interface Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing the vulnerable interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with low privileges within the Apollo configuration center.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to call the exposed endpoint.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported in Apollo versions V2.0.0 and V2.0.1.
- A maintainer suggests it's an intended feature, however, the reporter insists it allows low rights users to view data not intended for them.
