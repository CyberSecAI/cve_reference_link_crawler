The provided content contains vulnerability information for CVE-2021-44386.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser in Reolink RLC-410W devices improperly handles non-object types for the `param` field in JSON requests, leading to an assertion failure. Specifically, the code assumes that the `param` field is always a JSON object and attempts to access it using a subscription operator. If a string or other non-object type is provided as the value of the `param` field, this assumption fails causing the program to assert.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The `cgiserver.cgi` does not validate the type of the JSON `param` field before attempting to parse it. It assumes that the `param` field will always be a JSON object.
*   **Denial of Service:** The assertion failure causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, which then triggers a device reboot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause the device to reboot by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an invalid `param` value, disrupting the camera's operation.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
*   The request body must contain a JSON array with a command that expects a `param` object. The `param` value must be a non-object value such as a string, "".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the Reolink RLC-410W device.
*   While most of the vulnerable commands require a valid session token, an unauthenticated user may use TALOS-2021-1420 to bypass the authentication and exploit this vulnerability.

Specifically for **CVE-2021-44386**:

*   The vulnerability exists in the `SetPtzPatrol` command's parameter parser.
*   A crafted HTTP request with the following body will trigger the vulnerability:
    ```
    [
        {
            "cmd": "SetPtzPatrol",
            "action": 0,
            "param":  ""
        }
    ]
    ```
    This request will cause the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the device to reboot.
