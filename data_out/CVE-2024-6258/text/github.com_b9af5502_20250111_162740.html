# Missing length checks of net\_buf in rfcomm\_handle\_data

Moderate

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-7833-fcpm-3ggm
Sep 13, 2024

## Package

zephyr
(zephyr)

## Affected versions

<=3.6

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

In `rfcomm_handle_data` in `subsys/bluetooth/host/rfcomm.c`, the `buf->len` is not verified, leading to undefined behavior in the subsequent `net_buf_pull_u8(buf)` operation.

### Details

The function `rfcomm_handle_data` is called from `rfcomm_recv`.

Although there is an initial check to ensure `buf->len` is larger than `sizeof(*hdr) + 1`:

```
	if (buf->len < (sizeof(*hdr) + 1)) {
		BT_ERR("Too small RFCOMM Frame");
		return 0;
	}

```

there are no additional checks on the remaining size of `buf`.

If `buf` is exactly `sizeof(*hdr) + 1`, it will cause a crash in executing `net_buf_pull_u8(buf)` in the following code within `rfcomm_handle_data`:

```
	if (pf == BT_RFCOMM_PF_UIH_CREDIT) {
		rfcomm_dlc_tx_give_credits(dlc, net_buf_pull_u8(buf));
	}

```

I believe there should be proper length check of `buf`.

### PoC

`buf` given to `rfcomm_recv` could be like `ff ff 0a 30`.

### Impact

Result of exploitation could lead to instability (i.e., crash) or denial of service attacks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
