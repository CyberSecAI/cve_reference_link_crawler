The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6258.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `rfcomm_handle_data` function within the `subsys/bluetooth/host/rfcomm.c` file. It occurs because the code does not properly check the remaining length of the `net_buf` after the initial size check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Length Check:** The `rfcomm_handle_data` function lacks sufficient length checks on the `net_buf` (`buf`).
- **Undefined Behavior:** The lack of proper length check before using `net_buf_pull_u8(buf)` leads to undefined behavior.
- **Potential Buffer Over-read/Underflow**: When the buffer length is exactly `sizeof(*hdr) + 1`, the subsequent `net_buf_pull_u8(buf)` will attempt to read past the end of the buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact of the vulnerability is a crash due to accessing an invalid memory address.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated exploitation can lead to denial of service attacks, rendering the affected system unusable.
- **Instability:** The overall instability of the system could be impacted by this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted Bluetooth RFCOMM frame that causes the `buf` length to be equal to `sizeof(*hdr) + 1`.
- The attacker needs to send a malicious RFCOMM frame to the affected device.
- The attack vector is considered adjacent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have a low level of privileges, i.e. be able to send Bluetooth commands to the target.
- The attack complexity is low.
- The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device.
