The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Cacti, primarily focusing on bypassing input validation to inject malicious code, specifically XSS. Here's a breakdown:

**Vulnerability 1: Stored XSS in `user_admin.php` (v1.1.38)**
*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate input validation when creating a new user using the "copy" method.
*   **Weakness:** Allows bypassing username validation, permitting the creation of users with XSS payloads in the username. Character limits can be bypassed by using a web application proxy.
*  **Impact:** Stored XSS. The payload executes when the user's profile is viewed (General, Permissions or User Settings tabs).
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Create a new user via the "copy" method in `user_admin.php`.
    2.  Inject an XSS payload (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`) as the username. A web application proxy can be used to extend the character limit of the username field.
    3.  Navigate to the user's profile page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must have the ability to create new users.

**Vulnerability 2: Bypass Input Validation in `user_group_admin.php` (v1.1.38)**
*   **Root Cause:** Similar to the previous vulnerability, using the "copy" method bypasses input validation when creating a new user group.
*   **Weakness:** Allows creating user groups with malicious content. Although the character limit of the group name could not be extended by using the web application proxy trick.
*   **Impact:** HTML injection. The injected code is rendered when the user goes to delete the account.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Create a new user group using the "copy" method in `user_group_admin.php`.
    2. Inject HTML code (e.g., `<h1>test</h1>`).
    3. The HTML is rendered when attempting to delete the user group.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must have the ability to create new user groups.

**Vulnerability 3: Reflected XSS in `auth_changepassword.php` (<= 0.8.7g)**
*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate input validation on the `ref` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** Allows injecting XSS payloads through the `ref` parameter in the URL.
*   **Impact:** Reflected XSS.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Craft a URL with an XSS payload in the `ref` parameter of `auth_changepassword.php`
        (e.g., `/auth_changepassword.php?ref=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E`).
    2.  The XSS payload will be executed in the victim's browser after they access the crafted link.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to visit the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes**

* The GitHub issue shows that these vulnerabilities were reported by `m8sec` and acknowledged by `cigamit`.
* The vulnerabilities were addressed, and a fix was committed.
* The stored XSS issues in `user_admin.php` and `user_group_admin.php` were fixed by addressing the input validation issues.
* The reflected XSS vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the `ref` parameter input.

The provided information gives more detail than a standard CVE description. The github issue explicitly outlines the vulnerable code and the steps to exploit it.
