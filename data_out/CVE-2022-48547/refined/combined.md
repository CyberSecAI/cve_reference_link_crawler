| v1.1.38 Stored XSS in user\_admin.php When creating a new user on /cacti/user\_admin.php, using the “copy” method, it is possible to bypass user input validation. This allows for the creation of a user called `<script>alert(1)</script>`.  *This username just meets the max characters allowed. However, this restriction can be circumvented to allow for longer usernames/XSS payloads by using a web application proxy and editing the request before it is sent to the server.*  [screen shot 2018-08-29 at 3 50 39 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13889819/44853090-fdba7e00-ac32-11e8-9f08-a48f5c33eceb.png)  The stored XSS payload can be executed by clicking in the user’s profile and visiting the “General”, “Permissions”, or “User Settings” tabs.  ``` http://127.0.0.1/cacti/user_admin.php?action=user_edit&id=[#}&tab=general http://127.0.0.1/cacti/user_admin.php?action=user_edit&id=[#]&tab=realms http://127.0.0.1/cacti/user_admin.php?action=user_edit&id=[#]&tab=settings  ```  [unsanitized username1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13889819/44853145-25114b00-ac33-11e8-82ac-478190eeb12c.png) v1.1.38 Bypass Input Validation in user\_group\_admin.php The same vulnerability, of using the “copy” approach to bypass input validation, exists on the user\_group\_admin.php page. However, I was unable to use the web application proxy trick to extend the field name.  [screen shot 2018-08-30 at 8 18 33 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13889819/44853439-fe074900-ac33-11e8-8fe8-3463b96d69c1.png)  When trying to go back and delete this, I ran into some issues that required me to manually go into the database and remove the group from the “user\_auth\_group” table.  [screen shot 2018-08-30 at 8 19 06 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13889819/44853457-08c1de00-ac34-11e8-8c03-af9312927b6c.png)  *EDIT* - As a PoC I was able to use this for htlm injection, by creating the group `<h1>test</h1>`. However, the code only rendered when going back to delete the account: [screen shot 2018-08-30 at 10 36 58 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13889819/44858964-234e8400-ac41-11e8-974d-5572af97153a.png) *Side-Note:* <=0.8.7g Reflected XSS in auth\_changepassword.php I started looking into Cacti after I ran into version 0.8.7g for a customer. There were several reflected xss vulnerabilities after authentication, but I came across this one in auth\_changepassword.php that I did not see very well documented *(I could be wrong about that)*.  ``` /auth_changepassword.php?ref=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E  ```  [screen shot 2018-08-30 at 9 16 52 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13889819/44854024-77536b80-ac35-11e8-949a-14a6521e2c51.png) Looking at the code itself I saw a hidden parameter that does not validate user input. This code was modified in the later versions 0.8.7.h+.  -m8r0wn |
