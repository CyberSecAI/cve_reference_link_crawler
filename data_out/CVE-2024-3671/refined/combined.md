### Description

The Print-O-Matic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'print-me' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'tag'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

We had made a mess of the printing stylesheet in Print-O-Matic for a payback calculator on a client site and could not get the look we wanted. Baden responded to our support ticket within minutes and spent what must have been several hours diagnosing and then fixing our CSS, even though the issues were completely of our making, not caused by any issue with Print-O-Matic. And it was timely as the client was heading to a trade show the next day where they would be filling in the form with prospects and handing them a printout.

The plugin works like described. It is simple to use, and also comes with comprehensive documentation which covers most all cases.The support is quick and very assistive. They have helped us resolve every issue we’ve had. Often they reply as fast as if we were in a private chat instead of a public forum. Excellent staff, and stuff! Thanks.

Literally just works. Client requested that only a specific part of the page be printed. By making a certain section an “article” HTML Tag and making it so that the Print button makes it so it only prints the “article” HTTML Tag section it makes it so the print preview only shows the section I want, and like the client requested, have it only print 1 single page.
