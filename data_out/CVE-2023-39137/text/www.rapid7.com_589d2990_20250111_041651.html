# WinRAR Filename Spoofing

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### WinRAR Filename Spoofing

Disclosed
09/28/2009

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module abuses a filename spoofing vulnerability in WinRAR. The vulnerability exists
when opening ZIP files. The file names showed in WinRAR when opening a ZIP file come from
the central directory, but the file names used to extract and open contents come from the
Local File Header. This inconsistency allows to spoof file names when opening ZIP files
with WinRAR, which can be abused to execute arbitrary code, as exploited in the wild in
March 2014

#### Author(s)

* chr1x
* juan vazquez <juan.vazquez@metasploit.com>

#### Platform

Windows

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/winrar_name_spoofing.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/winrar_name_spoofing.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/fileformat/winrar_name_spoofing
msf exploit(winrar_name_spoofing) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(winrar_name_spoofing) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(winrar_name_spoofing) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(winrar_name_spoofing) > exploit
```

### Metasploit

Penetration testing software for offensive security teams.

Key Features

* [Collect and share all the information you need to conduct a successful and efficient penetration test](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Simulate complex attacks against your systems and users](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Test your defenses to make sure they’re ready](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Automate Every Step of Your Penetration Test](/products/metasploit/features)

[Free Metasploit Pro Trial](/try/metasploit-pro/)
[View All Features](/products/metasploit/features/)

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

– Jim O’Gorman | President, Offensive Security
