- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Easy WP Cleaner plugin (versions <= 1.9) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could enable a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact would vary depending on the actions that can be triggered.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into submitting it, thus executing unwanted actions on the user's behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious page. No specific user privilege is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
