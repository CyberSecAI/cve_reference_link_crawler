The provided content is a GitHub page displaying a PDF file named "Simple-Membership-System club_edit_query.php has Sqlinjection.pdf". The filename suggests the PDF likely contains information about a SQL injection vulnerability in the `club_edit_query.php` file of a "Simple-Membership-System".

However, this is just a file listing, and does not provide specific details about the vulnerability itself. Therefore, I cannot extract information about the root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors, or attacker capabilities.
