Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in The Events Calendar and Events Calendar Pro plugins. Specifically, the plugins fail to prevent users with the "contributor" role (or higher) from accessing event details that they should not have permission to view. This includes password-protected events, drafts, and other restricted event statuses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to enforce access restrictions based on user roles and event statuses. Contributors can use shortcodes to bypass these restrictions.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of sensitive event data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Users with contributor roles can view event details that should be restricted, such as the content of private or password-protected events.
- **Information Leakage:** Confidential information present within those events becomes accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Potential Security Risk:** The access to sensitive event details could lead to other malicious activities if the content contains sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers (users with contributor or higher roles) can embed specific shortcodes into posts or pages to retrieve details of events they do not have direct access to.
- **Event ID Manipulation:** By guessing or knowing the event ID, a contributor can use this ID in the shortcode to view the details of the targeted event.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **WordPress Contributor Role:** The attacker needs to have at least the contributor role within the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Event IDs:** The attacker needs to either know or guess the ID of the event they want to access.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects both the free "The Events Calendar" plugin and the premium "Events Calendar Pro" plugin.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 6.4.0.1 and later for both plugins.
- The provided content also offers a proof of concept for both the free and pro plugin scenarios.
- The CVSS score is 2.7 (Low), based on a high required privilege (Contributor role) and low confidentiality impact.
