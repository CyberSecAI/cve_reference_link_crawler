Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control in BoltWire CMS v6.03. Specifically, the application fails to properly restrict access to user passwords via the `index.php?p=member.admin&action=data` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The application does not sufficiently validate or restrict access to sensitive data. The parameter `index.php?p=member.admin&action=data` allows unauthorized viewing of user passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view the passwords of all users, including the administrator.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive user information.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can change data within the application.
- **Application Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the application for malicious purposes.
- **Complete Takeover**: By obtaining administrator credentials, an attacker may gain full control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific URL with the vulnerable parameter `index.php?p=member.admin&action=data`.  By manipulating the `admin` parameter to other user names, an attacker can retrieve the passwords for other users as well.
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is remote, requiring only network access to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable BoltWire CMS application.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP requests:** Knowledge of how to modify parameters in a URL.
- No user authentication is needed.
