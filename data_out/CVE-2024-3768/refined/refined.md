Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3768 (based on the provided content indicating "search.php SQL injection" and the title and description of the vuldb entry)

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `searchtitle` parameter in the `search.php` file of the "News Portal Project in PHP Free Download" application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of unsanitized user input (`searchtitle`) within SQL queries. This lack of input validation is the core weakness.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code likely does not use prepared statements with parameterized queries, which would prevent the user-supplied data from being interpreted as SQL code.
- **No Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-supplied input to ensure it's safe to use within SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain control of the system through database manipulation, possibly leading to RCE (Remote Code Execution).
- **Service Disruption:** The attack can lead to denial of service by disrupting normal database operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the `searchtitle` parameter in the `search.php` file, which can be manipulated through a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The provided information explicitly states, "No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability".
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's vulnerable endpoint (`search.php`).
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker requires some knowledge of SQL to craft malicious injection payloads.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests with the malicious payload in the `searchtitle` parameter.

**Additional Details from Provided Content:**
- **Vulnerable File:** `search.php`
- **Affected Product:** "News Portal Project in PHP Free Download"
- **Affected Version:** V1.0
- **Vulnerability Types (Specific):** The exploit can be performed as boolean-based blind, time-based blind, or using UNION query techniques.
- **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided payloads demonstrate different SQL injection techniques:
    - Boolean-based blind: `searchtitle=-9316' OR 6023=6023-- AadK`
    - Time-based blind: `searchtitle=111111111111' AND (SELECT 9951 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))iYDj)-- Gwvj`
    - UNION query: `searchtitle=111111111111' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,CONCAT(0x717a6b6a71,0x79545450594a584c6f45664661544878734c6645765a587778545a56434e614647726d557a444c4a,0x71627a7671),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -`
- **Exploitation using sqlmap:** The provided `sqlmap` command demonstrates how automated tools can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Suggested Repair:** The document suggests using prepared statements, input validation, minimum database user permissions, and regular security audits.
