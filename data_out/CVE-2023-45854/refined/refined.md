Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the "add-to-cart" functionality of Shopkit 1.0. The system fails to properly handle large integer values for the item quantity (`qtd` parameter), causing an overflow and resulting in negative quantities being stored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer overflow: The application does not correctly validate or handle the size of the quantity parameter when adding items to the shopping cart.
- Business Logic Flaw:  The application allows negative quantities to be added to the cart, resulting in an incorrect total calculation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   Attackers can manipulate the cart contents by adding items with a negative quantity which effectively removes items from the cart without actually removing them. This would lead to financial loss for the merchant.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Sending a POST request to the `/cart/add` endpoint with a manipulated `qtd` parameter set to a large integer that will cause an integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/cart/add` endpoint. No authentication is required according to the text.
