The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, and the commit message indicates "安全漏洞修复 感谢 姜洋-长亭科技" which translates to "Security vulnerability fix, thanks to Jiang Yang - Changting Technology". This strongly suggests the commit is a fix for a security vulnerability, which would be related to the CVE.

The changes include:
- Updates to `build.gradle` and `pom.xml`, changing the version from `V4.0.202204.a` to `V4.0.202204.b`.
- Change to `CmsVersion.java` changing the revision from "a" to "b".
- Adding `needAppToken()` methods to `SysConfigDataDirective.java` and `SysDatasourceDirective.java` that return `true`.

Based on the changes, the vulnerability fixed is likely related to missing authentication/authorization checks when accessing `SysConfigDataDirective` and `SysDatasourceDirective`. By adding `needAppToken()` and requiring the app token, these directives are no longer accessible without proper authorization.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization check when accessing the `SysConfigDataDirective` and `SysDatasourceDirective`. These directives likely exposed sensitive configuration and/or datasource information without requiring authentication or a valid token.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure direct object reference: The directives could be directly accessed without any authentication.
- Information disclosure:  Sensitive configuration and/or datasource information was exposed to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data like configuration settings and datasource information. This can be used for further attacks like data breaches or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote access via HTTP/HTTPS requests directly to the vulnerable endpoints exposing the directives.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the application.
- No authentication required before the fix.
