Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0383

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `group_tag` attribute within the `[wprm-recipe-instructions]` and `[wprm-recipe-ingredients]` shortcodes of the WP Recipe Maker plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The plugin does not properly sanitize the `group_tag` attribute allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or Javascript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious web scripts into pages, which will execute when a user views the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Stealing sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `group_tag` attribute of the `[wprm-recipe-instructions]` and `[wprm-recipe-ingredients]` shortcodes.
- An authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher can insert malicious code through the `group_tag` attribute in recipe instructions or ingredients.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level permissions to create or edit posts/pages where they can use the shortcodes.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in WP Recipe Maker plugin versions up to and including 9.1.0.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 9.1.1.
- The fix involved replacing `sanitize_key` with `WPRM_Shortcode_Helper::sanitize_html_element` to properly sanitize the input in the affected files:
  - `wp-recipe-maker/trunk/includes/public/shortcodes/recipe/class-wprm-sc-instructions.php`
  - `wp-recipe-maker/trunk/includes/public/shortcodes/recipe/class-wprm-sc-ingredients.php`
- The vulnerability was discovered by wesley (wcraft).
