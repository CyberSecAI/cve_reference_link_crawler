- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RestAPI did not properly check if a user who was supposed to authenticate with multiple factors had fully authenticated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: 2FA bypass vulnerability in the RestAPI.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to full compromise (high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact).
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation through the RestAPI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special capabilities or positions are needed according to CVSS. Network access is enough (AV:N). The complexity of the attack is high (AC:H) but this is likely due to it being a multi-factor bypass.
