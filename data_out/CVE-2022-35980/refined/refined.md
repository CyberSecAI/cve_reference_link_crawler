Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35980:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how OpenSearch resolves index patterns when Document Level Security (DLS), Field Level Security (FLS), or field masking are in use. Specifically, when a query's search pattern matches an aliased index, the security filters (DLS/FLS/masking) are not applied correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is the improper authorization of access to data due to the failure to apply security filters on aliased indexes.
- **Index Resolution Logic:** The logic for resolving index patterns into concrete indices was confusing and made it hard to verify its behavior.
- **Bypass of Security Features**:  The vulnerability allows bypassing of DLS, FLS, and field masking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Exploitation allows unauthorized access to sensitive information that should have been protected by DLS, FLS, or field masking configurations.  
- **Data Breach Potential:** If sensitive data is stored in an aliased index, this flaw could allow it to be accessed by unauthorized users or processes.
- **Circumvention of Access Control:**  The vulnerability effectively renders the access control measures ineffective.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Queries**: An attacker could construct queries that target aliased indexes using a broad pattern like '*' which would normally be restricted, thereby accessing sensitive documents or fields they aren't authorized for.
- **Exploiting Default Configurations:** Since OpenSearch Dashboards creates an alias to `.kibana` by default, the vulnerability can be exploited in default installations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to OpenSearch Cluster:** The attacker needs to be able to send queries to an OpenSearch cluster where the security plugin with DLS/FLS/masking is enabled.
- **Knowledge of Aliased Indexes:** While not a strict requirement, the attacker needs to be aware of the existence and usage of aliased indexes to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in OpenSearch versions 2.0.0 and 2.1.0.
- It was fixed in OpenSearch version 2.2.0 and later.
- The fix involved updating the index resolution logic to ensure that concrete indices are included during resolution for DLS/FLS/Masking checks. This includes clearer logic and adding tests.
- The pull request #1999 ([https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/pull/1999](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/pull/1999)) addresses this issue.
- There were additional fixes to handle data streams as well in backports.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-612 (Improper Authorization).
- The fix included changes to `src/main/java/org/opensearch/security/securityconf/ConfigModelV7.java`, and added tests in `src/test/java/org/opensearch/security/dlic/dlsfls/FlsIndexingTests.java` and `src/test/java/org/opensearch/security/securityconf/impl/v7/IndexPatternTests.java`
