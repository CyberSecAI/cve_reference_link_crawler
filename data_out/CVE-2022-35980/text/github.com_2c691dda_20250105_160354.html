# Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information in OpenSearch

High

[peternied](/peternied)
published
GHSA-f4qr-f4xx-hjxw
Aug 12, 2022

## Package

docker

OpenSearch
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

2.0.0, 2.1.0

## Patched versions

>=2.2.0

## Description

### Impact

Requests to an OpenSearch cluster configured with advanced access control features ([document level security (DLS)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/access-control/document-level-security/), [field level security (FLS)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/access-control/field-level-security/), and/or [field masking](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/access-control/field-masking/)) will not be filtered when the query's search pattern matches an aliased index.

OpenSearch Dashboards creates an alias to `.kibana` by default, so filters with the index pattern of `*` to restrict access to documents or fields will not be applied.

This issue allows requests to access sensitive information when customer have acted to restrict access that specific information.

### Patches

OpenSearch 2.2.0+ contains the fix for this issue.

### Workarounds

There is no recommended work around.

### References

See pull request [#1999](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/pull/1999) for additional details.
