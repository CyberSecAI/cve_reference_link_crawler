```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing EMF files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability in combination with others to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable code path when parsing EMF files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious EMF file or a malicious webpage containing a specially crafted EMF file. The attacker must also rely on the user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable application."
