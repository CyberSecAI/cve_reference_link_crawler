# CVE-2022-37857, CVE-2022-37163, CVE-2022-37164 Hardcoded Credentials/Weak Password Policies

[gainsec](https://gainsec.com/author/gainsec/ "Posts by gainsec")
[Android Hacking](https://gainsec.com/category/android-hacking/), [CVE](https://gainsec.com/category/cve/), [Hacking Android](https://gainsec.com/category/hacking-android/), [Mobile Penetration Testing](https://gainsec.com/category/penetration-testing/mobile-penetration-testing/), [Pentesting Android](https://gainsec.com/category/pentesting-android/)
August 7, 2022August 26, 2022

* [CVE-2022-37857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37857)
* Affected product and version: Hauk version 1.6.1
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and hardcoded credentials
* Description: Hauk v1.6.1 requires a hardcoded password which by default is blank. This hardcoded password is hashed but stored within the config.php file server-side as well as in clear-text on the android client device by default.

* [CVE-2022-37163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37163)
* Affected Product and version: IHateToBudget version 1.5.7
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
* Description: IHateToBudget v1.5.7 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.

* [CVE-2022-37164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37164)
* Affected product and version: OnTrack version 3.4
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
* Description: OnTrack v3.4 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.

So I ran into an interesting issue with a self-hosted location sharing service that includes a android client available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.varden.hauk/) and the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.varden.hauk&hl=en&gl=US).

I reached out to the developer talking about the Janus vulnerability although I think that his response was totally legitimate. Which you can read about [HERE](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/issues/187).

If you’re interested in the Janus vulnerability, check more information about it [HERE](https://medium.com/mobis3c/exploiting-apps-vulnerable-to-janus-cve-2017-13156-8d52c983b4e0)!

Regardless what I decided to pursue and report was the fact that credentials are hardcoded [HERE](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/blob/master/backend-php/include/config-sample.php#L73), although of course you need to replace config-sample.php to config.php.

So the developer was professional and didn’t have real push back but their choice was to leave the password requirements/hardcoded credential requirement to the administrator.

Even though I completely understand it, I wanted to let those that rely on this server/client know.

That is where [CVE-2022-37857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37857) comes from!

Following that path, the OnTrack application found [HERE](https://github.com/inoda/ontrack) was also vulnerable and assigned [CVE-2022-37164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37164)

Lastly the same issue was found in the [IHateToBudget](https://github.com/bminusl/ihatetobudget) application found HERE and was assigned [CVE-2022-37163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37163)

Hope its helpful!

| Hello 👋  I run a security community that finds and fixes vulnerabilities in OSS. A researcher ([@J-GainSec](https://github.com/J-GainSec)) has found a potential issue, which I would be eager to share with you.  Could you add a `SECURITY.md` file with an e-mail address for me to send further details to? GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) a security policy to ensure issues are responsibly disclosed, and it would help direct researchers in the future.  Looking forward to hearing from you 👍  (cc [@huntr-helper](https://github.com/huntr-helper)) |

| [@inoda](https://github.com/inoda) - I have made both reports public at the same URLs.  We do not make reports private for adoption, but purely because many maintainers don't want reports public by default. We allow maintainers to access reports using magic URLs, where sign-up is not required at all. This is why we first request an e-mail, so we can send a magic URL to view the reports 👍 |
