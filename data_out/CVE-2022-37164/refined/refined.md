Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-37164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The OnTrack application (version 3.4) employs a weak password policy.
*   User passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Password Policy:**  The application does not enforce strong password requirements, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
*   **Insufficient Password Hashing:** Passwords are hashed without using a salt or pepper, making them vulnerable to cracking using tools like hashcat.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   Successful password cracking could expose user accounts and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Brute-force attacks:** Due to the weak password policy, an attacker could try various combinations to guess user passwords.
*   **Hash cracking:**  An attacker who has access to the password hashes could use tools like hashcat to crack them due to the lack of salting/peppering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to have knowledge of the application's weak password policy and how it hashes passwords.
*   The attacker must be able to either attempt brute-force attacks or acquire the password hashes.
