| | CWE Glossary Definition | x | | --- | --- | |  | |      CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort  | Weakness ID: 916 [Vulnerability Mapping](#Vulnerability_Mapping_Notes_916): ALLOWED This CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities    Abstraction: Base Base - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. | | --- |    View customized information:  Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers.  Operational For users who are concerned with the practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts.  Mapping Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.  Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry.  Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.    × Edit Custom Filter Conceptual Operational Mapping Friendly Select All     Reset Clear Submit Cancel       + Description  The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.    + Extended Description   Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.  Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.  There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:   * The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash ("stretching") * The amount of memory required to compute the hash ("memory-hard" operations) * Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation ("salting") * Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs ("one-way" hashing) * Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs ("collision resistance")   Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.     + Common Consequences Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited to achieve a different impact.  | Scope | Impact | Likelihood | | --- | --- | --- | | Access Control | Technical Impact: *Bypass Protection Mechanism; Gain Privileges or Assume Identity*  If an attacker can gain access to the hashes, then the lack of sufficient computational effort will make it easier to conduct brute force attacks using techniques such as rainbow tables, or specialized hardware such as GPUs, which can be much faster than general-purpose CPUs for computing hashes. |  |      + Potential Mitigations  | Phase: Architecture and Design  Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations ("stretching") or the amount of memory required. Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.  Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [[REF-291](#REF-291_916)], scrypt [[REF-292](#REF-292_916)], and PBKDF2 [[REF-293](#REF-293_916)]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.  Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.   Effectiveness: High | | --- | | Phases: Implementation; Architecture and Design When using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps ([CWE-325](/data/definitions/325.html)).

These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance. Languages  Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)      + Demonstrative Examples  Example 1  In this example, a new user provides a new username and password to create an account. The program hashes the new user's password then stores it in a database.  (bad code) Example Language: Python    def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5')      While it is good to avoid storing a cleartext password, the program does not provide a salt to the hashing function, thus increasing the chances of an attacker being able to reverse the hash and discover the original password if the database is compromised.  Fixing this is as simple as providing a salt to the hashing function on initialization:  (good code) Example Language: Python    def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5',b'SaltGoesHere')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()  *# UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise* return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)      Note that regardless of the usage of a salt, the md5 hash is no longer considered secure, so this example still exhibits [CWE-327](/data/definitions/327.html).      + Observed Examples  | Reference | Description | | --- | --- | | [CVE-2008-1526](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1526) | Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords. | | [CVE-2006-1058](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1058) | Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords. | | [CVE-2008-4905](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4905) | Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash. | | [CVE-2002-1657](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1657) | Database server uses the username for a salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks. | | [CVE-2001-0967](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0967) | Server uses a constant salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks. | | [CVE-2005-0408](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0408) | chain: product generates predictable MD5 hashes using a constant value combined with username, allowing authentication bypass. |       + Weakness Ordinalities  | Ordinality | Description | | --- | --- | | Primary | (where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses) |       + Detection Methods  | Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode  According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:  Cost effective for partial coverage:  * Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis * Binary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis    Effectiveness: SOAR Partial | | --- | | Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode  According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:  Cost effective for partial coverage:  * Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies    Effectiveness: SOAR Partial | | Manual Static Analysis - Source Code  According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:  Highly cost effective:  * Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source * Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)    Effectiveness: High | | Automated Static Analysis - Source Code  According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:  Highly cost effective:  * Source code Weakness Analyzer * Context-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer    Effectiveness: High | | Automated Static Analysis  According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:  Cost effective for partial coverage:  * Configuration Checker    Effectiveness: SOAR Partial | | Architecture or Design Review  According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:  Highly cost effective:  * Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction  Cost effective for partial coverage:  * Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)    Effectiveness: High |       + Memberships  Section HelpThis MemberOf Relationships table shows additional CWE Categories and Views that reference this weakness as a member.
