| | CWE Glossary Definition | x | | --- | --- | |  | |      CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements  | Weakness ID: 521 [Vulnerability Mapping](#Vulnerability_Mapping_Notes_521): ALLOWED This CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities    Abstraction: Base Base - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. | | --- |    View customized information:  Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers.  Operational For users who are concerned with the practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts.  Mapping Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.  Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry.  Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.    × Edit Custom Filter Conceptual Operational Mapping Friendly Select All     Reset Clear Submit Cancel       + Description  The product does not require that users should have strong passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.    + Extended Description  Authentication mechanisms often rely on a memorized secret (also known as a password) to provide an assertion of identity for a user of a system. It is therefore important that this password be of sufficient complexity and impractical for an adversary to guess. The specific requirements around how complex a password needs to be depends on the type of system being protected. Selecting the correct password requirements and enforcing them through implementation are critical to the overall success of the authentication mechanism.     + Common Consequences Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited to achieve a different impact.  | Scope | Impact | Likelihood | | --- | --- | --- | | Access Control | Technical Impact: *Gain Privileges or Assume Identity*  An attacker could easily guess user passwords and gain access user accounts. |  |      + Potential Mitigations  | Phase: Architecture and Design  A product's design should require adherance to an appropriate password policy. Specific password requirements depend strongly on contextual factors, but it is recommended to contain the following attributes:   * Enforcement of a minimum and maximum length * Restrictions against password reuse * Restrictions against using common passwords * Restrictions against using contextual string in the password (e.g., user id, app name)   Depending on the threat model, the password policy may include several additional attributes.   * Complex passwords requiring mixed character sets (alpha, numeric, special, mixed case)   + Increasing the range of characters makes the password harder to crack and may be appropriate for systems relying on single factor authentication.   + Unfortunately, a complex password may be difficult to memorize, encouraging a user to select a short password or to incorrectly manage the password (write it down).   + Another disadvantage of this approach is that it often does not result in a significant increases in overal password complexity due to people's predictable usage of various symbols. * Large Minimum Length (encouraging passphrases instead of passwords)   + Increasing the number of characters makes the password harder to crack and may be appropriate for systems relying on single factor authentication.   + A disadvantage of this approach is that selecting a good passphrase is not easy and poor passwords can still be generated. Some prompting may be needed to encourage long un-predictable passwords. * Randomly Chosen Secrets   + Generating a password for the user can help make sure that length and complexity requirements are met, and can result in secure passwords being used.   + A disadvantage of this approach is that the resulting password or passpharse may be too difficult to memorize, encouraging them to be written down. * Password Expiration   + Requiring a periodic password change can reduce the time window that an adversary has to crack a password, while also limiting the damage caused by password exposures at other locations.   + Password expiration may be a good mitigating technique when long complex passwords are not desired.   See NIST 800-63B [[REF-1053](#REF-1053_521)] for further information on password requirements. | | --- | | Phase: Architecture and Design Consider a second authentication factor beyond the password, which prevents the password from being a single point of failure. See [CWE-308](/data/definitions/308.html) for further information. | | Phase: Implementation Consider implementing a password complexity meter to inform users when a chosen password meets the required attributes. |       +  Relationships  Section Help This table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness.
