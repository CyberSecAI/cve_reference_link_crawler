* [CVE-2022-37857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37857)
* Affected product and version: Hauk version 1.6.1
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and hardcoded credentials
* Description: Hauk v1.6.1 requires a hardcoded password which by default is blank. This hardcoded password is hashed but stored within the config.php file server-side as well as in clear-text on the android client device by default.

* [CVE-2022-37163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37163)
* Affected Product and version: IHateToBudget version 1.5.7
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
* Description: IHateToBudget v1.5.7 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.

* [CVE-2022-37164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37164)
* Affected product and version: OnTrack version 3.4
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
* Description: OnTrack v3.4 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.

So I ran into an interesting issue with a self-hosted location sharing service that includes a android client available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.varden.hauk/) and the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.varden.hauk&hl=en&gl=US).

I reached out to the developer talking about the Janus vulnerability although I think that his response was totally legitimate. Which you can read about [HERE](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/issues/187).

If you’re interested in the Janus vulnerability, check more information about it [HERE](https://medium.com/mobis3c/exploiting-apps-vulnerable-to-janus-cve-2017-13156-8d52c983b4e0)!

Regardless what I decided to pursue and report was the fact that credentials are hardcoded [HERE](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/blob/master/backend-php/include/config-sample.php#L73), although of course you need to replace config-sample.php to config.php.

So the developer was professional and didn’t have real push back but their choice was to leave the password requirements/hardcoded credential requirement to the administrator.

Even though I completely understand it, I wanted to let those that rely on this server/client know.

That is where [CVE-2022-37857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37857) comes from!

Following that path, the OnTrack application found [HERE](https://github.com/inoda/ontrack) was also vulnerable and assigned [CVE-2022-37164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37164)

Lastly the same issue was found in the [IHateToBudget](https://github.com/bminusl/ihatetobudget) application found HERE and was assigned [CVE-2022-37163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37163)

Hope its helpful!
