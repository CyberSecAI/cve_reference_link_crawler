### Testimonials

#### What People Said

Our (iRedMail) mail servers have been running flawlessly for years, I've never been disappointed and will continue to use iRedMail for even more years. Various mail systems promise a lot but are restricted on many points, where iRedMail just works however you need it to work.

**Dylan Ysmal <@blackfields.net>**, Sep 22, 2017

Having search for a solution to replace an Exchange + AD system with an OpenSource solution for a while. Did look at Kerio, Zentyal, Kolab, Kopano, Zimbra and Sogo from their respective free/open version, and also made a deep investigation into the available documentations and forum contents.

So far the iRedmail packaging is the far best I've seen, and answers to almost every questions I come across can be found in the existing iRedMail documentation or on the forum site.

Since all modules are "standard" open source projects, it's easy to find more information for specific issues, like OpenLdap or Postfix elsewhere.

Once I tried the installation and got it up and running in an hour or so, I didn't bother to check the other test systems again. We have now started a project to migrate our Exchange server, and to use OpenLDAP instead of Active directory for our application servers (Gitlab, Confluence, Jira, etc).

Thanks for a really good product.

As a long time user of iRedMail, we are constantly amazed by the stability and flexibility of the product. iRedMail consistently outperforms our clients expectations and the professional support we have received is second-to-none. We have absolutely no hesitation to recommend iRedMail to others!

**Mark Pike**, March 3, 2016

We are really happy with the system, excellent work, throughout the years we have used many mail systems but this is the best.

**Juan Pablo Uggino**, Dec 3, 2015

So this is my story: the more time passed, the more it felt wrong for me having a lot of my personnal data stored inside servers of giant US companies like microsoft, google... So I started to build my own personnal cloud server by renting a 7$/month small dedicated server.

iRedMail made that dream possible for the mail side. It's easy to install, easy to use, support latest mail technologies and the support provided even for free by Zhang in the forum is better than professional support of other paid companies like IBM.

So to everyone else looking for a private mail server, iredmail is the way to go.

Great solution and a great time saver for a system administrator. iRedMail will be my first choice from now on ...
You can pay and buy a software but you cant buy such support. Thanks again.

**Bahadir Tecer**, Turkiye, Call Center, [Dec 19, 2011](https://forum.iredmail.org/topic2772-turkiye-call-center-around-2000-users.html)

iRedMail is the our choice, thank's to the use of standard packages and solutions for e-mail management. Before we used sendmail and we was searching for a system that implemented maildir + Dovecot upon LDAP for the management of user accounts, so iRedMail is perfect for us. Moreover it is free, has a very good support - and I emphasize \*very good\* - and the Admin Panel - iRedAdmin-Pro, we bought as soon as deployed iRedMail, is a very valid tool to manage the system.

**Andrea Di Dato**, [Oct 21, 2010](https://forum.iredmail.org/topic1342-italy-naples-inaf-oac-research-institute-133.html)

iRedMail is the easiest and reliable mail server with all of the features that a mail server needed for the administrators.I appreciate the developers of iRedMail who have really supported tremendously to deploy the mail server by solving all of the problem of us quickly. 3 cheers to iRedMail.
