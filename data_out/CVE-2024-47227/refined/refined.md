Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities addressed in iRedAdmin, specifically related to the commits mentioned:

**1. Commit `3c72b438d412ea3ee0270f6956e19b1098c19191` - "Verify submit data and escape them."**

*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of input validation and sanitization in the iRedAdmin panel's log display functionality.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Potential for injection attacks due to unsanitized user input in log filtering parameters like domain, admin, and event.
    *   Specifically, the log.html template was passing unsanitized parameters to hidden form fields, which could be manipulated with malicious input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Although the commit message doesn't specify the exact injection type, it implies a potential for arbitrary code injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   An attacker could potentially inject malicious code through these form parameters that is then executed in the context of the victim's browser session when viewing the log page. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Manipulating the `domain`, `admin`, or `event` parameters in the HTTP request when accessing the admin log page (`/activities/admins`).
    *   Crafting a malicious URL with carefully constructed values for these parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to be an authenticated user of the iRedAdmin panel.
    *   They need to have the ability to access the admin log page.

**2. Commit `b537e71ecf522d7f10180f5f0aab4a98a881893a` - "Fix 2 possible XSS vulnerabilities."**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient output encoding when displaying user data in the iRedAdmin user list pages, specifically in ldap/user/list.html and sql/user/list.html.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Unsanitized user provided data is inserted into the HTML templates. The parameters "order_name" and "order_by" are used to sort lists of users and were not being properly escaped before being embedded within the page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via the `order_name` or `order_by` parameters in the URL when accessing the user list page. This injected script would then be executed in the browser of any user accessing the modified URL, leading to XSS attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting a URL with malicious Javascript in the `order_name` or `order_by` parameters when accessing the admin user list page (`/users/<domain>/list` or `/users/<domain>/disabled`)
    *   Social engineering attacks where users are tricked into clicking a malicious link.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to be an authenticated user of the iRedAdmin panel.
    *  They need the ability to access the user list page.

**Summary of fixes:**
*   Commit `3c72b43` addressed a potential injection issue by verifying and sanitizing input data in the admin log functionality. Input validation was added to `controllers/panel/log.py` and HTML escaping was added to `templates/default/panel/log.html`.
*   Commit `b537e71` corrected two XSS vulnerabilities by adding proper HTML escaping for user-provided parameters within the pagination links on the user list pages. The fix was applied in `controllers/ldap/user.py`, `controllers/sql/user.py`, `libs/sqllib/user.py`, `templates/default/ldap/user/list.html` and `templates/default/sql/user/list.html`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The commits were made in response to reports from external security researchers.
*   The vulnerability related to `3c72b43` did not affect iRedAdmin-Pro.
