Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2588:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the DML (Data Manipulation Language) component of the MySQL server. The specific nature of the flaw isn't detailed in the provided documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   A vulnerability exists in the way MySQL Server handles DML operations. The exact details of this vulnerability is not clear, but the vulnerability allows an attacker with high privileges to cause a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This means the MySQL server may become unresponsive or crash, preventing legitimate users from accessing the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by interacting with the MySQL server over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires high privileges within the MySQL server environment. This indicates that the attacker must have some level of prior access or control over the server to execute malicious DML statements.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-2588 is a DoS vulnerability in the DML component of MySQL Server that is exploitable over the network by attackers with high privileges within the MySQL server environment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided documents (NetApp advisory and Oracle CPU) list this CVE alongside other MySQL vulnerabilities, suggesting it was part of a larger set of issues addressed in January 2020.
*   The provided gentoo advisory also lists this CVE in a list of fixed vulnerabilities in mysql.
*   The Ubuntu security notice also lists this CVE as part of a set of issues addressed in mysql.
*   The Oracle advisory lists this as a "MySQL Server" vulnerability, and specifies that an attacker needs `Network` level access, and high privileges.
