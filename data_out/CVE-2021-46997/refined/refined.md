{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The PMR (Priority Mask Register) was not being set consistently during exception entry on ARM64 architecture. While the DAIF (interrupt mask bits) were set by hardware on exception entry, PMR was not being set early in the sequence. This discrepancy caused a lockdep warning, when DEBUG_LOCKDEP is enabled, as the lockdep_hardirqs_off() function checks if interrupts are disabled, but PMR did not reflect this state.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent interrupt masking state between DAIF and PMR.",
      "Lack of consistent environment for kernel code early in exception handling."
    ],
    "impact": "A warning would be triggered by lockdep, if DEBUG_LOCKDEP is enabled. It indicates that interrupt masking is inconsistent and could potentially lead to other issues, although no direct exploitable vulnerability is described.",
    "attack_vectors": "Not applicable in the sense of direct exploitation but rather a situation arising from specific configurations and conditions (kernel config and command line parameters).",
    "required_capabilities": "Not applicable. This is a bug triggered by specific kernel configuration and execution paths, it does not require any specific attacker position/capabilities."
  },
  "technical_details": "The fix involves setting GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR during exception entry to align PMR with DAIF's interrupt disabled state. The local_daif_inherit function was also updated to account for the PMR setting. The existing special cases that set this later in the entry code were removed, streamlining the interrupt masking process during exception handling. The patch ensures that the PMR and DAIF are consistently set to reflect the state of interrupt masking which will avoid the lockdep warning when DEBUG_LOCKDEP is enabled.",
    "fixes": [
        "Consistent setting of GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during exception entry.",
        "Update of local_daif_inherit() to manage PMR.",
        "Removal of redundant PMR setting special cases."
