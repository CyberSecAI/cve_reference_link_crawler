    "root_cause": "Insufficient escaping of line feed characters for cmd.exe on Windows.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-150"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed character (`'\\n'`) in the payload.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting a line feed character into arguments passed to any API function of Shescape when used to escape arguments for cmd.exe on Windows."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `shescape.escape`, `shescape.escapeAll`, `shescape.quote`, or `shescape.quoteAll` functions when the `shell` option is set to `cmd.exe`. This occurs when using `exec`, `execFile`, `execFileSync`, `fork`, `spawn`, and `spawnSync` if CMD is the shell being used."
