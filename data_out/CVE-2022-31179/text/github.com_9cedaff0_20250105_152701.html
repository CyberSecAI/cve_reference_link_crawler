# Insufficient escaping of line feeds for CMD

Moderate

[ericcornelissen](/ericcornelissen)
published
GHSA-jjc5-fp7p-6f8w
Jul 15, 2022

## Package

npm

shescape
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<1.5.8

## Patched versions

1.5.8

## Description

### Impact

This impacts users that use Shescape (any API function) to escape arguments for **cmd.exe** on **Windows**. An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed character (`'\n'`) in the payload. Example:

```
import cp from "node:child_process";
import * as shescape from "shescape";

// 1. Prerequisites
const options = {
  shell: "cmd.exe",
};

// 2. Attack
const payload = "attacker\n";

// 3. Usage
let escapedPayload;
escapedPayload = shescape.escape(payload, options);
// Or
escapedPayload = shescape.escapeAll([payload], options)[0];
// Or
escapedPayload = shescape.quote(payload, options);
// Or
escapedPayload = shescape.quoteAll([payload], options)[0];

cp.execSync(`echo Hello ${escapedPayload}! How are you doing?`, options);
// Outputs:  "Hello attacker"
```
> **Note**: `execSync` is just illustrative here, all of `exec`, `execFile`, `execFileSync`, `fork`, `spawn`, and `spawnSync` can be attacked using a line feed character if CMD is the shell being used.

### Patches

This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8) which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.

### Workarounds

Alternatively, line feed characters (`'\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user input can be made the last argument (this only limits the impact).
