- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Gum Elementor Addon Plugin <= 1.3.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically an injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will execute when visitors access the site. This can lead to a variety of impacts, including redirection to malicious sites, display of unwanted content, or potentially more severe attacks if combined with other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into the website through the vulnerable plugin. The specific injection point is not detailed in the provided text, but it would likely involve manipulating input fields or other data that is processed by the plugin and rendered on the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to inject scripts into the vulnerable plugin's input or data processing points, and a user with "Editor" privileges is needed to perform the attack.
