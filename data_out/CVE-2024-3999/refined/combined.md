## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EazyDocs < 2.5.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=eazydocs-settings#tab=docs-general
2. Under "Docs General" set the "Docs Slug" value as:
```
%3b" asd"`> onpointerenter=x=prompt,x`XSS` click click -@
```
3. Save the settings and navigate to Docs Builder
4. Create a new doc and a new section
5. Hover over the link icon and see the XSS
