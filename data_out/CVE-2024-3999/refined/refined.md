- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, allowing stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they interact with the affected parts of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker exploits the lack of sanitization by inserting a malicious script into the "Docs Slug" setting within the plugin's settings page. The XSS payload triggers when a user interacts with the link icon of a created doc/section.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access and modify the plugin's settings.
