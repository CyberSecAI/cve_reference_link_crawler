Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Meta Box plugin fails to properly restrict access to custom fields. It allows users with the "contributor" role or higher to access custom fields associated with posts, even if those fields were not intended for them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks sufficient access controls, enabling unauthorized disclosure of custom field data. Specifically, the shortcode `[rwmb_meta]` can be used to access any post's custom field by any authenticated user with the Contributor role or higher.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker (with at least contributor role) can access sensitive information stored in custom fields, potentially including private data, configurations, or other data not meant for public or general access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker with Contributor role or higher can insert the `[rwmb_meta]` shortcode into any post with arbitrary `object_id` and `id` parameters to reveal custom fields of other users' posts.
*   **WordPress Post Preview:** The vulnerable shortcode execution occurs when previewing or publishing a post containing the injected shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have a valid WordPress account with at least the "contributor" role.
*   **Plugin Installed:** The Meta Box plugin must be installed and active on the target WordPress site.
*  **Knowledge of Post IDs and Field Keys:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the `object_id` (post ID) and `id` (custom field key) to exploit this vulnerability.
