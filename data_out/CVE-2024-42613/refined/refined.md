The provided content contains a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Pligg CMS version 2.0.2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of CSRF protection in the `admin_widgets.php` component, specifically when installing a widget.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The application doesn't validate if the request to install a widget comes from a legitimate user action, allowing an attacker to trick a user into making unwanted actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to install a malicious widget on the Pligg CMS. This could lead to further compromise such as remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed through a malicious HTML page that includes a form that automatically sends a POST request to the vulnerable URL. When a logged-in administrator visits this malicious HTML page in a browser, the form is automatically submitted, triggering the installation of the specified widget without the user's knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing the malicious HTML page.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication to the Pligg CMS to trigger this vulnerability since it exploits the existing user session.
