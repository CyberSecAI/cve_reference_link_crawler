- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IO Module in IBM SPSS Statistics has a vulnerability where attempts to write to an unwritable location can lead to file handle leakage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** File handle leakage leading to eventual file handle exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to file handle exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors:** Writing to an unwritable location using the vulnerable IO Module of IBM SPSS Statistics.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the file writing operation, specifically targeting an unwritable location.
