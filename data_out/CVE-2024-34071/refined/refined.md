    "root_cause": "The application has an endpoint vulnerable to open redirects due to insufficient validation of the redirect URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-601"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website by crafting a URL that bypasses the protection mechanisms. This can lead to phishing or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a network attacker.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious redirect target. The user needs to be logged into the backoffice for the vulnerability to be exposed.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in multiple versions of Umbraco CMS, and is fixed by the changes introduced in the provided commits. The fix includes the usage of a new 'IsWellFormedWebPath' function to check if a URL is well-formed based on the given UriKind, and uses the built-in Uri.IsWellFormedUriString function as well, adding an additional layer of protection. The fix also accounts for scenarios where a URL starts with '//'."
