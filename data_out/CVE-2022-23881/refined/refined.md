{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the `eval` function within the `parserIfLabel()` method in `zzz_template.php`. User-controlled input from cookies, specifically the 'keys' cookie, is incorporated into a string that is subsequently evaluated by `eval` without sufficient sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized user input passed to eval.",
      "Lack of input validation and sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing attackers to take full control of the affected system. This includes running system commands, downloading malicious files, and potentially data exfiltration.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to `/index.php?location=search`",
       "Malicious code injected via the `keys` cookie."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.",
      "Ability to set and send cookies."
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when a request is made to `index.php` with the `location` parameter set to `search`. The application uses the value of the `keys` cookie to construct an expression that is then evaluated by PHP's `eval` function. The application attempts to filter dangerous keywords, but this can be bypassed by crafting appropriate payloads. The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) to execute a calculator command, and also a method to download remote files using `certutil`, further highlighting the severity of the vulnerability. The path to vulnerable code is `E:\\xxx\\zzzcms\\inc\\zzz_template.php line 1895`"
