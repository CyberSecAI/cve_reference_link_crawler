- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can persuade a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject the malicious payloads into a webpage that a user of the vulnerable device's web interface might visit. The attacker does not need to authenticate to the vulnerable device.
