The provided content relates to CVE-2024-37625.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of the `$search` parameter in multiple PHP files (`html/index.php`, `html/pay.php`, and `html/own.php`) of the iBarn v1.5 application. Although the `htmlspecialchars` function is used for encoding, the flag `ENT_NOQUOTES` is used, which does not encode single or double quotes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate input sanitization. Specifically, the use of `htmlspecialchars` with `ENT_NOQUOTES` allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code by manipulating the search parameter. Additionally, other files (`shareme.php`, `recycle.php`, `collection.php`, `pub.php`, `myshare.php`) also lack filtering for the search parameter, leading to more XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by crafting a URL with a specially crafted `search` parameter. When a user visits this URL, the injected JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
* Session hijacking
* Stealing cookies
* Redirecting users to malicious websites
* Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript in the `search` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious payload and have a victim user visit that URL.
