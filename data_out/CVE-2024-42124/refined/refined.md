The provided content is related to the identified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from calling `smp_processor_id()` within the `qedf_execute_tmf()` function, which is called from preemptible code. This is problematic because `smp_processor_id()` is intended to be used in non-preemptible contexts and can lead to a BUG_ON() when a real-time (RT) kernel is in use, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect use of `smp_processor_id()` in a preemptible context.
- The code was not designed to be compatible with RT kernels.
- Lack of proper synchronization when using `smp_processor_id()`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash or BUG_ON.
- System instability, especially in RT kernel environments.
- Potential disruption of storage operations due to a crash in the qedf driver.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `qedf_execute_tmf()` function in a scenario involving a real-time (RT) kernel. The function is typically called as part of task management operations related to SCSI devices.
- The specific scenario where this would be triggered could be through initiating a SCSI task management function (TMF).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger SCSI task management functions, implying access to a system where qedf is loaded.
- Running a real-time kernel where the timing-related assumptions of `smp_processor_id()` are violated

**Technical Details:**
The provided diffs show the fix for this vulnerability. The core of the problem was that the line `io_req->cpu = smp_processor_id();` was being called before acquiring the `rport_lock`, which makes the code preemptible. The fix moves that line after the lock is acquired, ensuring it is non-preemptible. Specifically:
- The problematic line `io_req->cpu = smp_processor_id();` was moved from before the `spin_lock_irqsave` to after the lock is acquired.
- This ensures that the call to `smp_processor_id()` now occurs within a non-preemptible code block.
- `sqe_idx = qedf_get_sqe_idx(fcport);` and `sqe = &fcport->sq[sqe_idx]; memset(sqe, 0, sizeof(struct fcoe_wqe));` are not related to the vulnerability but were moved as part of a code cleanup.

The log messages from the commits highlight the issue:

```
[ 659.343280] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: sg_reset/3646
[ 659.343282] caller is qedf_execute_tmf+0x8b/0x360 [qedf]
```
This shows that the bug occurs within the `sg_reset` function, which calls `qedf_execute_tmf`, and that the issue is indeed related to the use of `smp_processor_id` in a preemptible context.
