### Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-7401. It describes a Netskope Client enrollment bypass vulnerability due to the usage of a static token ("Orgkey") as an authentication parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Netskope client enrollment process used a static token as authentication, which, if leaked, could not be revoked or rotated, allowing a malicious actor to impersonate and enroll.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of static, non-rotatable, non-revocable authentication token during client enrollment.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious actor could enroll Netskope client using leaked token from a customer's tenant and impersonate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Obtaining a leaked static token.
- Using the static token to enroll Netskope client from a customer's tenant

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs the leaked static "Orgkey" token.
- Attacker requires knowledge of the tenant URL to enroll.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by enforcing "Secure Enrollment," which mandates strict authentication parameters during client enrollment.
- Netskope recommends enabling "Enforce authentication of Netskope Client Enrollment" and optionally "Enforce encryption of initial configuration of Netskope client" in all tenants.
- Multi-token support is introduced with version 122.0.0, allowing the creation of multiple authentication and encryption tokens.
