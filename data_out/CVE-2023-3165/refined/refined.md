{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `nominee_id` parameter before storing it in the database. When the data is later displayed on the `nominee.php` page, it is rendered without proper encoding, leading to XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement of the web page.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted POST request to `/lims/insertNominee.php` with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `nominee_id` parameter. The payload will be executed when a user visits `/lims/nominee.php`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to `/lims/insertNominee.php`. No other specific capabilities or special positions are mentioned"
