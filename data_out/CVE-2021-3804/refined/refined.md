Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-3804 (based on the commit message mentioning "Security fix for ReDoS")

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a regular expression used for URL validation, specifically in the `REG_URL` constant within the `packages/taro-helper/src/constants.ts` file. The original regex was susceptible to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS:** The original regular expression ` /^(?:(?:(?:https?|ftp):)?\/\/)(?:\S+(?::\S*)?@)?(?:(?!(?:10|127)(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})(?!(?:169\.254|192\.168)(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?!172\.(?:1[6-9]|2\d|3[0-1])(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[01]\d|22[0-3])(?:\.(?:1?\d{1,2}|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])){2}(?:\.(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-4]))|(?:(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]-\*)\*[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]+)(?:\.(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]-\*)\*[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]+)\*(?:\.(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff]{2,}))\.?)(?::\d{2,5})?(?:[/?#]\S*)?$/i ` was vulnerable to ReDoS. The `(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]-\*)\*[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]+` pattern (specifically the `-\*)\*`) could cause catastrophic backtracking when processing carefully crafted, malicious input strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A successful ReDoS attack could lead to a denial of service by causing the application to become unresponsive due to excessive CPU consumption while trying to validate malicious URLs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL Input:** An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted URL string that causes the vulnerable regular expression to perform extensive backtracking, thus consuming excessive processing resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to provide the malicious URL string to the application where this vulnerable regex is used. The specific context depends on how this regex is used in the `taro` project (e.g. user input validation, parsing URLs in configuration files).

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves modifying the `REG_URL` regular expression to  `/^(?:(?:(?:https?|ftp):)?\/\/)(?:\S+(?::\S*)?@)?(?:(?!(?:10|127)(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})(?!(?:169\.254|192\.168)(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?!172\.(?:1[6-9]|2\d|3[0-1])(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[01]\d|22[0-3])(?:\.(?:1?\d{1,2}|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])){2}(?:\.(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-4]))|(?:(?:[a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff][a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff\_-]{0,62})?[a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff]\.)+(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff]{2,}\.?))(?::\d{2,5})?(?:[/?#]\S*)?$/i`. This updated regex replaces the vulnerable part with a more robust pattern `(?:(?:[a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff][a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff_-]{0,62})?[a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff]\.)+`, which should prevent catastrophic backtracking and address the ReDoS vulnerability.
