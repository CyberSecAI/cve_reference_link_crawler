RELATED: The provided content discusses Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in multiple WordPress plugins, including "Feed Them Social â€“ Page, Post, Video, and Photo Galleries" plugin which is directly related to CVE-2020-36739.

- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `my_fts_fb_load_more()` function of the Feed Them Social plugin. This function is responsible for handling "load more" requests. Instead of strictly verifying the nonce, the vulnerable code only checks if the nonce is set, not if the nonce is valid.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - CSRF vulnerability due to inadequate nonce verification.
  - The plugin uses a nonce for security checks, but the implementation fails because it doesn't verify that the nonce is valid.
  - The code uses a conditional statement `if ( isset( $_REQUEST['fts_security'], $_REQUEST['fts_time'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( ... ) )` which only checks if the nonce fields are set. If they are not set, the validation is bypassed.

- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can trick a site administrator into performing unintended actions by crafting a malicious request with a forged nonce and convincing the admin to click the link. This could allow the attacker to load arbitrary social media feeds on the site, potentially leading to data leakage, settings changes, or other unauthorized modifications.

- Attack vectors:
  - The attack is performed by exploiting a CSRF vulnerability, which typically involves an attacker tricking a user into executing actions they did not intend.
  - The attack can be launched by embedding a crafted request in an email, a web page, or other medium that a logged-in administrator is likely to interact with.
  - This method of attack doesn't require direct access to the server.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link that makes a request to the vulnerable site.
  - No direct access to the server is required; the attacker just needs to be able to send the crafted request.
  - The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated on the target website but needs a victim who is authenticated on the target website.
