- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing PNG files. Specifically, the software copies user-provided data to a fixed-length heap-based buffer without verifying its length.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious PNG file that triggers the vulnerability when parsed by Kofax Power PDF. The user must open this malicious file or visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PNG file that exploits the buffer overflow vulnerability. The attacker needs to get the user to open the file or access the malicious content.
