    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote low-privileged attacker can execute APIs intended for Admin Users on the application's backend database, potentially allowing unauthorized access to restricted resources and changes of state.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit the exposed internal maintenance REST API.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user and the internal maintenance REST API must be enabled by an Admin user from the UI."
