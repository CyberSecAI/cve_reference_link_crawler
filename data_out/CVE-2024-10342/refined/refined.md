- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, leading to potential malicious actions performed within the user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the use of shortcodes within the League of Legends Shortcodes plugin for WordPress.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level or higher permissions on the WordPress site.
