- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not described, but it involves exploiting the missing access control in a function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user.
