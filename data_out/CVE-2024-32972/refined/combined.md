    …

   ```
   …mplement gentrie ([#29313](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29313))

   This pull request defines a gentrie for snap sync purpose.

   The stackTrie is used to generate the merkle tree nodes upon receiving a state batch. Several additional options have been added into stackTrie to handle incomplete states (either missing states before or after).

   In this pull request, these options have been relocated from stackTrie to genTrie, which serves as a wrapper for stackTrie specifically for snap sync purposes.

   Further, the logic for managing incomplete state has been enhanced in this change. Originally, there are two cases handled:

   -    boundary node filtering
   -    internal (covered by extension node) node clearing

   This changes adds one more:

   - Clearing leftover nodes on the boundaries.

   This feature is necessary if there are leftover trie nodes in database, otherwise node inconsistency may break the state healing.
   ```

# DoS via malicious p2p message

High

[holiman](/holiman)
published
GHSA-4xc9-8hmq-j652
May 6, 2024

## Package

gomod

go-ethereum
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<1.13.15

## Patched versions

1.13.15

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerable node can be made to consume very large amounts of memory when handling specially crafted p2p messages sent from an attacker node.

In order to carry out the attack, the attacker establishes a peer connections to the victim, and sends a malicious `GetBlockHeadersRequest` message with a `count` of `0`, using the `ETH` protocol.

In `descendants := chain.GetHeadersFrom(num+count-1, count-1)`, the value of `count-1` is passed to the function `GetHeadersFrom(number, count uint64)` as parameter `count`. Due to integer overflow, `UINT64_MAX` value is then passed as the `count` argument to function `GetHeadersFrom(number, count uint64)`. This allows an attacker to bypass `maxHeadersServe` and request all headers from the latest block back to the genesis block.

### Patches

The fix has been included in geth version `1.13.15` and onwards.

The vulnerability was patched in: [#29534](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29534)

### Workarounds

No workarounds have been made public.

### References

No more information is released at this time.

### Credit

This issue was disclosed responsibly by DongHan Kim via the Ethereum bug bounty program. Thank you for your cooperation.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-32972

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
