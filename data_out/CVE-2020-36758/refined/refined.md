{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `save_feedzy_post_type_meta()` function of the RSS Aggregator by Feedzy plugin. The code checks if a nonce is set and valid but does not have proper handling when the nonce is missing. This allows requests to pass without proper verification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
       "Missing nonce validation",
      "Incorrect nonce validation logic"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability to update post meta by forging a request and tricking a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking on a link.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Forged HTTP request",
      "Social engineering of a site administrator to perform an action"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a crafted link). No other specific capabilities are needed.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is specifically located in the `save_feedzy_post_type_meta()` function, which lacks proper nonce handling. The patched code modifies the condition, making sure that the nonce is validated if the parameter is sent, no matter the value. The vulnerable versions are <= 3.4.2."
