{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a command injection vulnerability in the `cgi_del_photo` function within the `/cgi-bin/photocenter_mgr.cgi` file. The `current_path` variable, received from a POST request, is not properly sanitized before being used in a system command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection",
    "Buffer Overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/cgi-bin/photocenter_mgr.cgi` containing a malicious value for the `current_path` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device's web interface."
