Based on the provided information, this document describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC8 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `formSetDeviceName` function.
- The function reads user-controlled input `DevName` without any length validation, which is then used as an argument for `set_device_name` function.
- Inside `set_device_name`, the user-controlled input is copied into a local variable using `sprintf` without proper bounds checking, resulting in a stack overflow if the input is too long.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to missing bounds check on user-controlled input within `sprintf`.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation on the `DevName` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to the stack overflow.
- An attacker can potentially gain arbitrary code execution if the stack overflow is exploited carefully.
- The document claims that it is possible to achieve a very stable root shell using an exploit.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetOnlineDevName` endpoint with a long value in the `devName` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target device, implying network access to the router, which could be via the local network or if the web interface is exposed to the internet.
- The attacker should have some knowledge of the device's API to send the crafted HTTP request.
