- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-122, which is a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` indicates the following:
    -   **AV:L (Local):** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
    -   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low, meaning the vulnerability is easy to exploit.
    -   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
    -   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required, which means the user needs to perform some action for the exploit to occur.
    -  **S:U (Unchanged):** The scope is Unchanged, meaning a vulnerability in one software component does not impact other components.
    -   **C:H (High):** Confidentiality impact is high, meaning the attacker can gain access to sensitive information.
    -   **I:H (High):** Integrity impact is high, meaning the attacker can modify data or system configuration.
    -   **A:H (High):** Availability impact is high, meaning the attacker can cause a denial of service or otherwise make the system unavailable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system and requires the user to interact with a malicious file or action to trigger the vulnerability.
