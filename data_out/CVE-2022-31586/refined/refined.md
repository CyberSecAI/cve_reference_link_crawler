The provided content contains a detailed discussion about a path traversal vulnerability in multiple Flask applications, specifically related to the use of `flask.send_file` and `os.path.join`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The primary vulnerability stems from using `flask.send_file` with user-controlled input (`filename` parameter) without proper sanitization.
- Additionally, the use of `os.path.join` with untrusted input can be exploited. When `os.path.join` encounters an absolute path, it discards prior path segments, allowing an attacker to provide an absolute path to traverse directories.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal (Directory Traversal):**  Attackers can access files outside of the intended web root directory by manipulating file paths using "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences or absolute file paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files, including application source code, configuration files, and critical system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
- **Potential Partial Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could make multiple requests to access large files, potentially leading to a partial denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through web interfaces where file paths are accepted as parameters (e.g., `filename` or `path` parameters in HTTP requests).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker must be able to control the input parameters related to file paths.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Additional Details:**

The discussion also highlights:

- **Remediation:**  The vulnerability can be fixed by either using `flask.safe_join` to sanitize untrusted paths or using `flask.send_from_directory` to restrict file access to a specific directory.
- **CodeQL:** The vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL analysis tool.
- **CVEs assigned and disputed:** The discussion contains strong disagreement about the validity of assigning CVEs to personal or academic projects that are not meant to be consumed by other parties. It highlights the issues with some dependency-check tools and the importance of accurate CPE data.
- **Coordinated Disclosure:** The report was rejected by GitHub security team, as the researcher published the issues and fixes publicly instead of following a coordinated disclosure process with the maintainers first.
- **CVSS score:** The commit message for NickHastings/ganga mentions CVSS v3.1 vector (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L) with a base score of 9.3, categorizing the vulnerability as critical.
