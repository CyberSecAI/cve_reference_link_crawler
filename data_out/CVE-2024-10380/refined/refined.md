**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL Injection in the `ajax_product.php` file of the SourceCodester Petrol Pump Management Software v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL Injection vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `id` parameter of the `ajax_product.php` file via a crafted HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the web application, specifically to the vulnerable `ajax_product.php` file. No specific user role is mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability might be exploitable without authentication, but it is not explicitly stated.
