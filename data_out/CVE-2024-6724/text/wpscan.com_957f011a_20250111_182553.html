## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Generate Images – Magic Post Thumbnail < 5.2.8 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to /wp-admin/admin.php?page=magic-post-thumbnail-admin-display&module=source and modify the vulnerable fields listed below with the payload `<img src=123 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`
2. Vulnerable Fields:
- Google Image (API) -> Custom Search Engine ID
- Google Image (API) -> Google API Key
- DALLE-E (v3) -> API Key
- Pixabay -> Pixabay username
- Pixabay -> Api key
3. Navigate to /wp-admin/admin.php?page=magic-post-thumbnail-admin-display&module=logs to observe executed payload.
