Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a confused authorization logic within the Apache OFBiz controller-view component. Specifically, the system did not properly check user permissions before rendering views, leading to a "Direct Request" or "Forced Browsing" vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The system failed to verify if a user had the necessary permissions before granting access to rendered views.
- **Forced Browsing:** This vulnerability enables attackers to bypass intended access controls and view content that they shouldn't be able to see by directly requesting specific views/maps.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data or functionality by directly requesting views without proper authorization. This could result in information disclosure or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request/Forced Browsing:** An attacker could craft specific requests to directly access views without going through the intended authorization mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the URLs or parameters used for accessing the views in order to make direct requests.
- No authentication is mentioned as required. It's a pre-auth issue (i.e., authorization failure occurs before authN is established).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by adding proper permission checks to the view-maps and changing default values for "auth" and "https" parameters in request-maps to "true".
- The affected versions of Apache OFBiz are before 18.12.16.
- This CVE has been assigned the severity rating of "important".
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 18.12.16.
- The fix involved changes to both the `ofbiz-framework` and `ofbiz-plugins` repositories, specifically pull requests #831 and #126.
