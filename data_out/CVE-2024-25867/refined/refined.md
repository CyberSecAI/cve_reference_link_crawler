Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `add_type.php` file within the Membership Management System. Specifically, the `membershipType` and `membershipAmount` parameters are directly used in SQL queries without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers can read sensitive data from the database.
*   Attackers can modify database data (insert, update, delete).
*   Attackers can execute administrative operations on the database.
*   Attackers can potentially recover the content of files on the DBMS file system.
*   In some cases, attackers can issue commands to the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `add_type.php` file. The malicious SQL code is injected into the `membershipType` and/or `membershipAmount` parameters within the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `add_type.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or a privileged network position.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's structure (e.g., parameters names).

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided text includes proof-of-concept (PoC) steps using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the exploit.
*   It is also mentioned that the PHPSESSID cookie value needs to be updated in the request before using the `sqlmap` tool, which means that the targeted system has a form of authentication.
