**VULNERABILITY DETAILS**

Rockwell Automation used the latest versions of the CVSS scoring system to assess the following vulnerabilities. The following vulnerabilities were reported to us by Sharon Brizinov of Claroty Research - Team82.

A feature in the affected products enables users to prepare a project file with an embedded VBA script and can be configured to run once the project file has been opened without user intervention.  This feature can be abused to trick a legitimate user into executing malicious code upon opening an infected RSP/RSS project file. If exploited, a threat actor may be able to perform a remote code execution. Connected devices may also be impacted by exploitation of this vulnerability.
