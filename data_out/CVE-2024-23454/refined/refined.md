Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23454:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Apache Hadoop's `RunJar.run()` method not setting proper permissions on temporary directories by default. Specifically, it fails to set specific POSIX permissions when creating temporary files in a shared system directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The core weakness is the creation of temporary files in a shared directory (`/tmp` on Unix-like systems) without setting restrictive permissions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Because the permissions are not set correctly, other local users can potentially read the contents of these temporary files if sensitive data is present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows local users to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information that might be stored in temporary files created by Hadoop's `RunJar.run()` method.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the affected system, because the vulnerability affects how temporary files are created and accessed by different local users on the same system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the same system where the vulnerable Hadoop instance is running.
*   **No Elevated Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't require any special privileges or elevated access to exploit the vulnerability because the issue is related to the shared file system permissions and that the files are readable by other users.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Apache Hadoop versions prior to 3.4.0 are affected.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is resolved in Hadoop versions 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.
*   **NetApp's Stance:** NetApp has acknowledged the vulnerability in its products but states that none of its products are affected. This likely means that either they don't use the vulnerable part of Hadoop or have implemented mitigations.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as 6.2 (MEDIUM) with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`.

In summary, CVE-2024-23454 is a local information disclosure vulnerability in Apache Hadoop due to insecure temporary file creation.
