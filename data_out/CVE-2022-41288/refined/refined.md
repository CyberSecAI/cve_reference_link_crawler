- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `CGM_NIST_Loader.dll` contains a stack exhaustion vulnerability when parsing a CGM file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack exhaustion due to uncontrolled resource allocation when processing a CGM file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by enticing a user to open a specially crafted CGM file with the affected application (JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CGM file to a user of the affected application. No specific privileges are needed, but user interaction is required.
