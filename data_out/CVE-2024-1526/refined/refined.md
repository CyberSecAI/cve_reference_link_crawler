The provided content relates to CVE-2024-1526.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to verify user access to password-protected posts before displaying their content within a meta tag. Specifically, when the "Disable Open Graph Meta Tags" setting is off, the content of password-protected posts is disclosed in the "og:description" meta property tag.

    - **Information Disclosure:** Content intended to be private is exposed via the `og:description` meta tag.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized disclosure of password-protected post content. An attacker can view the content of posts without providing the correct password.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is network-based.
    - An attacker can view the source code of a password-protected post if "Disable Open Graph Meta Tags" setting is disabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs no special capabilities and can be an unauthenticated user.
    - The attacker needs to be able to access the publicly accessible webpage.
