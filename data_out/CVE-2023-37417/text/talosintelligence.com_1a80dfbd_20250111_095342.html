# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1804

## GTKWave VCD parse\_valuechange portdump out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-37416,CVE-2023-37419,CVE-2023-37420,CVE-2023-37418,CVE-2023-37417

##### SUMMARY

Multiple out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities exist in the VCD parse\_valuechange portdump functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .vcd file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-787 - Out-of-bounds Write

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It includes a GUI to view and analyze traces, as well as convert across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions.

VCD (Value Change Dump) files are parsed by the `vcd_parse` function. This function is duplicated in several conversion utilities (`vcd2lxt`, `vcd2lxt2`, `vcd2vzt`) and in the GUI portion of GTKWave. In general the various implementations are very similar or identical, but in some cases they differ enough to not allow the issue described in this advisory to be triggered. For example, this issue is not present in the `vcd_parse` function in `vcd_recorder.c`.

Let’s describe the execution flow for the `vcd2lxt` utility; the other implementations have very similar behavior.

The function `vcd_parse` loops over each line in the file [1]. Depending on which token has been read [2], a different switch block is executed:

```
     static void vcd_parse(int linear) {
         int tok;

[1]      for (;;) {
[2]          switch (get_token()) {
                 ...

```

The `get_token()` function simply extracts a token from the file at the current cursor position, saving it to the global `yytext` buffer and assigning the token’s length to the global `yylen`.

Moreover, if the token does not start with “$”, the token is considered a special symbol, and it has to match one of these tokens:

```
char *tokens[] = {"var", "end", "scope", "upscope",
                  "comment", "date", "dumpall", "dumpoff", "dumpon",
                  "dumpvars", "enddefinitions",
                  "dumpports", "dumpportsoff", "dumpportson", "dumpportsall",
                  "timescale", "version", "vcdclose", "timezero",
                  "", "", ""};

```

The return value of `get_token` is a token type, which is an index inside the `tokens` array above.

If the token does not start with “$”, the token is considered a string and the returned token type will be `T_STRING`.

Going back to the `switch` above, if the parsed token is “$var”, the token type will be `T_VAR` and we will enter the block at [3]:

```
[3]  case T_VAR: {
         int vtok;
         struct vcdsymbol *v = NULL;

         var_prevch = 0;
         ...
[4]      vtok = get_vartoken(1);

```

A new token is read using `get_vartoken()` [5] and saved into `vtok`.

This function, similarly to `get_token()`, extracts a token from the file, separated by any of “ “, “\t”, “\n”, or “\r”.

If `match_kw` (the first argument to the function) is 1, then the token is matched against the `vartypes` array and the return value is set to the matching index inside it:

```
static char *vartypes[] = {"event", "parameter",
                           "integer", "real", "real_parameter", "realtime", "string", "reg", "supply0",
                           "supply1", "time", "tri", "triand", "trior",
                           "trireg", "tri0", "tri1", "wand", "wire", "wor", "port", "in", "out", "inout",
                           "$end", "", "", "", ""};

```

Going on with the `T_VAR` case. Our token needs to be “port” or any of the other symbols before it [5]:

```
         ...
[5]      if (vtok > V_PORT) goto bail;

[6]      v = (struct vcdsymbol *)calloc_2(1, sizeof(struct vcdsymbol));
         v->vartype = vtok;
         v->msi = v->lsi = vcd_explicit_zero_subscripts; /* indicate [un]subscripted status */

         if (vtok == V_PORT) {
             ...
         } else /* regular vcd var, not an evcd port var */
         {
[7]          vtok = get_vartoken(1);
             if (vtok == V_END) goto err;
[7]          v->size = atoi_64(yytext);
[8]          vtok = get_strtoken();
             if (vtok == V_END) goto err;
             v->id = (char *)malloc_2(yylen + 1);
[8]          strcpy(v->id, yytext);
             v->nid = vcdid_hash(yytext, yylen);

             if (v->nid < vcd_minid) vcd_minid = v->nid;
             if (v->nid > vcd_maxid) vcd_maxid = v->nid;

[9]          vtok = get_vartoken(0);
             if (vtok != V_STRING) goto err;
             if (slisthier_len) {
                ...
             } else {
                 v->name = (char *)malloc_2(yylen + 1);
[9]              strcpy(v->name, yytext);
             }

[10]          vtok = get_vartoken(1);
             if (vtok == V_END) goto dumpv;
             ...
         }

```

A series of tokens is then extracted to populate the `vcdsymbol` pointed by `v` [6], in this order:

* [7] v->size (integer) is the size of this symbol
* [8] v->id is a string representing the symbol ID
* [9] v->name is a string representing the name of this symbol
* [10] the declaration must end with the string “$end”

The code then continues by populating `v->value` and `v->narray`:

```
     dumpv:
         ...

         /* initial conditions */
[11]     v->value = (char *)malloc_2(v->size + 1);
         v->value[v->size] = 0;
         v->narray = (struct Node **)calloc_2(v->size, sizeof(struct Node *));
         {
             int i;
             for (i = 0; i < v->size; i++) {
[12]             v->value[i] = 'x';

                 v->narray[i] = (struct Node *)calloc_2(1, sizeof(struct Node));
                 v->narray[i]->head.time = -1;
                 v->narray[i]->head.v.val = 1;
             }
         }

         ...

[13]    if (!vcdsymroot) {
            vcdsymroot = vcdsymcurr = v;
        } else {
            vcdsymcurr->next = v;
            vcdsymcurr = v;
        }
        numsyms++;

         ...

     bail:
         if (vtok != V_END) sync_end(NULL);
         break;
     }

```

`v->value` is allocated with a size of `v->size + 1` [11] before it is initialized with “x” characters [12] and null-terminated.

Finally, the new `v` symbol is added to the symbols list [13] and `numsyms` is incremented. Here the case block ends and we go back to the loop at [1].

The next token is read; if it matches “$enddefinitions” the switch block at [14] is entered.

```
[14] case T_ENDDEFINITIONS:
         if (!header_over) {
[15]         header_over = 1; /* do symbol table management here */
             create_sorted_table();
             if ((!sorted) && (!indexed)) {
                 fprintf(stderr, "No symbols in VCD file..nothing to do!\n");
                 exit(1);
             }

             if (linear) lt_set_no_interlace(lt);
         }
         break;

```

At [15], the variable `header_over` is set to 1. This is important, because this variable must be set to 1 in order to call the `parse_valuechange()` function in the next step.

At this point, we go back to the loop at [1].

The next token is read. If it’s a string, we enter the switch block at [16].

```
     case T_STRING:
[16]     if (header_over) {
             /* catchall for events when header over */
[17]         if (yytext[0] == '#') {
                ...
             } else {
[18]             parse_valuechange();
             }
         }
         break;

```

If `header_over` is 1 [16] and the string does not start with “#” [17], the function `parse_valuechange()` is called.

```
     static void parse_valuechange(void) {
         struct vcdsymbol *v;
         char *vector;
         int vlen;

         switch (yytext[0]) {
             ...
[19]         case 'p':
                 /* extract port dump value.. */
[20]             vector = malloc_2(yylen_cache = yylen);
                 strcpy(vector, yytext + 1);
                 vlen = yylen - 1;

[21]             get_strtoken(); /* throw away 0_strength_component */
                 get_strtoken(); /* throw away 0_strength_component */
                 get_strtoken(); /* this is the id                  */
[22]             v = bsearch_vcd(yytext, yylen);
                 if (!v) {
                     fprintf(stderr, "Near line %d, Unknown identifier: '%s'\n", vcdlineno, yytext);
                     free_2(vector);
                 } else {
[23]                 if (vlen < v->size) /* fill in left part */
                     {
                         char extend;
                         int i, fill;

                         extend = '0';

                         fill = v->size - vlen;
                         for (i = 0; i < fill; i++) {
                             v->value[i] = extend;
                         }
                         evcd_strcpy(v->value + fill, vector);
                     }
                     ...

                     if ((v->size == 1) || (!atomic_vectors)) {
                        ...
                     } else {
[24]                     if (yylen_cache < v->size) {
                             free_2(vector);
[25]                         vector = malloc_2(v->size + 1);
                         }
[26]                     strcpy(vector, v->value);
                         add_histent(current_time, v->narray[0], 0, 1, vector);
                         free_2(vector);
                     }
                 }
                 break;
             ...
         }
     }

```

If the token starts with the letter “p”, we enter the block at [19].

The array `vector` is allocated with a size of `yylen` (the size of the token string, excluding the null terminator) [20]. `vlen` is then assigned a value of `yylen - 1`, which is the length of the string after “p” (again without the null terminator).

Two tokens are then extracted and discarded [21]. Finally the `id` token is extracted and searched for in the `vcdsymbol`’s list [22]. If found, the resulting `vcdsymbol` is then pointed by `v`.

At [23], if `vlen` is smaller than `v->size`, this means that the string in vector is not big enough to fill the whole `v->value` buffer, so it is padded with zeros.

Then, the padded string is copied back to vector, and at [24] the code attempts to make sure the string will fit in `vector`, reallocating if necessary [25].
Finally, the padded `v->value` is copied back to `vector`.

The problem in this code is the check at [24]: `yylen_cache` is the size of `vector`, and `v->size` is the length of the `v->value` string. So, to copy the `v->value` string into `vector` safely, `vector` needs to have a size of `vsize-> + 1`. The check at [24] only reallocates if `vector` has a size smaller than `vsize`, whereas it should check for `yylen_cache <= v->size`. This allows the `strcpy` to write one NULL byte out-of-bounds in the heap, which, with careful heap massaging (which looks feasible, as allocations in this parser can be easily controlled via the file contents), an attacker can abuse to execute arbitrary code.

As mentioned before, this issue affects 5 different source files listed separately below.

#### CVE-2023-37416 - VCD GUI legacy

The GUI’s legacy VCD parsing code incorrectly checks the buffer size at line `src/vcd.c:965`, leading to a NULL byte out-of-bounds write in heap.

This can be triggered by using the `-L` flag when starting GTKWave.

#### CVE-2023-37417 - VCD GUI interactive

The GUI’s interactive VCD parsing code incorrectly checks the buffer size at line `src/vcd_partial.c:901`, leading to a NULL byte out-of-bounds write in heap.

This can be triggered by using the `-I` flag when starting GTKWave.

#### CVE-2023-37418 - vcd2vzt

The `vcd2vzt` conversion utility incorrectly checks the buffer size at line `src/helpers/vcd2vzt.c:935`, leading to a NULL byte out-of-bounds write in heap.

#### CVE-2023-37419 - vcd2lxt2

The `vcd2lxt2` conversion utility incorrectly checks the buffer size at line `src/helpers/vcd2lxt2.c:933`, leading to a NULL byte out-of-bounds write in heap.

#### CVE-2023-37420 - vcd2lxt

The `vcd2lxt` conversion utility incorrectly checks the buffer size at line `src/helpers/vcd2lxt.c:928`, leading to a NULL byte out-of-bounds write in heap.
