- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `key` parameter within the `setWiFiExtenderConfig` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or further compromise of the victim's system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed through the "Repeater Setting" page where users can configure Wi-Fi extension. The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code within the `key` parameter during the Wi-Fi extension configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the TOTOLINK EX200 device and be able to manipulate the `key` parameter, during the "Repeater Setting" process.
