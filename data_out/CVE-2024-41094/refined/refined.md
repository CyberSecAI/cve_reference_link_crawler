{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The fbdev-dma driver was incorrectly setting the `smem_start` field of the `fb_info` structure when the underlying memory was allocated via vmalloc. The `smem_start` field is expected to hold the physical address of the framebuffer, but `vmalloc` memory does not guarantee contiguous physical addresses and thus cannot be converted to a single physical address. This resulted in the driver passing a virtual address to `virt_to_phys` which expects a linear address.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect physical address calculation due to the use of vmalloced memory. The driver was using `virt_to_phys` with non-linear memory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The incorrect use of virt_to_phys with non linear address leads to kernel warnings and could lead to undefined behavior when accessing the frame buffer memory. The kernel warning indicates that it is not safe to convert a non linear address to a physical one, due to the potential to not return the correct physical address.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a framebuffer is created using the fbdev-dma driver with DMA memory backed by vmalloc address space.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger the creation of a framebuffer using the fbdev-dma driver with DMA memory backed by vmalloc address space. This is often within reach of a local user as most DRM drivers will create framebuffers on demand."
