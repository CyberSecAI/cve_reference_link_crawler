Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-6551:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to the GiveWP WordPress plugin using Symfony and having `display_errors` enabled within test files. Specifically, the `common.inc` file used in testing includes the line `ini_set('display_errors', 1);`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Full Path Disclosure: The enabled `display_errors` setting in the test file causes the full server path of the web application to be displayed when accessing the file through a web request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of the web application's full path. This information, while not directly exploitable, can assist attackers in planning more complex attacks. It can be used to map the directory structure of a website.
- Information leakage is the primary impact. The vulnerability is considered medium severity because it requires an additional vulnerability to be present for significant damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can access the vulnerable test file directly through a web request. This file is located in a publicly accessible directory within the plugin's structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint. No prior authentication is required, making it remotely exploitable by anyone with network access to the web server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in GiveWP plugin versions up to and including 3.15.1.
- The issue was fixed in version 3.16.0 by presumably disabling the `display_errors` setting in the test file.
- The file `common.inc` is located at `/vendor/vendor-prefixed/symfony/http-foundation/Tests/Fixtures/response-functional/common.inc`.
