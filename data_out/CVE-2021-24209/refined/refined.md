Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate user-supplied input for the cache location path within the WP Super Cache plugin settings page. Specifically, the `wp_cache_location` POST parameter was not sufficiently sanitized.
*   Weak checks on the `$cache_path` variable allowed for manipulation that could lead to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin doesn't adequately sanitize the `wp_cache_location` input, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
*   **Weak Path Check:** The check for the cache path was flawed, permitting directory traversal and code injection. The original code used `if ( $dir == false )` which was changed to `if ( $dir === realpath( '.' ) || false === $dir )`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By injecting malicious code into the cache path, attackers can achieve RCE, gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site.
*   **Web Shell Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited to inject a web shell into the `wp-cache-config.php` file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:**  Attackers send a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wpsupercache&tab=settings` endpoint.
*   **Malicious `wp_cache_location` Parameter:** The payload is injected via the `wp_cache_location` POST parameter in the form of a malicious path, embedding PHP code.
*   **Exploitation via XSS:** The vulnerability could be chained with an XSS vulnerability in another plugin to achieve RCE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative access (or higher) to the WordPress site to modify the plugin settings.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `wp-cache.php` file within the WP Super Cache plugin.
*   The fix includes improved validation and sanitization of the cache path.
*   The exploit involves injecting PHP code into the `wp_cache_location` parameter, which is then written to the `wp-cache-config.php` file. This modified file is then included, executing the attacker's code.

**Summary of Changes in `wp-cache.php`:**

The following changes were made in `wp-cache.php` to fix the vulnerability:

*   The code originally used `if ( $dir == false )` to check if the directory is invalid. This was changed to  `if ( $dir === realpath( '.' ) || false === $dir )` to improve the check.
*   The code also changed how the cache path was written to the configuration file. Instead of concatenating a string, it now uses `var_export` to properly serialize the value: `wp_cache_replace_line('^ \*\$cache\_path', "\$cache\_path = " . var\_export( $cache\_path, true ) . ";", $wp\_cache\_config\_file);`

This makes it much harder for an attacker to inject code into the configuration file.
