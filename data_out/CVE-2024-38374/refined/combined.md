# Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-core-java

High

[jkowalleck](/jkowalleck)
published
GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8
Jun 24, 2024

## Package

maven

org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-core-java
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 2.1.0, < 9.0.4

## Patched versions

9.0.4

## Description

### Impact

Before deserializing CycloneDX Bill of Materials in XML format, *cyclonedx-core-java* leverages XPath expressions to determine the schema version of the BOM. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

XXE injection can be exploited to exfiltrate local file content, or perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to access infrastructure adjacent to the vulnerable application.

### PoC

```
import org.cyclonedx.parsers.XmlParser;

class Poc {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Will throw org.cyclonedx.exception.ParseException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
        new XmlParser().parse("""
            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
            <!DOCTYPE bom [<!ENTITY % sp SYSTEM "https://localhost:1010/does-not-exist/file.dtd"> %sp;]>
            <bom xmlns="http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom/1.5"/>
            """.getBytes());
    }

}
```
### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in *cyclonedx-core-java* version 0.9.4.

### Workarounds

If feasible, applications can reject XML documents before handing them to *cyclonedx-core-java* for parsing.

This may be an option if incoming CycloneDX BOMs are known to be in JSON format.

### References

* Issue was fixed via [#434](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/pull/434)
* Issue was introduced via [162aa59](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/commit/162aa594f347b3f612fe0a45071693c3cd398ce9)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

During some testing, it was found that the parser for XML was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Processing.

After further investigation from Sonatype team, it was found it was due to the XPath Processing done to get the schema version

Sorry, something went wrong.

This is a good fix. However, I am not sure why a core library has to take a position to disable all use of DTD. What if an organization legitimately needs them especially for external references etc? Best to expose these as non-breaking settings and make it clear that users and applications are responsible for security and cannot offload security to core libraries.

I thought about this but then I realized this part is not doing any parsing of the content, this is to get the schema version to parse to the right version, for the deserialization we use Jackson who by default has this protection enabled [FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml#190](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/190) so even if we wanted to do this we would need to change the default behavior of Jackson

Disabling it is fine and desired IMO. An alternative would be to allow users to provide their own `DocumentBuilderFactory`, but defaulting to a locked-down version.

But that feels like something we can think about when there's an immediate need for it, i.e. when someone needs it.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Is it possible to change this to some URL or local file path that is *not* controlled by a 3rd party?

Disabling it is fine and desired IMO. An alternative would be to allow users to provide their own `DocumentBuilderFactory`, but defaulting to a locked-down version.

But that feels like something we can think about when there's an immediate need for it, i.e. when someone needs it.

| hey [@nscuro](https://github.com/nscuro) for some reason I can't reply to your last comment, I can do this in a new PR, I want to focus this on the fix, and then we can add the option to set their on `DocumentBuilderFactory` but to be honest I find it useless, this is not to parse the file, this is to get the schema version, the actual process is done with Jackson |

[@mr-zepol](https://github.com/mr-zepol) I wasn't saying we should implement that, I was merely pointing out we *could* do it, but **only** when people actually start asking for it, which I think will not happen. So all good.

What if an organization legitimately needs them especially for external references etc? Best to expose these as non-breaking settings and make it clear that users and applications are responsible for security and cannot offload security to core libraries.  I thought about this but then I realized this part is not doing any parsing of the content, this is to get the schema version to parse to the right version, for the deserialization we use Jackson who by default has this protection enabled [FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml#190](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/190) so even if we wanted to do this we would need to change the default behavior of Jackson        Sorry, something went wrong.

An alternative would be to allow users to provide their own `DocumentBuilderFactory`, but defaulting to a locked-down version.  But that feels like something we can think about when there's an immediate need for it, i.e. when someone needs it.
