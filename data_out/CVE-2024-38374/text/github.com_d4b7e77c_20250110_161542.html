# Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-core-java

High

[jkowalleck](/jkowalleck)
published
GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8
Jun 24, 2024

## Package

maven

org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-core-java
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 2.1.0, < 9.0.4

## Patched versions

9.0.4

## Description

### Impact

Before deserializing CycloneDX Bill of Materials in XML format, *cyclonedx-core-java* leverages XPath expressions to determine the schema version of the BOM. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

XXE injection can be exploited to exfiltrate local file content, or perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to access infrastructure adjacent to the vulnerable application.

### PoC

```
import org.cyclonedx.parsers.XmlParser;

class Poc {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Will throw org.cyclonedx.exception.ParseException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
        new XmlParser().parse("""
            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
            <!DOCTYPE bom [<!ENTITY % sp SYSTEM "https://localhost:1010/does-not-exist/file.dtd"> %sp;]>
            <bom xmlns="http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom/1.5"/>
            """.getBytes());
    }

}
```
### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in *cyclonedx-core-java* version 0.9.4.

### Workarounds

If feasible, applications can reject XML documents before handing them to *cyclonedx-core-java* for parsing.

This may be an option if incoming CycloneDX BOMs are known to be in JSON format.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
