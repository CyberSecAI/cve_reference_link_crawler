What if an organization legitimately needs them especially for external references etc? Best to expose these as non-breaking settings and make it clear that users and applications are responsible for security and cannot offload security to core libraries.  I thought about this but then I realized this part is not doing any parsing of the content, this is to get the schema version to parse to the right version, for the deserialization we use Jackson who by default has this protection enabled [FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml#190](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/190) so even if we wanted to do this we would need to change the default behavior of Jackson        Sorry, something went wrong.

An alternative would be to allow users to provide their own `DocumentBuilderFactory`, but defaulting to a locked-down version.
