{
  "CVE-2017-9856": {
    "Root cause": "Passwords transmitted over SMAdata2+ communication are encrypted using a very simple and reversible encryption algorithm.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Weak encryption algorithm"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can decrypt sniffed passwords and use them to authenticate to the device, potentially escalating privileges and disclosing information.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to sniff SMAdata2+ communication to capture the encrypted passwords. The attacker can then decrypt them.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the SMA inverters and the ability to sniff network traffic. They need to be able to reverse the simple encryption algorithm used."
