Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-29526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `syscall.Faccessat` function within the Go programming language's standard library. Specifically, the function incorrectly checks group permissions when determining if a process has access to a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `syscall.Faccessat` function was using the process's group ID instead of the file's group ID when evaluating group permissions, leading to incorrect access control checks.
- This means that if a process user belonged to the *process's* group, the check would evaluate the *file's* group permissions, regardless of whether the process's user was actually a member of the file's group.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- This vulnerability could allow a process to potentially gain access to a file that it should not have been able to access, if the process's group matches the files group.
- It is essentially an incorrect privilege check which could lead to privilege escalation if an application depends on the function being correctly implemented.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a local process calling the `syscall.Faccessat` function with a non-zero flag parameter on a Linux system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to execute code as a user on a Linux system using a Go program which calls `syscall.Faccessat`.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the non-zero flag parameter.
- They also need to manipulate file permissions.
- The attacker does not require user interaction or special privileges.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects Linux systems using the internal implementation of `Faccessat`, which is for kernels <5.8. Linux kernels >= 5.8 use the `faccessat2` syscall instead and are not vulnerable in this way.
- The issue was reported by Joël Gähwiler (@256dpi).
- The vulnerability was fixed in Go versions 1.18.2 and 1.17.10.
- Patches were also backported to older versions of Go and some other programs.

- NetApp identified that the BeeGFS CSI driver was affected, but there are no plans to address the vulnerability.
- Fedora rebuilt several packages to address this vulnerability.
