We have just released Go versions 1.18.2 and 1.17.10, minor point releases.

These minor releases include one security fix following the security policy:

  • syscall: fix Faccessat on Linux

> When called with a non-zero flags parameter, the Faccessat function could incorrectly report that a file is accessible.

> Thanks to Joël Gähwiler (@256dpi) for reporting this.

> This is CVE-2022-29526 and <https://go.dev/issue/52313>.

View the release notes for more information:
    <https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.18.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:
    <https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
"git checkout go1.18.2" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
Heschi and David for the Go team
