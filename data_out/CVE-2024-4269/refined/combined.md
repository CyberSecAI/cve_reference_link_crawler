## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SVG Block < 1.1.20 - Author+ Stored XSS via SVG File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize SVG file contents, which enables users with at least the author role to SVG with malicious JavaScript to conduct Stored XSS attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a SVG file with the malicious payload within it; Example SVG file: https://github.com/codesecure-org/xss-svg/blob/main/1.svg?short\_path=97b023c
2. As a user with the Author role, go to the "Media" page and upload the SVG file
3. Access the uploaded file directly
4. You will see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
