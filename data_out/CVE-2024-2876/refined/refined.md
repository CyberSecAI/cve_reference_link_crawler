Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2876:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation within the `run` function of the `IG_ES_Subscribers_Query` class. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied parameters are not correctly escaped or parameterized before being used in a SQL query.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** User-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query, specifically within the `get_condition` function.
    *   **Insufficient Query Preparation:** The SQL queries constructed are not prepared, allowing injection of malicious SQL code.
*  **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to inject SQL queries, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive database information.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Full Compromise:** In severe cases, the vulnerability could allow for complete compromise of the database or server by using the injection to perform other harmful actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   **Direct SQL Injection:** By manipulating parameters passed to the vulnerable `run` function of `IG_ES_Subscribers_Query`, attackers can inject SQL code into the query.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress site.
    *   **Knowledge of Plugin:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable plugin and the vulnerable entry points (`IG_ES_Subscribers_Query` class and the `run` function).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `run` method of the `class-ig-es-subscriber-query.php` file.
*   The vulnerable code is located around line 304 within the `get_condition` method, where insufficient escaping of user-supplied data occurs, and parameters in SQL query are not correctly prepared.
*   The fix is to properly sanitize user-supplied parameters, and prepare the SQL queries before execution.

**Affected Software:**

*   The vulnerability affects the "Email Subscribers by Icegram Express" WordPress plugin.
*   Specifically, all versions up to and including version 5.7.14 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade the plugin to version 5.7.15 or a newer patched version.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article indicates this is a critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Arkadiusz Hydzik.
*   The identified vulnerable code snippet is within the `get_condition` function of the `class-ig-es-subscriber-query.php` file.
