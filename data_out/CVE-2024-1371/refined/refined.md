### Summary
The provided content details a vulnerability in the LeadConnector WordPress plugin, specifically a missing authorization check in the `lc_public_api_proxy()` function that allows unauthenticated users to delete arbitrary posts.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `lc_public_api_proxy` function within the `class-lc-admin.php` file lacking a proper capability check. This allows any unauthenticated user to access this function and execute actions intended only for authorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the absence of a check to verify if the user making a request to `lc_public_api_proxy` has the necessary permissions. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.
- **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** Specifically, the lack of authorization allows unauthenticated users to call the `wp_delete_post` function which can lead to deletion of arbitrary posts on the site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Unauthenticated attackers can delete posts from the WordPress site which could lead to significant data loss and affect website functionality.
- **Integrity Issues:** The unauthorized modification of site content can lead to integrity issues and may require considerable effort to restore the website to its original state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack can be carried out remotely through network access, as it exploits a public API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** Attackers do not need any authentication or user accounts on the WordPress site to carry out this attack.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the LeadConnector plugin up to and including version 1.7.
- The patch was introduced in version 1.8 where the function was modified to include a permission check with `current_user_can( 'manage_options' )` .
- CVE-2024-34378 has been noted as a likely duplicate of this issue.
- The vulnerable code can be found in the `class-lc-admin.php` file, specifically the `lc_public_api_proxy` function
