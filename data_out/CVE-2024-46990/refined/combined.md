# SSRF Loopback IP filter bypass

Moderate

[br41nslug](/br41nslug)
published
GHSA-68g8-c275-xf2m
Sep 18, 2024

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 10.13.2

## Patched versions

10.13.3, 11.1.0

## Description

### Impact

If you're relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter this can be bypassed using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`)

### Workaround

You can block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`.

### Severity

Moderate

5.0

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-46990
