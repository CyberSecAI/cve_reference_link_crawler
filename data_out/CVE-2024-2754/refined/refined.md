The provided content relates to CVE-2024-2754.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to unrestricted file upload in the `admin/users_photo.php` file of the Complete E-Commerce Site in PHP/MySQLi V1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Unrestricted file upload: The application allows users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation or sanitization, leading to the ability to upload malicious code.
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading a file containing malicious code (e.g., a PHP shell), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Remote code execution: An attacker can gain complete control of the server, allowing for data theft, modification, or further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   HTTP POST request: A malicious file is uploaded via a POST request to `admin/users_photo.php` with the filename parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attacker must have a valid user account. User registration is open by default in the application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
