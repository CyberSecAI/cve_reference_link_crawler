# rxvt-unicode: Arbitrary Code Execution — GLSA **202310-20**

A vulnerability has been discovered in rxvt-unicode where data written to the terminal can lead to code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-terms/rxvt-unicode** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.30** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.30** |

### Background

rxvt-unicode is a clone of the well known terminal emulator rxvt.

### Description

A vulnerability has been discovered in rxvt-unicode. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

in the Perl background extension, when an attacker can
control the data written to the user's terminal and certain options are set.
The "background" extension is automatically loaded if certain X resources are set such as 'transparent' (see the full list at the top of src/perl/background[1]). So it is possible to be using this extension without realising it.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All rxvt-unicode users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-9.30"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2151597#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2022-12-07 15:22:08 UTC  ``` rxvt-unicode 9.25 and 9.26 are vulnerable to remote code execution, in the Perl background extension, when an attacker can control the data written to the user's terminal and certain options are set.  The "background" extension is automatically loaded if certain X resources are set such as 'transparent' (see the full list at the top of src/perl/background). So it is possible to be using this extension without realizing it.  This is accidentally fixed on version 9.30, and 9.29, it appears to not be exploitable, but only due to another bug (not a security bug). The actual bug which makes this not vulnerable on 9.30 is simply a wrong number in "on_osc_seq".   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2151597#c1)  Borja Tarraso    2022-12-07 15:26:30 UTC  ``` Created rxvt-unicode tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 2151598](show_bug.cgi?id=2151598 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-4170 rxvt-unicode: remote code execution via background OSC [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2151599](show_bug.cgi?id=2151599 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-4170 rxvt-unicode: remote code execution via background OSC [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2151597#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-12-09 20:33:00 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2151597#c3)  Robbie Harwood    2022-12-16 18:42:00 UTC  ``` > Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2151599](show_bug.cgi?id=2151599 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-4170 rxvt-unicode: remote code execution via background OSC [fedora-all]")]  Current fedora versions: fc38: rxvt-unicode-9.30-4.fc37 fc37: rxvt-unicode-9.30-4.fc37 fc36: rxvt-unicode-9.30-2.fc36  > This is accidentally fixed on version 9.30, and 9.29, it appears to not be exploitable, but only due to another bug (not a security bug).  Given this, I really don't see what action you expect me to take with that bug.   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE-2022-4170: rxvt-unicode code execution via background OSC

I've discovered rxvt-unicode 9.25 and 9.26 are vulnerable to remote
code execution, in the Perl background extension, when an attacker can
control the data written to the user's terminal and certain options
are set.

The "background" extension is automatically loaded if certain X
resources are set such as 'transparent' (see the full list at the top
of src/perl/background[1]). So it is possible to be using this
extension without realising it.

This is accidentally fixed on version 9.30, and I haven't confirmed
9.29, it appears to not be exploitable, but only due to another (not
security) bug. The actual bug which makes this not vulnerable on 9.30
is simply a wrong number in "on_osc_seq".

For 9.25 and 9.26 the patch at[2] can be backported. The body of the fix is:

 sub q0 {
-   (my $str = shift) =~ s/\x00//g; # make sure there really aren't
any embedded NULs
-   "q\x00$str\x00"
+   "qq\x00\Q$_[0]\E\x00"
 }

Isn't Perl quoting fun? Paranoid people may wish to remove the entire
"on_osc_seq" subroutine to avoid passing any potentially untrusted
input anywhere near eval (this feature is deprecated and the
maintainer did mention they are considering what to do longer term).

It doesn't make sense to withhold an exploit for this; the fix gives a
pretty good idea where to look and this isn't vulnerable in the latest
version.

$ urxvt -transparent

Inside that running terminal:

# Make tint be "\\", which means the ending \x00 is quoted under our control
$ printf '\e]705;\\\a'
# Make the second q0 end the quoted q-string and then be valid perl
under our control
$ printf '\e]20;,rootalign root),`touch /tmp/cve-2022-4170` #\a'

This has been assigned CVE-2022-4170.
