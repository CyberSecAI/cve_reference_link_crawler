| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2151597#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2022-12-07 15:22:08 UTC  ``` rxvt-unicode 9.25 and 9.26 are vulnerable to remote code execution, in the Perl background extension, when an attacker can control the data written to the user's terminal and certain options are set.  The "background" extension is automatically loaded if certain X resources are set such as 'transparent' (see the full list at the top of src/perl/background). So it is possible to be using this extension without realizing it.  This is accidentally fixed on version 9.30, and 9.29, it appears to not be exploitable, but only due to another bug (not a security bug). The actual bug which makes this not vulnerable on 9.30 is simply a wrong number in "on_osc_seq".   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2151597#c1)  Borja Tarraso    2022-12-07 15:26:30 UTC  ``` Created rxvt-unicode tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 2151598](show_bug.cgi?id=2151598 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-4170 rxvt-unicode: remote code execution via background OSC [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2151599](show_bug.cgi?id=2151599 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-4170 rxvt-unicode: remote code execution via background OSC [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2151597#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-12-09 20:33:00 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.
