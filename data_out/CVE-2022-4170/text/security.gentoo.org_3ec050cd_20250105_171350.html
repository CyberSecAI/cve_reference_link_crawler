# rxvt-unicode: Arbitrary Code Execution — GLSA **202310-20**

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-terms/rxvt-unicode** on all architectures |

### Background

rxvt-unicode is a clone of the well known terminal emulator rxvt.

### Description

A vulnerability has been discovered in rxvt-unicode. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-9.30"
