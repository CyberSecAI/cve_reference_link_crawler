Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetRemoteWebManage` function of Tenda W20EV4.0 V15.11.0.6 firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The `remoteIP` parameter from a POST request is copied to a local buffer using `strcpy` without proper bounds checking.
- The size of the `ip` variable/buffer receiving the `remoteIP` parameter is insufficient to handle larger inputs, which allows for a stack buffer overflow when the `remoteIP` parameter is larger.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the target device. The attacker could overwrite the return address on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetRemoteWebManage` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device's web interface. Typically this would be on the same network as the device or potentially through a publicly accessible interface.
- The attacker has to know the URL `/goform/SetRemoteWebManage` and the parameter `remoteIP` that needs to be overflowed.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a POST request with a `remoteIP` parameter of 2000 'a' characters, which is enough to overflow the buffer.
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda W20EV4.0 V15.11.0.6.
- The `strcpy` is the vulnerable function used.
