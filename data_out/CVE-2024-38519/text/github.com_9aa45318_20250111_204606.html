### @dirkf **[dirkf](/dirkf)** commented [Jul 2, 2024](#issue-2386398509)

Boilerplate: yt-dlp/own code, fix
## Please follow the guide below

* You will be asked some questions, please read them **carefully** and answer honestly
* Put an `x` into all the boxes [ ] relevant to your *pull request* (like that [x])
* Use *Preview* tab to see how your *pull request* will actually look like

---

### Before submitting a *pull request* make sure you have:

* [Searched](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/search?q=is%3Apr&type=Issues) the bugtracker for similar pull requests
* Read [adding new extractor tutorial](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#adding-support-for-a-new-site)
* Read [youtube-dl coding conventions](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#youtube-dl-coding-conventions) and adjusted the code to meet them
* Covered the code with tests (note that PRs without tests will be REJECTED)
* Checked the code with [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8)

### In order to be accepted and merged into youtube-dl each piece of code must be in public domain or released under [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/). Check one of the following options:

* I am the original author of this code and I am willing to release it under [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/), except for code from yt-dlp for which this or the below has already been asserted

### What is the purpose of your *pull request*?

* Bug fix
* Improvement
* New extractor
* New feature

---

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This PR adds validation of file extensions processed by yt-dl

1. against a white-list of expected extensions (unpublicised `--no-check-extensions` disables this, CLI only)
2. to exclude path separators in a site-supplied extension that could enable path traversal under vulnerable OSes (Windows, eg).

The PR is derived from <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-ghsa-79w7-vh3h-8g4j/pull/1>.

Thanks:

* [@Grub4K](https://github.com/Grub4K) for the PR
* [@pukkandan](https://github.com/pukkandan) for the original report
* [@JarLob](https://github.com/JarLob) for a further report and for additional testing.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@dirkf](https://github.com/dirkf) saving a video file without an extension is a practice which may be used for having a format-agnostic filename. this change breaks multiple scripts with this behavior. please consider reverting the behavior to allow no extension |

### **[dirkf](/dirkf)** commented [Jul 5, 2024](#issuecomment-2211369081)

| Please open a support issue showing an example with verbose log and explaining what you think should happen instead.  Possible work-arounds for CLI:   * use `--exec ...` to rename away an unwanted extension * use `--no-check-extensions`   For API, try similar approaches to that in [e15101c](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/commit/e15101cb9970aa683d8e7e3e3f492869e4844e5b) (`__init__.py`) or the equivalent in *yt-dlp* (`_UnsafeExtensionError.sanitize_extension = lambda x, **kw: x`). |
