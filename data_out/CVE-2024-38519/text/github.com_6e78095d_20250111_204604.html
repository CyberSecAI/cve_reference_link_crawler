# File system modification and RCE through improper file-extension sanitization

High

[bashonly](/bashonly)
published
GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j
Jul 1, 2024

## Package

pip

yt-dlp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2024.07.01

## Patched versions

2024.07.01

## Description

### Summary

`yt-dlp` does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` also reads config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the yt-dlp directory) this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.

### Patches

`yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions.

This means some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded; however, it will also limit the possible exploitation surface.

### Workarounds

It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.07.01 as soon as possible, **always** have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template, and make sure you trust the websites that you are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like your user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations.

For users not able to upgrade:

* Make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one
* Try to avoid the generic extractor (`--ies default,-generic`)
* Keep the default output template (`-o "%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`)
* Omit any of the subtitle options (`--write-subs`, `--write-auto-subs`, `--all-subs`, `--write-srt`)
* Use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations

### Details

One potential exploitation might look like this:

From a mimetype we do not know, we default to trimming the leading bit and using the remainder. Given a webpage that contains

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "VideoObject",
    "name": "ffmpeg",
    "encodingFormat": "video/exe",
    "contentUrl": "https://example.com/video.mp4"
}
</script>
```

this will try and download a file called `ffmpeg.exe` (`-o "%(title)s.%(ext)s`).

`ffmpeg.exe` will be searched for in the current directory, and so upon the next run arbitrary code can be executed.

Alternatively, when engineering a file called `yt-dlp.conf` to be created, the config file could contain `--exec ...` and so would also execute arbitrary code.

A big thanks to [@JarLob](https://github.com/JarLob) for independently finding a new application of the same underlying issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
