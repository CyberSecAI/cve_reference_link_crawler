A threat modeling workshop took us to a remote location where there was a new hotel. It was so small that there was no check-in staff, but a check-in terminal for self-service. What was bound to happen, happened.

The hotel check-in terminal is running an Ariane Allegro Scenario Player in a kiosk mode and the application crashed when entering a single quote character into the guest search. The application crash allowed access to the underlying Windows Desktop. According to Ariane, an outdated software version was installed in the new hotel.

According to the vendor Ariane Systems, "Ariane is the world leader in providing self-check-in and out solutions for the hotel industry. [...] Ariane currently serves 3,000 hotels and 500,000 rooms in more than 25 countries. This includes one-third of the top 100 global hotel chains."

## Timeline

* 2024-03-05: Vulnerability was discovered at a check-in terminal.
* 2024-03-06: Preliminary advisory written.
* 2024-03-06: Information sent to the hotel brand that uses the check-in terminal and asked about used application versions.
* 2024-03-07: Tried to find information how a vulnerability can be reported to Ariane Systems. The vendor does not use security.txt nor a DNS TXT record for security contact lookup. There is no information on the website how to contact the product security team. Therefore, Pentagrid initially contacted Ariane Systems via support@ariane.com.
* 2024-03-14: Sent another request to the Ariane Systems support, after not receiving any feedback.
* 2024-03-14: Sent a status information to the affected hotel.
* 2024-03-14: Contacted Ariane Systems' technical leader and chief product officer via Linkedin. Chief product officer responded and recommended to contact dataprivacy@ariane.com.
* 2024-03-14: Sent e-mail to dataprivacy@ariane.com.
* 2024-03-14: Verified all e-mails of previous communication attempts were received by Ariane Systems' mail server by reviewing Pentagrid's mail server logs.
* 2024-03-15: Tried to get an e-mail receipt confirmation from the chief product officer via Linkedin, after not receiving any feedback.
* 2024-03-18: Tried to contact chief product officer via e-mail by guessing the e-mail address, after not receiveing any response, but e-mail address guessing failed.
* 2024-03-18: Contacted chief product officer via Linkedin again, to get a confirmation that Pentagrid's e-mail for starting the coordinated disclosure process has been received.
* 2024-03-18: Contacted Ariane Systems publicly via Linkedin.
* 2024-03-18: Sent vulnerability details to dataprivacy@ariane.com, after getting a first contact confirmation via e-mail.
* 2024-03-18: Received first response, which stated that the systems are legacy systems, that USB ports are disabled and "no PII or exploitable data can be retrieved from the kiosk".
* 2024-03-25: Disputing Ariane Systems' claim that no PII data can be retrieved, because as part of the system design the kiosk produces and keeps accessible invoice files.
* 2024-04-11: Call with Ariane Systems.
* 2024-05-31: Asked Ariane for a status, but there was no response.
* 2024-06-05: Publication after 90 days.
* 2024-06-06: CVE-2024-37364 was assigned.
## Kiosk mode bypass

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, 6.8 Medium
```
### Affected Components

The check-in terminal is likely a terminal of type Ariane Duo 6000 series, which runs the Ariane Allegro Scenario Player.

A hotel brand from Liechtenstein and Switzerland uses the check-in terminal for smaller hotel locations. The check-in terminal supports room booking as well as checking into the hotel. It initiates the payment process via a POS terminal, provisions RFID transponders to open the booked hotel room and it prints an invoice.

### Summary

The check-in terminal allows searching for existing room reservations. Reservations can be looked up by booking code or by surname. When searching a reservation by name and the entered name contains a single-quote, the application hangs. When touching the screen of the terminal again, the Windows operating system will ask the user if Windows should wait any longer or stop the task. Selecting stop ends the kiosk mode application.

### Impact

When stopping the application, the kiosk mode is stopped and the user gets access to a Windows desktop.

With access to the Windows desktop, attacks on the hotel network could become possible as well as access to data stored on the terminal, which includes PII, reservations and invoices. With the ability to inject and execute program code, it seems possible to get room keys created for other rooms, because the functionality of provisioning RFID transponders is implemented in the terminal.

### Technical Details

When a user searches an existing reservation and adds a single-quote to the surname, the application hangs. An example input that causes the effect is "O'YOLO".

[![Entering a name into the search field with a single-quote character. In this example, "O'YOLO" is entered. The hotel's brand logo is masked in the photo.](../../../images/202406_ariane_hotel_terminal_enter_name.thumbnail.jpg)](../../../images/202406_ariane_hotel_terminal_enter_name.jpg)

The application hangs. By touching the Elo display again, Windows will ask how to proceed with the application.

[![Windows asks whether the application should be continued or stopped.](../../../images/202406_ariane_hotel_terminal_stop_kiosk_application.thumbnail.jpg)](../../../images/202406_ariane_hotel_terminal_stop_kiosk_application.jpg)

When stopping the application, the Windows desktop becomes accessible.

### Precondition

An attacker needs physical access to a check-in terminal and depending on the attack preparation some time at the terminal. The terminal must be in a state where it allows self-service, for example as Hotels might only enable it during specific times.

### Recommendation

According to Ariane, the problem was fixed in the Allegro Scenario Player. Therefore, Pentagrid recommends hotels using the terminal:

* To ensure that a recent version of the software is installed. The version that fixes the issue is not known to Pentagrid. Hence Ariane Systems should be asked.
* To isolate check-in terminals so that bypassing the kiosk mode does not allow attacks on the hotel network or the Windows domain.
### Credits

This vulnerability was accidentally found by Martin "O'YOLO" Schobert (Pentagrid).

I was expecting some kind of SQL injection, which you could at least understand as a result of incompetence. Or I can similarly understand UTF-8 bugs or whatever.

I don't know if I'm more mystified by the fact that this made it past testing, or that rather than the reservation lookup just returning no matches it actually *crashes*. I'm really trying to imagine what possible code could be crashing. I guess my best guess is an off-by-one error in a function trying to escape strings for use in a SQL query, that leads to inserting infinite quotes and running out of memory.

Therefore, Pentagrid initially contacted Ariane Systems via support@ariane.com.* Ugh. I've been in a similar scenario and had to report a security bug via the normal support channel for a fairly large-sized company. Never again. It was significantly more work to get the bug in front of someone who understood it and could do something about it than it was developing the exploit in the first place. After a certain company size it should be a legal requirement to have a dedicated security contact listed somewhere. Now, after a few good faith attempts to get an exploit in front of the appropriate person at a company, I just forget it. I'm sure there are people in similar situations who, after a few attempts to report to the company, end up selling the exploit rather than forgetting it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fragmede](user?id=fragmede) [7 months ago](item?id=40606042)   | [parent](#40601633) | [next](#40602230) [–]  Hard to forget when it'll result in your PII (if you're a customer of theirs) getting leaked, and you'll get, what, a few months of credit report monitoring? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [RIMR](user?id=RIMR) [7 months ago](item?id=40602230)   | [prev](#40601633) | [next](#40601512) [–]  This is pretty hilarious, because I am familiar with these systems, and the correct way to bypass the kiosk mode application is to open the little drawer at the bottom of the self check-in station, and hit Alt+F4 on the little keyboard.

There are always ways to crash or minimize the kioks app. Then you are on the loose. With Linux and X, it is possible to run X server with a specific app inside. You crash the app, it restarts together with X server. Of course, in Windows you can specify a different app other than Explorer.exe as "shell" and get a single app session! It just doesn't get used because: Unfortunately, these systems seem to always been developed by especially clueless people who only ever have seen hammers in their lives and therefore everything looks like nails. Having said that, the quality of embedded programming always looks subpar. It's like these people see themselves as hardware makers and therefore think they can avoid learning software making 101. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [HeWhoLurksLate](user?id=HeWhoLurksLate) [7 months ago](item?id=40603372)   | [parent](#40601512) | [next](#40604921) [–]  It is amusing to me in a comment about a particular group only seeing hammers and nails that the presented solution focuses specifically on a singular technology / implementation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kayodelycaon](user?id=kayodelycaon) [7 months ago](item?id=40604921)   | [parent](#40601512) | [prev](#40603372) | [next](#40603346) [–]  iPads are equally great.

It seems like most of the time if I can press Ctrl+function key, it'll almost always drop out of the kiosk app at at least give me a login prompt. Sometimes it'll bother asking for a password, sometimes not. I've also encountered Linux kiosks where the app crashed and it is just sitting at a busybox terminal with root access as well. If you even slightly know how Windows IoT or Embedded works, setting up a Windows kiosk is pretty dang simple. There's simple wizards baked into Embedded/IoT that walk you through it. > Desktop Windows isn't made for kiosk applications at all Fully agreed here.

However sometimes if you plug in a keyboard and hit ctrl-alt-del you get task manager and can run additional programs. I can imagine the Allegro app uses a virtual keyboard of some type for this user entry, and it goes south from there. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jeroenhd](user?id=jeroenhd) [7 months ago](item?id=40605307)   | [root](#40599949) | [parent](#40602173) | [next](#40604701) [–]  The screenshot suggests they use Windows 7 (could be one of the IoT versions that recently still received updates, but I doubt it). I don't think 7 had the system features listed in the kiosk mode documentation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vel0city](user?id=vel0city) [7 months ago](item?id=40608785)   | [root](#40599949) | [parent](#40605307) | [next](#40604701) [–]  Exactly this. They should be using a very stripped-down Windows IoT build in kiosk mode. Even for this outdated (and insecure) generation it looks like they're not actually using the Embedded version of Windows. While I don't think that had a named "kiosk mode", there were lots of things one could have done to make it not just crash to a regular full-featured desktop. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [userbinator](user?id=userbinator) [7 months ago](item?id=40604701)   | [parent](#40599949) | [prev](#40600993) | [next](#40600049) [–]  If they developed their application on Linux, you might see a Linux desktop instead. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bennyp101](user?id=bennyp101) [7 months ago](item?id=40609302)   | [root](#40599949) | [parent](#40604701) | [next](#40600049) [–]  Not the year for it | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SpaceL10n](user?id=SpaceL10n) [7 months ago](item?id=40600049)   | [parent](#40599949) | [prev](#40604701) | [next](#40600269) [–]  It's shocking just how many kiosk manufacturers expose the underlying OS.

With that setup there's nowhere to break out. And if it crashes to the console - no way out either with no physical keyboard present. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fy20](user?id=fy20) [7 months ago](item?id=40604313)   | [root](#40599949) | [parent](#40600207) | [next](#40600491) [–]  At my 9-5 we make kiosks based on a custom Linux system. Everything is run within Docker containers, so even if you somehow kill the UI it'll just restart the container. VT on the host OS are disabled. I can see why most companies prefer Windows though for these type of devices. Driver issues with graphics and third party hardware are a constant pain point for us. Unless you control the whole ecosystem and write your own drivers (e.g. smart TVs), Linux based systems are tricky. I'd imagine Windows has the same issue to some extend, but it's the default target for manufacturers, so their Windows drivers are usually better. I feel there could be a market for a custom Linux OS aimed for these use cases. Windows licensing is not cheap when you have tens of thousands of devices, and they aren't running the 'Home' version. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [withinboredom](user?id=withinboredom) [7 months ago](item?id=40606520)   | [root](#40599949) | [parent](#40604313) | [next](#40600491) [–]  Isn't the iot version of windows free? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [DaSHacka](user?id=DaSHacka) [7 months ago](item?id=40610545)   | [root](#40599949) | [parent](#40606520) | [next](#40600491) [–]  IoT as in LTSC IoT?
