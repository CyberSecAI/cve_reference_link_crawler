Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-24883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the server-side authentication process of FreeRDP when using a Security Account Manager (SAM) file. Specifically, if the server is configured with an invalid SAM file path, the authentication might succeed even with invalid credentials. This is due to an issue in how the `ntlm_fetch_ntlm_v2_hash` function handles lookups in the SAM database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the configured path to the SAM database. It proceeds with the authentication process even if the specified path is invalid, leading to an authentication bypass.
- **Flawed Logic:** The logic in `ntlm_fetch_ntlm_v2_hash` appears to have an issue where it may still return a successful result even if the user lookup in the SAM database fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the RDP server by bypassing authentication using invalid credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation would grant the attacker access to the resources and data available on the RDP server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via the RDP protocol.
- **Server Misconfiguration:** The vulnerability is triggered by a misconfiguration on the RDP server where an invalid SAM database path is set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable RDP server over the network.
- **RDP Client:** An RDP client is required to interact with the server.
- **Knowledge of Misconfiguration:** The attacker does not need to know valid usernames and passwords but needs to target a server that has an invalid path to the SAM database configured.

**Additional Notes:**
- FreeRDP-based clients are not directly affected. This vulnerability is on the server side, specifically for RDP server implementations that use FreeRDP for SAM file authentication.
- A fix for this issue was released in FreeRDP version 2.7.0.
- Workarounds include using custom authentication via `HashCallback` or ensuring the SAM database path is valid.
- The provided code diff shows changes to the `ntlm_fetch_ntlm_v2_hash` function in `winpr/libwinpr/sspi/NTLM/ntlm_compute.c`, which was part of the fix for this vulnerability
