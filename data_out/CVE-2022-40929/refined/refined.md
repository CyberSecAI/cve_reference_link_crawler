{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to create and execute custom scripts within the task management system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection: The system allows users to define shell scripts that are then executed by the server. If these scripts are not properly sanitized, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the task management interface, where an attacker can create or modify a task to include malicious shell commands. The provided example uses netcat to establish a reverse shell.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to create or edit tasks. They also need to know the IP address and port number on which to set up the listener for the reverse shell."
