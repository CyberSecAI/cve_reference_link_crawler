Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the insertion of sensitive information into log files by some Intel On Demand software.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  The primary weakness is the logging of sensitive information. This means that the software, during normal operation or specific actions, is inadvertently writing sensitive data to log files.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  Successful exploitation leads to information disclosure. An attacker who gains access to these log files could potentially access the exposed sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access to the system where the affected Intel On Demand software is installed. An attacker needs to have local access to the log files on the system
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system, meaning they would need to have already compromised the system or have valid credentials for a local account.

**Summary of Vulnerability Details**

The vulnerability stems from the logging of sensitive information to log files by Intel On Demand agent software. Specifically, prior to versions 1.16.2, 2.1.1, and 3.1.0, the software would store sensitive details within these logs. An authenticated user with local system access can then read these logs, leading to potential information disclosure. The CVSS score is 5.5 (Medium), with the vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, highlighting the local attack vector, low attack complexity, low privilege requirement, no user interaction, and high confidentiality impact.
