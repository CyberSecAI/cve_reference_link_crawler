Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4161

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the cleartext transmission of sensitive information by the affected Moxa MGate protocol gateways. Specifically, login credentials transmitted over HTTP are not encrypted, making them vulnerable to interception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):** The device transmits login credentials without encryption over HTTP, which is the primary vulnerability.
- Vulnerable firmware versions in the Moxa MGate MB3000 series protocol gateways.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can intercept network traffic, specifically HTTP communications, to obtain login credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successfully acquired credentials allow attackers to gain administrative privileges on the device via the HTTP web server.
- **Potential for wider network compromise:** Once the attacker has control over the device, the attacker could use this as a beachhead to move laterally on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** Attackers can passively monitor network traffic to intercept unencrypted credentials.
- **Remote Exploitation:** Vulnerable devices can be exploited remotely if accessible over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be positioned on the network such that they can sniff traffic to/from the vulnerable device.
- **Low Skill Requirement:** The attack requires low skill as the credentials are transmitted in cleartext, making it simple to intercept and use.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability affects specific firmware versions of Moxa MGate MB3180, MB3280, and MB3480 Series Protocol Gateways.
-   The CVSS v3 score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
-   Mitigations involve enabling HTTPS and disabling the HTTP console, as well as network security best practices.
