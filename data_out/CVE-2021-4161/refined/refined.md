- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected Moxa MGate devices transmit login credentials in cleartext over HTTP, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). Specifically, the login credentials for the device's HTTP web server are sent without encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to sniff network traffic, decrypt login credentials, and gain administrative access to the device through its HTTP web server. This could lead to full control of the device and potentially impact connected industrial control systems.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network if the HTTP web server is accessible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic, which could be achieved via a man-in-the-middle attack, or by having access to the local network. No special access privileges are required, and the attacker does not require any user interaction.
