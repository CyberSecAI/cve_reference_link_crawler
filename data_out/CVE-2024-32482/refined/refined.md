Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability:** The core issue is a TOCTOU bug where the size of the message to be signed is checked at one point but used at another without proper synchronization. Specifically, the message size is updated after an initial check, leading to inconsistencies in the internal state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use):** The vulnerability is a classic TOCTOU issue.
*   **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read):** The TOCTOU condition allows for reading beyond the intended buffer boundaries in RAM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **RAM Disclosure:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to read portions of the TKey's RAM over the USB interface.
*   **Potential for Sensitive Data Leakage:** While the exploit is limited, a skilled attacker could potentially read sensitive assets if the vulnerable code is compiled with non-standard toolchains.
*   **No Full Private Key Leakage:** The location of the signing context on the stack prevents the attacker from completely leaking the private key and creating valid signatures over known messages. The exploit stops when the signing context is included in the read.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Custom Client Application:** Exploitation requires a custom client application that interacts with the TKey.
*   **USB Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the USB interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the TKey to connect with it through USB.
*   **Custom Client:** The attacker needs to develop or have access to a custom client application capable of sending specific commands.
*   **Skilled Attacker:** A skilled attacker may be able to extract more data from a device using custom-built software, especially if the software was not compiled by Tillitis or using their recommended build environment.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Message Size Manipulation:** The exploit works by repeatedly setting the message size for signing to values that exceed the buffer, exploiting the TOCTOU issue. The size is first set to the maximum (4096), and then to a size one byte larger (4097). The old size is used to send the data, while the new size is used by the signing function.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** By repeatedly increasing the size, the signing operation reads bytes past the initial message buffer, effectively leaking RAM content.
*   **Brute-Force:** To read the leaked byte, the attacker would have to try all 256 possibilities and try to verify if the resulting signature is correct.
*   **Memory Layout:** The locations of the message buffer, private key, and signing context are crucial. The message buffer grows towards higher addresses, allowing for out-of-bounds reads. The signing context's location on the stack helps to stop a full memory leak.
*   **Signing Operation:** The `hash_reduce` function is called twice, using the message as part of the hash. Since the signing context is located in the message, and the content of the context changes after the first call, it is impossible to produce valid signatures over a known message.

**Affected Applications:**

*   `tkey-device-signer` versions 0.0.7 and 0.0.8
*   `verisigner` versions 0.0.3 and earlier.
*   Client applications embedding these versions such as `tkey-ssh-agent`, `tkey-sign-cli` and `tkey-verification`

**Patches:**

*   `tkey-device-signer` version 1.0.0 addresses the issue.
*   Client applications were updated to use the patched version.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "low" severity because it does not lead to a complete disclosure of the private key and requires a specific set of conditions for exploitation.
*   Reproducible builds are important, the memory layout is dependent on the toolchain used for compilation. Using Tillitis's recommended OCI image for building is highly recommended.
*   A hardware fix was implemented in a later revision to prevent the wraparound in memory and continue to read from the start of the RAM.
