{
  "CVE-2024-42076": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel's J1939 implementation does not initialize unused data when creating a full CAN frame in the j1939_send_one() function. This leads to an information leak when the frame is received by a user-space application via raw_recvmsg().",
    "Root cause": "The `j1939_send_one()` function creates a full CAN frame including unused data, but does not initialize the unused portion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Uninitialized Data"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can potentially leak kernel memory by receiving a CAN frame that contains uninitialized kernel data. This is especially critical because sensitive information like cryptographic keys or other user information can be present in the kernel memory.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local Access",
      "CAN Socket interaction"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send a J1939 CAN message to trigger the vulnerable code path and be able to receive the frame with a raw CAN socket."
