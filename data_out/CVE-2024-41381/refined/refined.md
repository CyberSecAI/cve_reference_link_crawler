The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41381.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of user-provided input (`$_GET['group']`) which is then directly used within a `<module>` tag, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization or output encoding for the `$_GET['group']` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This allows the attacker to potentially:
  - Steal session cookies.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Modify the page content.
  - Perform other malicious actions within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload within the `group` parameter of the GET request.
  - vulnerable URL is `/admin/module/view?type=settings&group=[PAYLOAD]`
- This URL is then accessed by a victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and convince a victim to access it.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability, since the vulnerability lies in the `admin` endpoint that is accessible without prior authentication.
- Basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript is required for payload creation.
