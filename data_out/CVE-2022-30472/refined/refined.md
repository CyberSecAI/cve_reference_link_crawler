- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromAddressNat` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The function `sprintf` copies user-provided parameters (`entrys` and `mitInterface`) into a stack-based buffer `s` without any length checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by providing crafted overflow data.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a request to the `/goform/addressNat` page with a large `entrys` and `mitInterface` parameters is the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device and have knowledge of the vulnerable page and parameters to exploit the overflow.
