- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity when handling MIME attachments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of MIME attachments leads to a vulnerability related to insufficient verification of data authenticity, specifically CWE-345.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition by evading the AV engine.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating MIME attachments in a way that exploits the insufficient verification, an attacker can bypass the AV engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious MIME attachment. User interaction is required as the user needs to receive and process the email or data with the malicious attachment.
