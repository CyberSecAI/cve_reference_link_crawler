[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-3fvg-4v2m-98jf)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-3fvg-4v2m-98jf/dependabot)

## Package

npm

jsrsasign
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 4.8.0, < 10.5.25

## Patched versions

10.5.25

## Description

### Impact

Jsrsasign supports JWS(JSON Web Signatures) and JWT(JSON Web Token) validation. However JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake.

For example, even if a string of non Base64URL encoding characters such as `!@$%` or `\11` is inserted into a valid JWS or JWT signature value string, it will still be a valid JWS or JWT signature by mistake.

When jsrsasign's JWS or JWT validation is used in OpenID connect or OAuth2, this vulnerability will affect to authentication or authorization.

By our internal assessment, CVSS 3.1 score will be 8.6.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N

### Patches

Users validate JWS or JWT signatures should upgrade to 10.5.25.

### Workarounds

Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before

executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Thanks to Adi Malyanker and Or David for this vulnerability report. Also thanks for [Snyk security team](https://snyk.io/) for this coordination.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
