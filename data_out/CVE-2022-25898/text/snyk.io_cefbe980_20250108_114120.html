## How to fix?

Upgrade `jsrsasign` to version 10.5.25 or higher.

## Overview

[jsrsasign](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign) is a free pure JavaScript cryptographic library.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when `JWS` or `JWT` signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake.

## Workaround:

Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing `JWS.verify()` or `JWS.verifyJWT()` method.

## PoC:

```
var KJUR = require('jsrsasign');
var rsu = require('jsrsasign-util');

// jsrsasign@10.5.24

//// creating valid hs256 jwt - code used to get valid hs256 jwt.
// var oHeader = {alg: 'HS256', typ: 'JWT'};
// // Payload
// var oPayload = {};
// var tNow = KJUR.jws.IntDate.get('now');
// var tEnd = KJUR.jws.IntDate.get('now + 1year');
// oPayload.iss = "https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__foo.com&d=DwIGAg&c=wwDYKmuffy0jxUGHACmjfA&r=3J3pjDmBp7lIUZbkdHkHLg&m=CP36zULZ4

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.7 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
