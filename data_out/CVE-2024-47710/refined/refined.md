The provided content relates to CVE-2024-47710.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `sock_hash_free()` function in `net/core/sock_map.c` not yielding the CPU when destroying a map with a large number of buckets. This can lead to soft lockups, as reported by syzbot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of CPU yielding during the destruction of large sock maps.
- Potential for soft lockups during the `sock_hash_free()` operation, specifically when processing a large number of buckets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Soft lockups, potentially causing denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the destruction of a large sock map.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and destroy sock maps with a large number of buckets.
- This would likely require some form of privileged access or the ability to trigger this behavior through a suitable BPF program.
