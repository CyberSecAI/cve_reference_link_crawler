- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Spotify Play Button plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient sanitization of shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Contributor role or higher can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page/post by crafting a malicious shortcode, leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser when the page is visited.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted shortcode attributes. An attacker would embed malicious JavaScript within the attributes of the Spotify Play Button shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor level privileges to embed the malicious shortcode.
