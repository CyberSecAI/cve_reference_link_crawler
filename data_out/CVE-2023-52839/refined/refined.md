Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-52839.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an unnecessary broadcast to other CPUs when starting a performance counter in the `riscv_pmu_sbi.c` driver. This broadcast was introduced in a previous fix (commit 3fec323339a4) and is not required when starting a counter, but only when dealing with mmap where counters might have already been started on other CPUs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the incorrect usage of `on_each_cpu_mask` during counter startup. This function is designed to execute a function on each CPU matching a given mask, and it's not required when a counter is being started on a specific CPU. This triggers a warning in the kernel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The incorrect broadcast doesn't lead to a direct security vulnerability in the sense of code execution or data compromise. However, it results in a kernel warning (`WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 104 at kernel/smp.c:775 smp_call_function_many_cond+0x42c/0x436`) and introduces unnecessary overhead during counter start, which might impact performance.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered through the use of the `perf` tool when starting performance counters. Specifically, the provided command `perf record -e cycles:k -e instructions:k -c 10000 -m 64M dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null count=1000` demonstrates the issue, causing the kernel warning.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker does not require any special capabilities or position. They need to be able to execute the `perf` tool to start performance counters on a RISC-V system. The issue is present in the kernel code and can be triggered from user space via `perf`.
