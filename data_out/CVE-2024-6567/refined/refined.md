- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Ebook Store plugin utilizes `fpdi-protection` and fails to prevent direct access to test files that have `display_errors` set to true.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve the full path of the web application. This information, while not directly exploitable, can be used to aid other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: By directly accessing the vulnerable test files in the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated remote attacker.
