Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-22363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an inefficient regular expression used in the SheetJS library. This inefficient regex can lead to a "Regular Expression Denial of Service" (ReDoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity:** The core issue is the use of a regular expression that has a high computational complexity, which can be exploited by crafting specific input strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application using SheetJS to become unresponsive or crash by providing a specially crafted input, leading to an effective Denial of Service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network if the application using the vulnerable SheetJS library processes user-supplied data.
- **Input Manipulation:** The attack involves manipulating the input data (likely spreadsheet data) provided to the SheetJS library, specifically targeting the vulnerable regex.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** No authentication or special access is needed for exploitation. An attacker only needs to be able to provide input to the application that utilizes the vulnerable SheetJS library.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the affected application or service that utilizes the vulnerable SheetJS library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of SheetJS Community Edition up to and including version 0.20.1.
- The fix is available in version 0.20.2 and later.
- The vulnerability is present in various forms of the library, including CDN hosted scripts, npm packages, and deno modules.
- CVSS v3.1 score: 7.5 (High), Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
