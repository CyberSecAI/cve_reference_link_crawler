Vulnerability description

The Oracle Enterprise Communications Broker

The   Oracle   Enterprise   Communication   Broker   is   a   core   communications   controller   used   to   route   SIP   sessions   across

files without being authenticated.

accessing exported log files.

Technical description and Proof-of-Concept

Vulnerability discovery

The files exposed in the URL /webapps/export/* are accessible for unauthenticated users.

Illustration 1: Accessing a SIP sessions summary without being authenticated

When access control checks are not applied, users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be
allowed to perform.

It allows an attacker to:

•

•

understand many technical details related to the VoIP infrastructure,

list previously made and on-going calls including the identity of callers and callees.
