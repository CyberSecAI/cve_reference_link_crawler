- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The logic for the UI upgrade process in Mautic lacks access control to verify if the user has permission to perform the tasks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284). The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to Mautic version information and the potential execution of parts of the upgrade process without proper permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could access the Mautic version number and potentially execute parts of the upgrade process without authorization. This could lead to a compromise of the system's integrity and availability. The confidentiality of the version number is also at risk.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. They need network access to the vulnerable Mautic instance. The attack complexity is considered high.
