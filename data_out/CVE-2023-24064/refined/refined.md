{
  "CVE-2023-24064": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient integrity validation of the `/etc/inittab` file during the Pre-Boot Authentication (PBA) Phase I, which is part of Diebold Nixdorf's Vynamic Security Suite (VSS). The system does not validate this file, allowing modification and providing an attack vector to control the system's initialization process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient file integrity validation during PBA Phase I.",
       "Unencrypted Linux partition (P5) allows for modification.",
       "Reliance on a custom PBA implementation with vulnerabilities instead of standard FDE solutions.",
       "Inability to detect new files or modifications in non-validated locations during PBA."
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker with physical access can achieve code execution, privilege escalation, recovery of TPM-protected disk encryption keys, decryption of the Windows operating system, and implantation of malicious code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical access to the ATM.",
      "Modification of the `/etc/inittab` file on the unencrypted Linux partition (P5) to inject malicious code."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Physical access to the ATM to modify system files."
  },
  "CVE-2023-24063": {
     "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of the `/etc/mtab` file during system initialization. The system deletes `/etc/mtab` and recreates it based on `/etc/fstab`, however, `/etc/mtab` is not validated by PBA Phase I, and can be replaced with a symbolic link to `/etc/fstab` prior to the system mounting the filesystems, allowing modification of the filesystem mount procedure and enabling a bypass to the TMPFS mounts.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of integrity validation for `/etc/mtab` during PBA Phase I.",
      "Ability to manipulate the mount process via file redirection and symlinks.",
      "Unencrypted Linux partition (P5) allows for modification.",
      "Inability to detect new files or modifications in non-validated locations during PBA."
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker with physical access can gain code execution by manipulating the mount process, allowing them to bypass TMPFS mounts and execute malicious code before PBA Phase II.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical access to the ATM.",
      "Replacing `/etc/mtab` with a symlink to `/etc/fstab` on the unencrypted Linux partition (P5)."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Physical access to the ATM to modify system files."
  },
  "CVE-2023-24062": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient checks during the mounting of the root filesystem. By linking `/root`, `/tmp`, and `/var` to `/`, and then extracting archives to the root filesystem, an attacker can prevent the TMPFS mounts from occurring and gain persistent access to these directories, where they can inject malicious code.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Lack of proper validation for the mount point of the root filesystem.",
      "The reliance on directory deletion and re-creation during system initialization rather than an integrity check.",
      "Unencrypted Linux partition (P5) allows for modification.",
      "Inability to detect new files or modifications in non-validated locations during PBA."

     "Required attacker capabilities": "Physical access to the ATM to modify system files."
  },
    "CVE-2023-28865": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a result of the ability to redirect the execution of `/etc/rc.d/init.d/mountfs` to kernel runtime filesystems via symbolic link, which are not validated during PBA Phase I, and are mounted dynamically by the kernel. This allows the attacker to bypass the mountfs and gain code execution.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Failure to validate symbolic links to special kernel filesystems during PBA Phase I.",

    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Physical access to the ATM to modify system files."
  },
  "CVE-2023-33206": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the system not properly checking for broken symbolic links when it evaluates directories for null hash sums during PBA Phase I. Relocating directories to a broken symlink and disabling mountpoint and shutdown allows the attacker to bypass integrity checks, inject code, and gain control of the system.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper validation for broken symbolic links during PBA Phase I.",

     "Required attacker capabilities": "Physical access to the ATM to modify system files."
  },
   "CVE-2023-40261": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the ability to bypass Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) by removing the execute permissions from the IMA initialization script. The PBA validation process only checks file content and not file attributes, allowing an attacker to modify permissions of the ima script and disable the integrity checks, and execute unsigned binaries.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "PBA Phase I only validates file content, not permissions, allowing to disable IMA.",
       "Unencrypted Linux partition (P5) allows for modification.",
      "Reliance on IMA without proper protections to prevent it from being disabled."
