Internet passwords stored in Person documents in the Domino® Directory created using the "Add Person" action on the People & Groups tab in the Domino® Administrator are secured using a cryptographically weak hash algorithm.

This issue does not impact Person documents created through  user registration https://help.hcltechsw.com/domino/10.0.1/admin/conf_userregistration_c.html .
