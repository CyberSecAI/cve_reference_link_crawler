Based on the provided content, all the commits are related to the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The kunit tests for fortify were incorrectly using `vfree()` to free memory allocated by `kvmalloc()`, `kvmalloc_node()`, `kvzalloc()`, `kvzalloc_node()`, `kvcalloc()`, and `kvmalloc_array()`. These functions from the `kv*` family should be freed with `kvfree()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Mismatched allocation and deallocation functions. Using `vfree` to deallocate memory allocated by `kv*` functions leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Memory corruption due to incorrect deallocation. This can lead to system instability, crashes, and potentially other security vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
This is a bug in the kernel's test suite, not an easily exploitable vulnerability in a production system. An attacker might indirectly trigger this by exploiting other vulnerabilities in the kernel that eventually trigger the kunit tests. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trigger the kunit tests that use the flawed allocation/deallocation logic. This may not be a direct attack vector, but rather an indirect consequence of another exploit.
