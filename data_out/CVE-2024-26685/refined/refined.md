{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `async_write` flag was used as a marker for resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers(), leading to a crash. This flag was inappropriately applied to segment summary and super root blocks, which share buffers with the backing device.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect usage of the `async_write` flag in the nilfs2 filesystem.",
      "Race condition due to parallel writebacks of the backing device."
    ],
    "impact": "A BUG_ON failure could occur due to an abnormal condition of the buffer's `async_write` flag. This could lead to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered when there are parallel writebacks to the backing device that conflict with nilfs2's internal operations, specifically when handling segment summary and super root blocks.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to trigger write operations on a nilfs2 filesystem that would lead to concurrent writebacks on the backing device."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Removed manipulation of the async_write flag for super root block buffers.",
    "Removed usage of async_write for segment summary buffers (previous change)."
  ],
  "cvss_score": "NOINFO"
