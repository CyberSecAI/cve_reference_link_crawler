The provided content describes a bug in the Tegra I2C driver on ACPI machines, which is not related to CVE-2024-45029.

Specifically, the issue arises from calling a mutex within a spinlock during power management runtime resume. This occurs because `__pm_runtime_resume()` acquires a spinlock, and then `rpm_resume()` calls `acpi_subsys_runtime_resume()`, which attempts to acquire a mutex causing a sleeping function called from an invalid context error.

To resolve this, the driver is modified to avoid marking ACPI devices as IRQ-safe.

- **Root cause:** Calling a mutex inside a spinlock during the power management runtime resume process on ACPI machines.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Incorrect usage of locking primitives (mutex and spinlock) in the power management code path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The system might trigger a "sleeping function called from invalid context" error, potentially leading to system instability or a crash.
- **Attack vectors:** This isn't a traditional exploitable vulnerability. It is triggered during the normal power management operations on ACPI-based systems utilizing the tegra i2c driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No attacker action is required to trigger this bug. It is a software defect in driver interaction with power management on certain hardware configurations.
