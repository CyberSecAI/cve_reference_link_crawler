Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-23130:

**Root Cause:**
- A coding error exists in the SQL query engine memory allocation code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Over-read (CWE-126):** The vulnerability allows reading beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By executing a series of crafted SQL commands, an attacker can cause a crash of the SQL Query Engine, leading to the disabling of the SQL Server. This results in a denial-of-service condition, disrupting the functionality of GENESIS64 and MC Works64.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack involves importing a configuration file containing malicious stored procedures into GENESIS64 or MC Works64.
- Once imported, executing commands against the database from within the applications triggers the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access:** The attacker must be able to craft and provide a malicious configuration file to be imported by a legitimate user.
-   **Privilege:** A legitimate user with the ability to import configuration files must be involved to trigger the vulnerability.
-   **Complexity:** The attack has a high complexity, requiring specific knowledge to craft malicious SQL commands.
-   **Proximity:** The attack vector involves adjacent access.

**Affected Products and Versions**

-   **ICONICS Suite:** All versions up to and including 10.97
-   **Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64:** Versions 4.00A (v10.95.201.23) to 4.04E (v10.95.210.01)

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is triggered when specific SQL commands are executed against the database after importing the malicious configuration file.
- The provided text from Mitsubishi Electric confirms the vulnerability is a result of a "Buffer Over-read (CWE-126)".
- The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 5.9 with vector string (AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H)
