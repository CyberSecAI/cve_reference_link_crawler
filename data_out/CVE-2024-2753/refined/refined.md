Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization on the calendar color settings screen within Concrete CMS. A malicious administrator could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the color settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw, where malicious code is stored in the application's database. This code is then executed when other users access the affected page.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user-provided data (color settings), allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   When other users access the calendar color settings screen, the malicious JavaScript injected by the rogue administrator would execute.
*   This execution could allow the attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim user, steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or other malicious actions that can be performed with Javascript on the targeted web page.
*   The impact is limited to users accessing the color settings screen.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Concrete CMS administrator interface. A rogue administrator with the necessary privileges can inject the malicious JavaScript through the calendar color settings screen.
*   The malicious payload is then stored and executed on the client-side browser when other users access the same page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges within Concrete CMS. This allows them to access the color settings screen where the malicious injection takes place.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable input (calendar color settings) within the application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 2.0 with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `a3b5dddd26e38a693d4318fd424b3846dbab5826`.
*   The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne (report ID 2433383) by Rikuto Tauchi.
