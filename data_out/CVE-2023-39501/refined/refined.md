- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of OXPS files within PDF-XChange Editor, specifically due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it is dereferenced as a pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction, where the target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted OXPS file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious OXPS file or a link to such file to the victim.
