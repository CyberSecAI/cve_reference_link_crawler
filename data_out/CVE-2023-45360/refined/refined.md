Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-45360:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way MediaWiki handles internationalization (i18n) messages, specifically the "you have new messages" notifications. These messages, `youhavenewmessages` and `youhavenewmessagesmanyusers`, were not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. By adding malicious code (like `<script>alert(1);</script>`) to the message definitions through the MediaWiki interface, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript into the pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Privilege escalation:** A sysop (system operator) account could be used to inject malicious JavaScript, leading to potential privilege escalation or other malicious activities.
*   **Compromise of user accounts:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on their behalf.
*  **Data manipulation:** An attacker might be able to alter displayed content, steal information or make changes to the wiki.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious message modification:** An attacker needs to modify the `youhavenewmessages` or `youhavenewmessagesmanyusers` i18n messages, typically through the MediaWiki interface, by injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
*   **User interaction:** The injected code is executed when another user loads a page and is notified of new messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Account with editing privileges:** To modify these messages in MediaWiki, the attacker needs to have sufficient privileges, commonly a sysop account.
*   **Knowledge of MediaWiki:** The attacker needs to be familiar with how MediaWiki handles i18n messages and where they are defined, i.e., the `MediaWiki:Youhavenewmessagesfromusers` page.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involved adding `youhavenewmessagesmanyusers` and `youhavenewmessages` to the `$wgRawHtmlMessages` configuration variable. This tells MediaWiki that these messages contain raw HTML and should not be sanitized. This approach was taken because many existing MediaWiki instances were already utilizing custom HTML within these message definitions.
*   The fix was backported to multiple MediaWiki versions.
*   The provided text also highlights the importance of keeping documentation consistent with code changes. It was noted that updating the `includes/MainConfigSchema.php` file without running the `maintenance/generateConfigSchema.php` script would not apply the changes correctly.
