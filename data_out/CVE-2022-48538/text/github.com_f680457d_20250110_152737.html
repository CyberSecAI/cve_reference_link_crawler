| If you look at the release `lib/ldap.php`, it already includes all these variables as public. Are you sure you had the correct 1.2.23 `lib/ldap.php`? |

| Using PHP 8.2.1 on my system and pre-release of 1.2.24 and I see no such errors and `lib/ldap.php` has not been changed since the 1.2.23 release. Are you sure you have a good php?  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1439914/214296781-8dfb726b-539e-414e-aa38-5ad7a32f01b7.png) |

| You are right, the `lib/ldap.php` file was indeed not correct, probably still from 1.2.22 release. Sorry for the inconvenience. |
