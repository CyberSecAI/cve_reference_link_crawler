- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the login dialog box of SIMATIC WinCC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'). The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation leading to a buffer overflow when processing login credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can cause a persistent denial of service (DoS) condition in the runtime of the SCADA system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable SIMATIC WinCC product is running. No user interaction is required (UI:N) and no special privileges are needed (PR:N).
