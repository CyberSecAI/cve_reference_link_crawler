Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2477

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'Alternative Text' field of uploaded images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to:
  - Account hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker uploads an image with malicious JavaScript code in the 'Alternative Text' field using the WordPress media uploader, specifically within the wpDiscuz plugin.
- This malicious data is stored in the database.
- When the image is displayed on a page, the stored JavaScript is executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user with author-level access or higher in WordPress
- Ability to upload files

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in wpDiscuz plugin versions up to and including 7.6.15.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.6.16 by applying `esc_attr()` to the output of the alt tag. This function ensures that special characters are properly encoded and interpreted as text instead of executable code, preventing XSS.
- The vulnerable code is located in `wpdiscuz/trunk/utils/class.WpdiscuzHelperUpload.php`
- The fix was introduced in changeset [3060040](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3060040/wpdiscuz/trunk/utils/class.WpdiscuzHelperUpload.php).
