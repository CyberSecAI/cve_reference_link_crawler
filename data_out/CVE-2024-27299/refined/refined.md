Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the "Add News" functionality of phpMyFAQ.
*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `authorEmail` field when saving news entries.
*   Specifically, the application uses PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` for validation, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection. This field was not properly escaped before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core issue is that user-supplied input (`authorEmail`) is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The reliance on `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` alone was insufficient to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials.
*   **Account Takeover:** By extracting credentials or manipulating database records, attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific cases, especially when the PostgreSQL database is configured with superuser privileges, an attacker may be able to achieve RCE. This involves creating functions within the database to execute system commands, for example, writing a web shell.
*   **System File Access:** Attackers can use SQL queries to read sensitive system files.
*   **Denial of Service:** The time based SQL injection PoC (PoC 1) shows an attacker can induce delays in response time by leveraging `pg_sleep()`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the rights to add or edit FAQ news. This usually includes admin users, but can include other users with news authoring privileges.
*   **Web Access:** Access to the application's web interface is required.
*   **Request Interception:** Attackers need to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP request that saves the news (e.g., using a proxy like Burp Suite).

**Technical Details from the provided content:**
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `authorEmail` in the `/admin/?action=save-news` request is the primary target of injection.
*   **SQL Injection Technique:** The attacker injects SQL code within the `authorEmail` field, using specially crafted values. The `linkTitle` field was also used to execute the query.
*   **Example Payloads:**
    *   **Time-Based SQLi (Postgres):** `test'/*@[email.com](http://email.com/)` for `authorEmail` and `*/,1,1,1,1,1,1,1);select+pg_sleep(5)--` for `linkTitle` to verify injection by induced delay.
    *   **Data Extraction:** `test'/*@[email.com](http://email.com/)` for `authorEmail` and `*/,1,1,1,1,1,1,1);SELECT+remember_me+FROM+faquser+limit+1+offset+1%3b--` for `linkTitle` to extract the `remember_me` field from the `faquser` table.
    *  **File Reading:** `test'/*@[email.com](http://email.com/)` for `authorEmail` and `*/,1,1,1,1,1,(select+pg_read_file(CONCAT(CHR(67),CHR(58),CHR(92),CHR(87),CHR(105),CHR(110),CHR(100),CHR(111),CHR(119),CHR(115),CHR(92),CHR(119),CHR(105),CHR(110),CHR(46),CHR(105),CHR(110),CHR(105)))),1)--` for `linkTitle` to read the content of `C:\Windows\win.ini` file.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** The RCE PoC (described in the link to Google Drive) involves creating a table to store the payload, a function to execute the commands, and writing a PHP shell.

*   **Affected Versions:** phpMyFAQ version 3.2.5
*   **Patched Versions:** phpMyFAQ version 3.2.6 (The patch involved properly escaping the `authorEmail` using the database escape function).
