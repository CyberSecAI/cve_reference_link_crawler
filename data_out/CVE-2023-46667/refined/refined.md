Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Fleet Server logging Agent enrollment tokens in plain text within its log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Agent enrollment tokens, which are sensitive credentials, are written to log files without proper sanitization or encryption.
- **Insecure Logging Practices:** The default logging level (`info`) includes messages containing the sensitive tokens, exacerbating the exposure risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Agent Enrollment:** An attacker gaining access to the logs can extract the enrollment tokens and use them to enroll new, potentially malicious, agents into the Fleet management system.
- **Access to Secrets:** Enrolled agents can be used to retrieve other secrets stored in the agent policies, including credentials for Elasticsearch and third-party services.
- **Arbitrary Event Injection:** Malicious agents can send arbitrary events to the Elasticsearch cluster, leading to potential data manipulation or service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log File Access:** Attackers could gain access to the Fleet Server's log files through various means, such as:
    - Compromising the server's filesystem.
    - Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that manage or store the logs.
    - Obtaining unauthorized access to log aggregation platforms or tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Logs:** The attacker needs to have read access to the Fleet Server's log files. This could be from local file system, or from a centralized logging system.
- **Basic Understanding of Fleet Management:** The attacker needs to understand how to use the enrollment tokens to enroll agents and gain unauthorized access.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability affects Fleet Server versions 8.10.0 to 8.10.2.
- The issue is identified by the advisory ESA-2023-20.
- Mitigation steps include upgrading to version 8.10.3 or later, changing log levels, and redacting sensitive information from existing logs.
- Workarounds for systems that cannot be immediately upgraded include changing the logging level to `warning`, disabling logs shipping to Elasticsearch, and redacting sensitive information.

**CVSS Score:**
- The provided CVSS v3 score is 8.1 (High), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.
