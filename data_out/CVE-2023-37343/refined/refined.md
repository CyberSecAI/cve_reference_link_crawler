- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JP2 files within Kofax Power PDF. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing JP2 files. This missing validation allows for a write operation beyond the allocated memory buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation when parsing JP2 files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious JP2 file that, when processed by Kofax Power PDF, triggers the out-of-bounds write. User interaction is required, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing the crafted JP2 data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious JP2 file to a target user. The user must then interact with this malicious file by either visiting a malicious page containing it or opening the file directly.
