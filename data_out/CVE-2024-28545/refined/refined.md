{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `deviceName` parameter is directly passed to a `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to the `/goform/setUsbUnload` endpoint with a crafted `deviceName` parameter containing shell commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device's web interface."
