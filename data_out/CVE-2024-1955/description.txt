The Hide Dashboard Notifications plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'warning_notices_settings' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to modify the plugin's settings.
