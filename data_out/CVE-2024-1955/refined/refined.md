Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1955

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `warning_notices_settings` function within the Hide Dashboard Notifications plugin. This function is responsible for handling the plugin's settings modifications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly verify if the user has the required permissions to modify the plugin settings.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The settings page was accessible to authenticated users with contributor access and above without verifying if they have the necessary privileges to modify the plugin's settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Settings Modification:** An attacker with contributor access or higher can modify the plugin's settings, such as which notifications to hide or which user roles are affected. This could lead to:
    - Disrupting the user experience by hiding important notifications from administrators.
    - Hiding security-related notifications, potentially leading to delayed detection of vulnerabilities or compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to the WordPress site's admin panel.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the target WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least the "contributor" role.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site's admin panel.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.3.1 by adding capability checks to the affected functions.
- The `add_shortcode` call on line 56 is also removed in the patched version.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
- The provided files show code changes that add capability checks using `current_user_can('manage_options')` to prevent unauthorized access.
