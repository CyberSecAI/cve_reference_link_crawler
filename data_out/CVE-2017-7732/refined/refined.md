- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the FortiMail's customized webmail login page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability. The customized pre-authentication webmail login page does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected into the page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that, when accessed by a user, injects JavaScript into the customized webmail login page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs with malicious JavaScript code and persuade the victim to click on it or access the vulnerable login page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special access to the FortiMail system.
