| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance and Firepower Threat Defense Software Command Injection Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-asaftd-cmd-inj-ZJV8Wysm  First Published: 2024 April 24 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwi90040](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi90040)     CVE-2024-20358     CWE-78       CVSS Score: [Base 6.0](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20358     CWE-78       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-cmd-inj-ZJV8Wysm/csaf/cisco-sa-asaftd-cmd-inj-ZJV8Wysm.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) restore functionality that is available in Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with *root*-level privileges. *Administrator*-level privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.  This vulnerability exists because the contents of a backup file are improperly sanitized at restore time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by restoring a crafted backup file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as *root*.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-cmd-inj-ZJV8Wysm>  For more information on the vulnerability that is described in this advisory, see [Cisco Event Response: Attacks Against Cisco Firewall Platforms](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/asa_ftd_attacks_event_response).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software. No specific configuration is required.  **Note:** Cisco FTD Software is affected only when lockdown mode has been enabled to restrict Linux shell access. Lockdown mode is disabled by default. When lockdown mode is disabled, Linux shell access, including *root*-level shell access, is readily available through the **expert** CLI command on devices that are running Cisco FTD Software. For more information on lockdown mode, see the [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Hardening Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/hardening/threat_defense/Threat_Defense_Hardening_Guide_v72.html#id_106776).  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products and services listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.  Details  * This vulnerability affects the Cisco ASA **restore** CLI command that is described in the [Software and Configurations](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa916/configuration/general/asa-916-general-config/admin-swconfig.html#ID-2152-00000a71) chapter of the *Cisco ASA Series General Operations CLI Configuration Guide*.  The backup restore functionalities that are documented in the [System Management](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-700/fptd-fdm-mgmt.html#id_14714) chapter of the *Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager* and the [Backup and Restore](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/backup_and_restore.html#Cisco_Concept.dita_f4d0d09c-70e9-440d-80c3-6fa16d1afb37) chapter of the *Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide* are *not affected* by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5. Click **Check**.
