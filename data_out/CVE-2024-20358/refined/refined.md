- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of the contents of a backup file during the restore process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78). Specifically, the Cisco ASA `restore` CLI command is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system with root-level privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to restore a crafted backup file to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local, administrator-level privileges on the affected device.
