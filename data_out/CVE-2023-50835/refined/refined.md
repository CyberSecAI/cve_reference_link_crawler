- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Advanced Category Template Plugin version 0.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability is present in the plugin.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**:  A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, would perform actions on behalf of that user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a higher-privileged user to trigger a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
