Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-3618.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application directly concatenates user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) into an SQL query without any sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `/control/activate_case.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate the `id` parameter to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- This could lead to data manipulation, exfiltration, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/control/activate_case.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and have knowledge of the application's URL structure.
