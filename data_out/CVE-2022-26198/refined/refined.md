The provided content discusses a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Notable application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of filtering when editing text, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unfiltered text editing, which allows injection of arbitrary code within an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler.
- Use of `require('child_process').exec` to execute OS commands based on user-provided input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- The specific example provided demonstrates the ability to run the `whoami` command which leaks user information and can be used as the basis for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a malicious `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler into the text editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to edit text within the Notable application. This suggests the attacker needs to be a user of the application.
- No other specific attacker capabilities are mentioned.

**Additional information:**
- The provided payload demonstrates the usage of `require('child_process').exec` within an `onerror` event handler of an `<img>` tag.
- This issue was fixed in the beta versions of Notable (<https://github.com/notable/notable-insiders/releases/>).
- Older versions of the application are not maintained and are vulnerable.
