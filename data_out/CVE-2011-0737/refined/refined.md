The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion, which include SQL DB Structure Extraction, Full Path Disclosure, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerabilities stem from the way Adobe ColdFusion handles errors and user inputs, specifically in the detailed error message pages. Insufficient sanitization and validation of user-supplied parameters and user agent headers leads to these vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL DB Structure Extraction:** When a specific query parameter (`id`) is given a hyphen ("-") it reveals information about the SQL query being used by the web application. This can expose sensitive database structures.

2.  **Full Path Disclosure:** By using the same technique as above, the server reveals the full server path to the application.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   By injecting a malicious script in the User-Agent header (e.g., `Mozilla<body onload=alert(document.cookie)>`), it's possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, as the error page reflects this unsanitized header.
    *   Also through the `id` parameter by injecting html: `%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL DB Structure Extraction:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the database structure, which can be used for more advanced attacks such as SQL injection.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Attackers can learn the full file system path of the application, which can aid in other attacks, like finding configuration files with sensitive info.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can execute malicious scripts in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement of websites, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Crafted URL parameters (e.g., `id=-`)
*   Manipulated `User-Agent` header

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP requests to a vulnerable ColdFusion application.
*   The attacker requires no prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs to know or guess the path to a vulnerable page and parameter name.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The XSS vulnerability via `<script>` tag was fixed in later versions of Adobe ColdFusion, but other vectors, like `<body>` tag, may still be vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe privately, but was ignored.
*   The provided URL is a Ukrainian security blog, the translation is included.
*   The article suggests that all Adobe ColdFusion versions are potentially vulnerable.
