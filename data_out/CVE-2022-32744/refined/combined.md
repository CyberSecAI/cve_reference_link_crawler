## CVE-2022-32744.html:

```

===========================================================
== Subject:     Samba AD users can forge password change requests for
==              any user.
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2022-32744
==
== Versions:    Samba 4.3 and later
==
== Summary:     The KDC accepts kpasswd requests encrypted with any
==              key known to it. By encrypting forged kpasswd requests
==              with its own key, a user can change the passwords of
==              other users, enabling full domain takeover.
===========================================================

===========
Description
===========

Tickets received by the kpasswd service were decrypted without
specifying that only that service's own keys should be tried. By
setting the ticket's server name to a principal associated with their
own account, or by exploiting a fallback where known keys would be
tried until a suitable one was found, an attacker could have the
server accept tickets encrypted with any key, including their own.

A user could thus change the password of the Administrator account and
gain total control over the domain. Full loss of confidentiality and
integrity would be possible, as well as of availability by denying
users access to their accounts.

In addition, the kpasswd service would accept tickets encrypted by the
krbtgt key of an RODC, in spite of the fact that RODCs should not have
been able to authorise password changes.

==================
Patch Availability
==================

Patches addressing this issue have been posted to:

    https://www.samba.org/samba/security/

Additionally, Samba 4.16.4, 4.15.9, and 4.14.14 have been issued
as security releases to correct the defect. Samba administrators are
advised to upgrade to these releases or apply the patch as soon
as possible.

==================
CVSSv3 calculation
==================

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.8)

==========
Workaround
==========

kpasswd is not a critical protocol for the AD DC in most installations, it can
be disabled by setting "kpasswd port = 0" in the smb.conf.

=======
Credits
=======

Initial report, patches, and this advisory by Joseph Sutton of
Catalyst and the Samba Team.
