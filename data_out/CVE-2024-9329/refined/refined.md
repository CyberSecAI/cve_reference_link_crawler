{
  "CVE-2024-9329": {
    "Description": "The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is '/management/domain'. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.",
    "Root cause": "Improper Handling of Parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-233"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behaviour can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application. The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain.",
    "Attack vector": "The application presents an Open Redirect on the Host parameter, when the /management/domain endpoint is requested via an HTTP GET request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target application."
