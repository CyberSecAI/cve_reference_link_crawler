Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application fails to validate user-supplied data, specifically the `task` parameter in `delete-task.php`.
*   It does not sanitize or filter special characters in the input.
*   The unsanitized input is directly incorporated into a SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `task` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to extract the database user.
*   **Potential for further damage:** An attacker could potentially manipulate or delete data, depending on the database permissions and the attacker's malicious code, or potentially achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to `delete-task.php`.
*   **`task` parameter:** The attack vector is the `task` parameter, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** Some understanding of SQL is needed to craft malicious SQL injection payloads, but tools such as sqlmap can automate the process
