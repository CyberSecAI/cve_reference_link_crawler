- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The read out protection of the internal flash of affected devices was not properly set at the end of the manufacturing process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284) leading to the ability to read out the data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access can read out the data stored in the device's internal flash memory. The specific data that can be read is not specified in the advisory.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the affected device. No specific level of technical knowledge is mentioned, suggesting the read-out process is achievable by an attacker with basic capabilities.
