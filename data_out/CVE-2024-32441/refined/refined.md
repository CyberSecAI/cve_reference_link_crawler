- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Zoho Campaigns plugin (<= 2.0.7) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that forces a logged-in user's browser to perform actions on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into submitting a crafted request. The attacker does not require any authentication with the vulnerable system, as they leverage the victim's existing session.
