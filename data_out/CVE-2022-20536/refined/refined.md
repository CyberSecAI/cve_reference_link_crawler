Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check when registering a receiver for the `ACTION_TTY_PREFERRED_MODE_CHANGE` intent. This allows unprivileged apps to send the intent to `RcsService`, which should only be triggered by privileged apps.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing permission check:** The core weakness is the failure to enforce the `MODIFY_PHONE_STATE` permission when a broadcast receiver registers for `ACTION_TTY_PREFERRED_MODE_CHANGE` intent.
- **Unprotected Broadcast:** The `ACTION_TTY_PREFERRED_MODE_CHANGE` intent was not protected, enabling any application to send this intent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** By sending the `ACTION_TTY_PREFERRED_MODE_CHANGE` intent, an unprivileged application can cause the `RcsService` to perform actions that should only be triggered by privileged apps. This results in an unwanted behavior and potentially, elevation of privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious application:** An attacker could craft a malicious application that sends the `ACTION_TTY_PREFERRED_MODE_CHANGE` intent without proper permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to install an app:** The attacker needs to be able to install an application on the vulnerable device.
- **No special permissions needed initially:** The attacker does not need any special permissions to send the vulnerable broadcast.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding the `MODIFY_PHONE_STATE` permission check for the receiver of the `ACTION_TTY_PREFERRED_MODE_CHANGE` intent. This ensures that only privileged apps can trigger the intent.
- The commit message explicitly states the intent of preventing the `RcsService` from receiving the intent from unprivileged applications.
- A test was implemented to check the permission denial of the broadcasted intent.
