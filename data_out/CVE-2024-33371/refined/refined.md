The provided content describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in DedeCMS V5.7.113.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization for the `typeid` parameter in the `makehtml_list_action.php` file. User-supplied input through this parameter is directly used in the application without any processing or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the direct use of unsanitized user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable page.
- When a user visits the page, the attacker's script will execute within the user's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on the user's behalf.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes the malicious script in the `typeid` parameter.
- An example URL provided is: `http://127.0.0.1/uploads/dede/makehtml_list_action.php?typeid=%3C/sCrIpT%3E%3CsCrIpT%3Ealert(1)%3C/sCrIpT%3E`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that contains malicious JavaScript code in the `typeid` parameter.
- The attacker must be able to trick users into visiting the malicious URL or find a way to embed the link on a site they know users would visit.
