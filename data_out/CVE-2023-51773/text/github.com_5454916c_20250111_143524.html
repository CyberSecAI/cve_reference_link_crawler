  entire code base except external/ folders. (#755)
* Added RP and RPM error code indications in callbacks in bac-rw.c
  module handling. (#756)
* Added editorconfig, a widely used and supported file in profession IDEs.
  The configuration file indicates how files should be formatted. (#753)
* Added pre-commit configuration which can automatically check some basic
  code formatting rules everytime someone makes commit. This can also be
  used in the pipeline during a pull-request for automated checking.
  pre-commit can also be used in a local workspace or within an IDE.
  pre-commit makes it easy to select clang-format version so everyone is
  using same one.
* Added basic object-name get for ASCII names to enable free if they were
  dynamically created. Added unit testing to validate the basic object
  ASCII object-name API. (#754)

### Changed

* Changed the lint apt install in quality pipeline to be consistent (#837)

* Changed BACnet Ethernet and IPv6 on win32 by switching from
  WinPcap to npcap. Included npcap SDK in cmake and libs for
  IPv6 in cmake. (#774)
* Changed pipeline gcc.yml to reduce known warnings from legacy
  API by adding LEGACY flag to make bip-apps with GNU99. (#795)
* Changed ATmega168 example for ATmega328 on Arduino Uno R3 with DFR0259
  RS485 shield. Added ADC interface from BDK port and mapped to some AV
  objects. Removed MS/TP MAC address DIP switch GPIO and moved MS/TP
  configuration to AV objects. Added AV units property. Added some
  Uno R3 Digital Inputs and outputs mapped to some BV. Added AVR EEPROM
  from BDK port and mapped some non-volatile data
  including MAC address and max manager and baud rate,
  device ID and names and description and location. (#784)
* Changed the datalink abstraction to enable selecting multiple datalinks
  using BACDL\_MULTIPLE and one or more other BACDL defines. (#717)
* Moved west manifest, zephyr folder, and ports/zephyr folders to
  another repository <https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack-zephyr>
  so that the rapid pace of Zephyr OS development changes will have
  a less impact on the development of the BACnet Stack library. (#757)
* Removed static scope on character array used for object-name since the array
  gets copied into characterstring array and static is not needed. (#754)
* Changed clang-format rules to always align const to left side,
  and insertbraces to avoid having to use clang-tidy. (#753)
* Moved external files, such as driver libraries, to external/ folders.
  It is lot easier to work with automatic formatters if we have external
  files in different folder. For some tools we can just exclude
  external folder all together. (#744)
* Changed most of the functions use of pointer parameters to const.
  Used clang-tidy and sonarlint to help find places where const could be
  easily applied. (#714)
* Changed bacapp\_snprintf\_value() to be const correct. After that
  we got a warning that the 4th function call argument is an uninitialized
  value in bacapp\_snprintf\_weeklyschedule(). Fixed the warning by setting
  array\_index to zero. (#714)

  mode address 255. Fixed MS/TP receive filter for valid data frames which
  was missing. Fixed MS/TP zero-config duplicate node detection. Reset
  silence during MS/TP capture after writing packet to prevent endless
  packets when stream is interrupted. (#812)
* Fixed the Linux MSTP turnaround delay implementation. (#809)
* Fixed app/router compiled with optimize Os when the program exits with
  bit out of range 0 - FD\_SETSIZE on fd\_set. Solution disables optimize
  for size by static set optimize 2 for GCC. Fixes (#793) (#808)

  Fixed RPM-Ack processing for end of list-of-results. Added minimal
  handling for segmentation-not-supported during RPM of object
  properties. (#765)

* Added missing object functions to analog inputs and values. (#568)

### Changed

* Changed BACnet R/W FSM module to remove dependency on
  rpm\_ack\_decode\_service\_request() which uses large calloc/free
  value lists. Created an alternate RPM-ACK to RP-ACK processing
  function. (#583)
* Changed basic RPM handler to skip over unknown property values. (#583)

### Security

* Secured the following services by refactoring the size check
  and refactoring the service requests from the service header,
  adding APDU size checking and length features, and adding unit
  tests to check for length when passing NULL buffer:
  ARF/AWF/COV/CO/DO/DCC/Event/GE/ALE/RLE/LSO/RD/RR/RP/WP. (#553)

### Added

* Added bacapp decoding for accumulator SCALE property. (#566)
* Added a MS/TP zero-config (automatically choose an unused MAC address)
  using an algorithm that starts with MAC=64 and waits for a random number
  of PFM (minimum of 8 plus modulo 64) before attempting to choose a MAC
  sequentially from 64..127. The confirmation uses a 128-bit UUID with the
  MSTP Test Request frame. The modifications are in src/bacnet/datalink/mstp.c
  and src/bacnet/datalink/dlmstp.c modules enabling any device to use
  zero-config if enabled. A working demonstration is in the ports/stm32f4xx
  for the NUCLEO board. Complete unit testing is included. Options include
  lurking forever (wait for a router or another master node before joining)
  or lurking for a minimum time (enables self forming automatic MAC addressing
  device nodes). (#564)

### Changed

* Modified example objects to support CreateObject and DeleteObject API for
  these objects: file, analog output, binary output, multi-state output, color,
  color temperature).
* Unit tests and functional tests have been moved from the source C files
  into their own test files under the test folder in a src/ mirrored folder
  structure under test/.
* The testing framework was moved from ctest to ztest, using CMake, CTest, and LCOV.
  It's now possible to visually view code coverage from the testing of each file
  in the library. The tests are run in continuous integration.  Adding new tests
  can be done by as copying an existing folder under test/ as a starting point, and
  adding the new test folder name into the CMakeLists.txt under test/ folder, or
  editing the existing test C file and extending or fixing the existing test.
* Most (all?) of the primitive value encoders are now using a snprintf()
  style API pattern, where passing NULL in the buffer parameter will
  return the length that the buffer would use (i.e. returns the length that the
  buffer needs to be).  This makes simple to write the parent encoders to check
  the length versus their buffer before attempting the encoding at the expense of
  an extra function call to get the length.
* BACnetARRAY property types now have a helper function to use for encoding (see bacnet\_array\_encode)

## Deprecated

* Added BACNET\_STACK\_DEPRECATED for functions which will be removed in a future
  release, with a suggested replacement function to use instead.
