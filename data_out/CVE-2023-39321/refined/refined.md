Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-39321

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `QUICConn.HandleData` function in the `crypto/tls` package of the Go programming language incorrectly handles partial post-handshake messages, leading to a panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Size Check:** The size check within `QUICConn.HandleData` was flawed, allowing partial messages to be passed to `handlePostHandshakeMessage`.
- **Partial Message Handling:** `handlePostHandshakeMessage` was not designed to handle partial messages, causing a panic when it tried to read the remainder of the message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause a panic, leading to a denial of service. This could crash the application using the vulnerable Go code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a partial post-handshake message to a QUIC connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a service utilizing the affected Go code and the QUIC protocol.
- No authentication is required; an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability if the application is configured to accept QUIC connections.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Go versions 1.21.1 and 1.20.8.
- A related vulnerability, CVE-2023-39322, is also mentioned, concerning the lack of a limit on buffered post-handshake data in `HandleData`.
- This vulnerability is considered to have a "HIGH" severity rating according to NetApp and a "high" severity by Gentoo.
- A patch was released to address the vulnerability, and a backport was provided for Go 1.21.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Marten Seemann.
