This CVE is described as a 'mysql: Server: Optimizer unspecified vulnerability (CPU Apr 2018)'. The advisory indicates that the MySQL server's optimizer has an unspecified vulnerability, which is part of a larger batch of fixes included in the update to rh-mysql57-mysql (version 5.7.24). The advisory lists a number of other CVEs that are also fixed by this update, focusing on a range of issues across the MySQL server including replication, privileges, InnoDB engine, client programs, and more. The impact of the specific CVE is not described in detail beyond it being a moderate security risk. The affected products list a wide array of Red Hat Software Collections across various RHEL versions and architectures. The advisory includes a link to a knowledge base article that describes how to apply the update. Additionally, the advisory states the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be automatically restarted after the update.",

      "content": "The NetApp document discusses multiple MySQL vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-2812, affecting NetApp products that incorporate Oracle MySQL. It states that versions of MySQL through 5.5.59, 5.6.39, and 5.7.21 are vulnerable to attacks that may lead to unauthorized takeover of the MySQL server, unauthorized access to data, or denial of service. For CVE-2018-2812 specifically, the CVSS v3 score is 5.5 (MEDIUM), with the vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H. This indicates a network-based attack vector, requiring low complexity, high privileges for the attacker, no user interaction, with no change to scope, no impact to confidentiality, low impact on integrity, and high impact on availability. This implies an attacker with administrative level access could possibly degrade availability.  The document lists affected NetApp products and provides links to download fixes, and outlines various other products that are not affected. It also includes workarounds, and references the Oracle CPU advisory.",
