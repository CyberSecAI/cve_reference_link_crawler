## Leave the infrastructure busywork behind you

We handle the backend so you can focus on what truly drives your projects forward.

![icon illustrating developer freedom](/images/index/developer-freedom.webp)
##### Developer Freedom

Use any framework, library, or tool—no lock-in, no limits.

![icon illustrating developer freedom](/images/index/experiment-and-deploy.webp)
##### Experiment and Deploy

Quickly spin up environments to test new ideas, then easily deploy them into production.

![icon illustrating developer freedom](/images/index/scale-without-the-headaches.webp)
##### Scale Without the Headaches

Scale fast—from proof-of-concept to production-ready applications.

![icon illustrating developer freedom](/images/index/high-security.webp)
##### High-Security

Avoid costly mistakes with built-in safeguards for your IP and data.

## Saturn Cloud at a glance

![](/images/docs/resource_secret_page.webp)
##### Step 1: Configure credentials for data access and Git

Code that runs in Saturn Cloud is just vanilla Python and R code. We load
your code from Git and it reads data from the same place it currently reads from. We use IAM roles when possible to
authenticate and and encrypted secrets otherwise.

![](/images/docs/new-image-version-form.webp)
##### Step 2: Specify the libraries your code needs

Everything running in Saturn Cloud runs in a Docker container. Bring your own docker images, or
customize our images with the Saturn Cloud image builder. Developing in docker means your work is much more reproducible..

![](/images/IDEs.webp)
##### Step 3: Develop in the cloud with JupyterLab, PyCharm or VS Code

Saturn Cloud Development Workspaces feel like developing on laptops, except you have much better hardware.
Workspaces support SSH so you can connect any desktop IDE like PyCharm or VS Code.

![](/images/Live-Data-Science-Dashboard.webp)
##### Step 4: Deploy your work as a deployment or a job

Code deployed in Saturn Cloud runs in the exact same environment it was written in. Deployments can be any web application. Build dashboards with Streamlit, Shiny, Plotly, or Bokeh. Deploy models with Bento ML or FastAPI. Jobs can be any script. Use them for daily ETL or model retraining.

  SourceForge

  ![](/icons/five-stars.svg)Unleashing the full potential of open-source LLMs was made possible thanks to Saturn Cloud. Allowing me to add GPUs seamlessly immensely accelerated my experimentation process, providing a highly customized sandbox-like environment, ideal for any task that can benefit from the specialization of customized machine learning and data science.

  ### Daniel B

  ML Scientist, Cellarity

  ![](/icons/five-stars.svg)Saturn Cloud makes my work so much easier. When I sit down at the beginning of the day, I just want my environment to work. I want my favorite packages installed and available on demand. I want it to be easy to scale my workspace and have it shut down automatically when I'm done. Saturn Cloud solves all of that. Their customer service is also top-notch.

  ### Engineer

  TrustRadius

  ![](/icons/five-stars.svg)Saturn Cloud is a great platform for training AI models. It is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface. I have used it to train BERT models, and it has helped me speed up the training process significantly. I would recommend Saturn Cloud to anyone looking to train AI models.

  ### Seth Weisberg

  Principle ML Scientist, Senseye

  ![](/icons/five-stars.svg)Taking runtime down from 60 days to 11 hours is such an incredible improvement. We are able to fit in many more iterations on our models. This has a significant positive impact on the effectiveness of our product, which takes many iterations to perform at the standard necessary for our customers.
