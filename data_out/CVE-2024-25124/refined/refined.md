Additionally, some applications make URL parsing mistakes or blindly trust all subdomains including non-existent ones.  Some servers are also vulnerable by whitelisting the `null` origin, due to its association with local files, which could enable easy exploitation via sandboxed iframes. Some servers reflect the Origin header without sanitizing it, and may fail to restrict the origin protocol (allowing HTTP requests to access HTTPS secured resources)."
