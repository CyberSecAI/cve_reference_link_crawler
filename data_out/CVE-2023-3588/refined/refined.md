{
  "CVE-2023-3588": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization when handling user-provided data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious scripts through input fields or data that are stored on the server and later displayed to other users.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to inject the malicious script through an interface. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated."
