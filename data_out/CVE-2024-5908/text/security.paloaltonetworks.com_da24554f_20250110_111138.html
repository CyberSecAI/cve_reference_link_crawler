### Description

A problem with the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app can result in exposure of encrypted user credentials, used for connecting to GlobalProtect, in application logs. Normally, these application logs are only viewable by local users and are included when generating logs for troubleshooting purposes. This means that these encrypted credentials are exposed to recipients of the application logs.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| GlobalProtect App 6.2 | < 6.2.3 on Windows and macOS, None on Linux | >= 6.2.3 on Windows and macOS, All on Linux |
| GlobalProtect App 6.1 | < 6.1.3 on Windows and macOS, None on Android and iOS, < 6.1.3 on Linux | >= 6.1.3 on Windows and macOS, All on Android and iOS, >= 6.1.3 on Linux |
| GlobalProtect App 6.0 | < 6.0.8 on Windows and macOS, All on Linux | >= 6.0.8 on Windows and macOS, None on Linux |
| GlobalProtect App 5.1 | < 5.1.12 on Windows and macOS, All on Linux | >= 5.1.12 on Windows and macOS, None on Linux |

### Severity: MEDIUM, Suggested Urgency: MODERATE

CVSS-B:
5.5 ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/AU:N/R:U/V:D/RE:M/U:Amber](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/AU:N/R:U/V:D/RE:M/U:Amber))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 6.0.8, GlobalProtect app 6.1.3, GlobalProtect app 6.2.3, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Customers looking to protect against the impact of this encrypted password disclosure should first delete PanGPA.log files from the GlobalProtect installation directory on all endpoints and then force a rotation of user passwords that are used to connect to GlobalProtect.

### Acknowledgments

Palo Alto Networks thanks Denis Faiustov and Ruslan Sayfiev of GMO Cybersecurity by IERAE for discovering and reporting this issue.
