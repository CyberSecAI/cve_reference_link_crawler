- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app improperly handles encrypted user credentials, including username and password, and writes them to application log files (PanGPA.log), where they can be exposed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Insertion of sensitive information (encrypted user credentials) into log files (CWE-532).
    - Exposure of encrypted credentials to recipients of the application logs.
-  **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Exposure of user credentials used to connect to GlobalProtect.
    - Potential compromise of user accounts if the encryption is weak or can be broken.
    -  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the system can be impacted
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: A remote attacker could obtain the log files, which might contain exposed credentials, if the log files are transmitted.
    - Local access to the endpoint where the GlobalProtect application is installed: Local users can view the log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  Access to log files:  Either a local user on the system, or someone who gains access to the logs if they are transmitted.
    - No special privileges are required to view the log files
    - Requires user interaction - logs need to be generated.
