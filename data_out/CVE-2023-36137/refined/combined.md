## Class Scheduling System

![Announce classes on your site](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/show-all-available-classes-thumb.jpg)

Show all available classes

The course scheduling system allows you to announce an unlimited number of classes on your site. Add a relevant image and a detailed description about each class, set the start and end dates, specify maximum class size and price – and you're ready to publish the course! After adding teachers, you will be able to assign them to classes.

![Simple online bookings](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/allow-students-to-book-online-thumb.jpg)

Allow students to book online and on the go

Site visitors can reserve their place at the selected class through a quick and intuitive online booking process. On the booking page, they only need to choose the class they would like to attend, select the preferred teacher and course dates, and then enter their personal details. If payments are enabled, students will be requested to choose how they would like to pay. Students and teachers can access the booking system easily from any device – no separate mobile app is needed.

![Set up class schedule](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/compile-your-course-schedule-thumb.jpg)

Compile course schedules

With our online course booking system, administrators can schedule classes with ease – add new classes, organize all classes into a timetable, and manage schedules. To add a new class into your course schedule, just pick a class from the drop-down menu and then choose the date and time, select the teacher name, and specify the premises where the class will be held.

![Manage class bookings](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/review-and-manage-bookings-thumb.jpg)

Review and manage bookings

You can follow up and edit class reservations from a designated menu on the back-end Admin Panel. If necessary, admins can also add bookings manually. They can change a reservation's status with a single mouse click, sort bookings by status, check student information, keep track of received and pending payments, etc.

![Present class teachers](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/create-vivid-teacher-profiles-thumb.jpg)

Create vivid teacher profiles

The class scheduling software has a built-in teachers module that allows admins and registered lecturers to add and update their business cards. Having the chance to read more about each teacher’s life and expertise and to see their profile photos in advance is a good way for students to make better choices and bring students and teachers closer.

![Review student details](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/collect-a-rich-student-database-thumb.jpg)

Collect a rich student database

All details of students that have booked a course are collected and stored in the Students menu on the Admin Panel. You can sort them by class, monitor their payments, and view their contact details if you need to inform them about any unexpected schedule changes and other events. You can also create new student accounts through the back end of the class booking system. The MySQL database and all your files can easily be backed up with one click.

![Different notification types](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/email-and-sms-notifications-thumb.jpg)

Email & SMS notifications

Send email and SMS notifications to students and teachers to reduce no-shows and improve user experience. With our class scheduling software, you can customize various confirmation messages and notifications that will be automatically sent to students and administrators after each booking, payment, cancellation, etc. The script also lets you enable SMS notifications for which you need an API key. Find out more about enabling [SMS notifications](web-sms).

![Online and offline payments](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/process-various-payments-thumb.jpg)

Process payments in various ways

The Class Scheduling System supports all kinds of online and offline payments. PayPal and Authorize.net are integrated by default and are ready to use. If you need any other payment gateway on your site, [view more payment methods here](payment-gateways.php). Course attendants can also use the standard offline payment options, such as wire transfer or credit card.

![Admins, teachers and students access](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/multi-level-user-access-thumb.jpg)

Multi-level user access

All participants in the educational process (organizers, teachers, students) can access different areas of the online course booking system. Administrators have full access to all menus and can manage all settings. Teachers and students can log in to their own profiles, edit details, check class schedules – students can also make payments, etc.

![Customize class booking form](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/customizable-booking-form-thumb.jpg)

Customizable booking form

You can edit the checkout form that students have to fill out in order to make a booking. Just select the standard and required fields depending on the information you need for your database. You can show and hide the Notes box and enable the CAPTCHA field to avoid spam messages.

![Custom booking terms](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/add-your-booking-terms-thumb.jpg)

Add your booking terms

In order to finish their reservation, students have to accept your terms and conditions. Add them through the designated menu on the Admin Panel. You can access and edit the terms and conditions any time as needed.

Harford Christian is a very busy k-12 school with athletic team practices and games, fine arts practices and performances and many other special events throughout the year. The two PHP monthly calendars on the school site have performed flawlessly and allowed us the flexibility to change things daily and from any computer or mobile device. We have also been able to grow our categories and make them color coded for easy reference. I don't know what the organization would do without it.

Today, I want to share some vulnerabilities discovered through a recent collaborative security research project. This was done through a local group called the Atlantic CyberSecurity Collective.

Our team, consisting of a diverse and talented group of researchers, has conducted an extensive security review on the PHPJabbers collection of scripts, and during our research, we came across some significant security vulnerabilities. It’s worth mentioning that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could potentially pose serious threats to user data and the overall integrity of these products. We submitted our findings to MITRE, a globally recognized cybersecurity standards organization. Consequently, these vulnerabilities were validated and assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

* *CVE-2023–36132 Availability Booking v5.0*
* *CVE-2023–36133 Availability Booking v5.0*
* *CVE-2023–36131 Availability Booking v5.0*
* *CVE-2023–34869 Catering System v1.0*
* *CVE-2023–33562 Time Slots Booking Calendar v. 3.3*
* *CVE-2023–33563 Time Slots Booking Calendar v. 3.3*
* *CVE-2023–33564 Time Slots Booking Calendar v. 3.3*
* *CVE-2023–33561 Time Slots Booking Calendar v. 3.3*
* *CVE-2023–33560 Time Slots Booking Calendar v. 3.3*
* *CVE-2023–36135 Class scheduling System v. 1.0*
* *CVE-2023–36134 Class scheduling System v. 1.0*
* *CVE-2023–36137 Class scheduling System v. 1.0*
* *CVE-2023–36141 Cleaning Business Software v 1.0*
* *CVE-2023–36139 Cleaning Business Software v 1.0*
* *CVE-2023–36138 Cleaning Business Software v 1.0*
* *CVE-2023–36127 Appointment Scheduler — 3.0*
* *CVE-2023–36126 Appointment Scheduler — 3.0*

Note that we are all professionals with full time jobs and other responsibilities. With the sheer amount of products in the PHP Jabbers lineup and limited time available, we weren’t able to assess every single product. There is a lot of code reuse in those applications, so it would be safe to assume most vulnerabilities are present in other products.

Members of the research group conducted some additional research in PHP Jabbers products and found vulnerabilities which aren’t addressed in this disclosure.

We informed the PHP Jabbers team through their online forms, but were completely ignored. Each of our attempts at communicating these vulnerabilities was met with silence and an almost instantaneous “closed” status to our submitted tickets.

Our intentions behind sharing this information aren’t to tarnish the vendor’s reputation or stir up panic among its user base. Instead, we aim to encourage proactive and transparent collaboration within the cybersecurity community. It’s crucial to remember that we all share the same goal — enhancing the overall security of products and fostering a safer digital world for users.

In the sections to follow, we will delve into each of the identified vulnerabilities:

# #1: Username enumeration through “Forgot Password”

(CVE-2023–36132, CVE-2023–33562, CVE-2023–36135, CVE-2023–36141, CVE-2023–36127)

Click on Forgot Password, put in a random email address, and click “Send Password Reminder”. The system will inform you that the user does not exist. This allows us to know if a user is present or not:

![]()
# #2: Authenticated Account Takeover through Username/Password change.

(CVE-2023–36133, CVE-2023–33563, CVE-2023–36134, CVE-2023–36139)

Log in using the credentials provided. Click on Profile in the upper right corner. Change the email or password. The system won’t give you a security challenge. This allows anyone that has gained access to an account either through social engineering, stealing tokens, or simply accessing a computer where someone didn’t log in and completely take over the account. Since the email address is the username, the original owner has no way of recovering the account.

![]()
# #3: Reflected XSS in Theme Parameter of preview.php

(CVE-2023–33564, CVE-2023–36137, CVE-2023–36138, CVE-2023–36126)

Click on “Preview” in the left hand menu. Choose a Theme and click on “Open in new window”

![]()

Change the “theme” parameter value to: theme10dnel8%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(42)%3c%2fscript%3eko0so

![]()
# #4: Reflected XSS in cid Parameter of preview.php

(CVE-2023–33560)

Same as above, but change the cid parameter value to :
r5wx9%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(42)%3c%2fscript%3edv7zh

![]()
# #5: Reflected XSS in index of availability calendar (unauthenticated)

(CVE-2023–34869)

/index.php/hhax8"><script>alert(1)</script>bj1ovglnp21?controller=pjAdmin&action=pjActionLogin

![]()
# #6 Improper input validation of password parameter

(CVE-2023–36131, CVE-2023–33561)

A user can intercept the HTTP request and bypass password complexity, which can result in an insecure password containing only 1 character.
