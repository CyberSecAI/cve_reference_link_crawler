- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PDF files, which can lead to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious page containing a malicious PDF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file or a malicious page that will deliver a malicious PDF file, and the victim needs to interact with the crafted malicious content (open the file or visit the page).
