- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Premmerce Redirect Manager plugin for WordPress versions <= 1.0.10 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user with sufficient privileges, would cause the server to perform unwanted actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to unknowingly trigger the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
