The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in idccms V1.35.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing or insufficient CSRF protection mechanism.
- The `keyWord_deal.php` endpoint does not validate the origin of the request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can force an authenticated user to perform unwanted actions, such as adding keywords, which could potentially lead to unauthorized modifications of the application's data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint. This page could be delivered through various means like email or social engineering, tricking a logged-in user to unknowingly trigger the request while they visit the attacker's page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious HTML page.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable application to visit the page.
- The targeted user needs to be logged into the vulnerable application at the time they are tricked into triggering the malicious request.
