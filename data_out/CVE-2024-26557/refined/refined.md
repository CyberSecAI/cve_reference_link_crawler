Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the `type` parameter in `components/market/dialog.php` being displayed directly in the front-end code without proper escaping. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the `type` parameter is vulnerable to injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If a user or administrator accesses a malicious URL containing the injected script, an attacker may be able to obtain the user's cookie.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the `type` parameter. The victim would need to access this malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user (or administrator) into accessing it.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `components/market/dialog.php`, specifically lines 103-122. The `type` parameter is directly used to populate the value of the button label in the HTML code. The attacker uses double quotes to close the existing HTML and inject malicious JavaScript.
