- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper separation of rights to edit device settings and communication relation settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863). The application fails to properly enforce access control, leading to unauthorized access to participant groups.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with the permission to manage devices can gain access to participant groups they are not authorized to access. This could result in unauthorized modification of communication settings and access to sensitive information within the groups.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An authenticated user with device management permissions can exploit this flaw via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid credentials and the permission to manage devices in the affected application.
