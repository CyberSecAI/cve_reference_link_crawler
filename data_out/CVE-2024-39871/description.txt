A vulnerability has been identified in SINEMA Remote Connect Server (All versions < V3.2 SP1). Affected applications do not properly separate the rights to edit device settings and to edit settings for communication relations. This could allow an authenticated attacker with the permission to manage devices to gain access to participant groups that the attacked does not belong to.
