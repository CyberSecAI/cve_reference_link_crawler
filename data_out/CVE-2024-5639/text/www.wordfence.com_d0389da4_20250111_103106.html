### Description

The User Profile Picture plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.1 via the 'rest\_api\_change\_profile\_image' function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to update the profile picture of any user.
