Based on the provided information, this vulnerability is related to **CVE-2024-6187**.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a command injection in the `/view/vpn/autovpn/sub_commit.php` file. The `key` parameter from the `$_REQUEST` is directly concatenated into a variable `$lanfile` and then passed to the `system()` function for execution without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The application is vulnerable to command injection due to the direct use of user-controlled input in a system command.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the input received through the `key` parameter before using it in the `system()` call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised Server:** A successful attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to a full compromise of the server.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information or manipulate the server's data.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the server's availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited using an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/view/vpn/autovpn/sub_commit.php`.
- **`key` Parameter:** The `key` parameter in the POST request contains the malicious command to be executed.
- **`action` Parameter:** The `action` parameter must be set to "delete" to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required to exploit the vulnerability, indicating the exploit can potentially be performed remotely without any prior credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `sub_commit.php` within the specified path.
- The vulnerable parameter is `key` within the `$_REQUEST`.
- The vulnerable code uses the `system()` function to execute commands based on the `key` parameter.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating the injection with a sleep command: `key=\`sleep${IFS}5\`&action=delete`
- The vulnerability affects Ruijie RG-UAC version 1.0.
