Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and filtering of uploaded files in the `change-image.php` file of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation of file type or content. This is a classic CWE-434 vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The web application does not sanitize or filter the image being uploaded.
*   **Missing File Type Validation:** The application doesn't check the file extension or MIME type to ensure that only image files are uploaded.
*   **Content Type Bypass:**  Attackers can bypass content-type checks by modifying the content-type header during the upload process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) and executing them on the server, an attacker can gain complete control of the web server and the application.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** This vulnerability can lead to a breach of data confidentiality, tampering with data integrity, and denial of service due to malicious code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload Form:** The primary attack vector is the file upload form within the `change-image.php` page, where the `image` argument is manipulated.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can intercept and modify the upload request using tools like Burp Suite to upload files with dangerous extensions and content types.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application server to send HTTP requests.
*   **Application Access:** The attacker must have access to the "change-image.php" functionality within the Boat Booking System to use the file upload feature.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests and file upload vulnerabilities to exploit this vulnerability and potentially achieve remote code execution.

**Additional details from the GitHub document:**

*   The GitHub document provides a step-by-step demonstration of the vulnerability using Burp Suite to intercept and modify the upload request.
*   It shows that the application accepts arbitrary file extensions and content types without any checks.

This information is more detailed than what would be found in a typical CVE description, providing a specific vulnerable file (`change-image.php`), the vulnerable functionality (image upload), and a proof of concept for exploitation.
