The provided content is related to CVE-2023-36611.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper authorization within Ovarro TBox RTUs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The system allows low-privilege users to access software security tokens of higher privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with "user" privileges could exploit this vulnerability to access files and resources requiring higher privileges by using the retrieved high-privilege tokens. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and potentially further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Network access to the vulnerable device is required.
-   An attacker must have low privilege access ("user" level).
-   The attacker can then establish an SSH session and provide the high privilege tokens to gain elevated access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the affected TBox RTU.
- Low-level user privileges on the system.
