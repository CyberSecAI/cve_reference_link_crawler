- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error occurs when an affected device inspects certain TCP DNS packets while performing Network Address Translation (NAT).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies within the DNS application layer gateway (ALG) functionality used by NAT in Cisco IOS XE Software. Specifically, a logic error in how the device handles crafted TCP DNS packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could cause the affected device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted IPv4 TCP DNS packets through an affected device configured for NAT and with the DNS ALG for TCP feature enabled. The vulnerability is not exploitable using IPv6 traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted IPv4 TCP DNS packets to a vulnerable device that is performing NAT and has the DNS ALG for TCP enabled. No authentication is required.
