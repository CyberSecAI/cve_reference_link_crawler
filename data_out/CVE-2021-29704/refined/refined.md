Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The IBM Resilient Disaster Recovery (DR) system allows connections over the outdated TLS 1.0 protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of an outdated and insecure protocol (TLS 1.0).
- This protocol is vulnerable to various known attacks and is considered insecure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially eavesdrop on or tamper with communication between the Resilient DR system and clients.
- This could lead to data breaches, manipulation of data, or denial of service.
- The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and data are at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically through man-in-the-middle attacks targeting connections to the DR system.
- An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and server can exploit the use of TLS 1.0

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access is required to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- An attacker needs to be positioned on the network between the DR system and its clients to intercept or modify the TLS 1.0 connection.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the separately licensed DR system component of IBM Resilient OnPrem.
- The fix requires upgrading to v42.0 of IBM Resilient, which disables TLS 1.0 connections to the DR system.
- No workarounds or mitigations are available other than upgrading to the patched version.
