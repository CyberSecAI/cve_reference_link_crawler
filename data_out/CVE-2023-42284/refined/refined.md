Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the Tyk Gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The `api_version` URL parameter in the `/api/errors/count/...` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially extract sensitive information from the database or manipulate data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP request targeting the `/api/errors/count/` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `api_version` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tyk Gateway instance and needs to know the API ID.
- The attacker needs to have a valid cookie.

**Additional Details:**

- The content suggests that the vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, where the attacker cannot directly see the results of the query but can infer them based on the response time or behavior.
- The content also provides a sample SQLMap command for exploitation, including the vulnerable URL and the `api_version` parameter.
- The vulnerability is reported to be fixed in Tyk Gateway version 5.0.7.
- The provided SQLmap command also demonstrates that the database behind the endpoint is Postgresql.
