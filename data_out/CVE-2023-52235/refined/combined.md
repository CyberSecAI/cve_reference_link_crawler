##### Summary by SpaceX/Starlink

This CSRF vulnerability allowed JavaScript on 3rd party websites to reach unauthenticated features (ex: reboot, stow, speedtest) on all generations of Dishy and the Starlink Router when a malicious website is loaded from a device connected via Starlink. Features requiring authentication (ex: changing WiFi passwords, adding a repeater, etc.) were not affected.

This vulnerability was patched in both the Starlink WiFi Router and Dishy in December 2023. Dishy and the router update automatically, so no user action is required.

##### Summary by BoBdoduk

Starlink Dishy (Gen 2) and Starlink Router (Gen 2) are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks.

Therefore, by following a malicious link created by an attacker, a remote attacker can take control of a Starlink device on the local network.
