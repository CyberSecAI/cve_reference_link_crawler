  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Starlink Dishy (Gen 2) and Starlink Router (Gen 2) are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSRF vulnerability through DNS rebinding",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can take control of a Starlink device on the local network. This includes unauthenticated features like reboot, stow, and speedtest.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious link created by the attacker is clicked by the user on a device connected to the Starlink network. This allows JavaScript on third-party websites to interact with the Starlink devices.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a malicious link while the user is connected to the Starlink network."
