| NVD scored it as a critical: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-22217>  Unfortunately, NVD scores almost everything a critical 9.8 anymore (usually against the wishes of the developers and other members of the security. Not to say they should be ignored, but take all of their ratings with a huge dash of salt.

| If this is, indeed, an OOB read, then NVD scored incorrectly in this case. That said, I am not defending NVD as they frequently do not score correctly. That said, I want to point out that one part of CVSS specs says to "Score for the worst". That is one thing that leads to many v2 10 / v3 9.8 scores, especially when a vendor says e.g. "Vulnerability fixed". Without details orgs are forced to score like that, which may be artificially high of course. |
