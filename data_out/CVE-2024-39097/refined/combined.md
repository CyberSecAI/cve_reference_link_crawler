| 검증 로직 우회를 통한 Open Redirect 안녕하세요. 개발중인 SAST 보안 툴을 테스트하다가 취약점을 발견하여 제보드립니다. 조치를 위한 PR을 아래 링크에 작성해두었습니다.   * [fix: Open Redirect 검증 로직 우회 취약점 수정 #583](https://github.com/gnuboard/g6/pull/583)  취약한 Version =< 6.0.4 취약점 설명 미흡한 검증 로직으로 `//`를 사용하여 방어 로직을 우회하여 로그인시 타 웹사이트로 사용자를 redirect시킬수 있음. URL 경우 `//`로 시작할시 도메인으로 인지되기에 이러한 점을 악용하여 취약점을 발생시킬수 있습니다. 해당 취약점은 타 이슈에서도 언급되었듯이 피싱으로 악용될수있습니다. PoC ``` http://127.0.0.1:8000/bbs/login?url=//example.com  ``` 코드 문제점 및 조치 아래와 같이 현재 `//` 사용을 확인하는 검증 로직이 누락되어있습니다.

[**CVE-2024-39097.md**](#file-cve-2024-39097-md)

# CVE-2024-39097: Open Redirect Bypass via `//`

**Discovered by:** letm3through (Ahn TaeGyu)

## Description

There is an Open Redirect vulnerability in Gnuboard v6.0.4 and below via the `url` parameter in login path.

* **Vulnerability Type:** CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
* **CVE Impact Other:** Phishing via URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
* **Attack Type:** Remote

## Affected Product

* **Name of affected Product:** gnuboard 6
* **Affected version**: =< 6.0.4
* **Affected Product Code Base:** Gnuboard version 6.0.4 and below are affected - Fixed in version 6.0.5

## Affected Component

* **Component:** Login Path of Gnuboard 6
* **Affected source code:** [dependencies.py](https://github.com/gnuboard/g6/blob/fcd8dc7c42181fa95c1d64f688f6a720902d473e/lib/dependency/dependencies.py#L259-L270)
* **Issue provided with fix PR:** [gnuboard/g6#582](https://github.com/gnuboard/g6/issues/582)
