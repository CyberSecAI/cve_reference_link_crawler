Here's the information extracted from the provided content regarding CVE-2024-9676:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a symlink traversal issue within the `containers/storage` library. This library is used by Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O to handle container storage. The library reads `/etc/passwd` inside the container but does not validate if it is a symlink, which allows it to read an arbitrary file on the host.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Symlink traversal vulnerability.
- Improper input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) by causing the affected processes to hang, potentially leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) kill. This can be triggered when a malicious container image uses a symlink for /etc/passwd, pointing to a FIFO on the host, and an automatically assigned user namespace.
- In some cases, a small risk of information disclosure might exist via error messages, though only potentially revealing file contents that the user already has access to.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation can occur when running a malicious container image that contains a crafted symlink.
- Requires an automatically assigned user namespace (`--userns=auto`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be able to create and run a malicious container image.
- Needs to control container content.
- The attacker must use a user namespace which is assigned automatically.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and other container tools built with the vulnerable containers/storage library.
- The issue was resolved in multiple advisories by updating the affected packages.
- The vulnerability's severity is rated as "Important" in some advisories and "Moderate" in others, depending on context and affected product.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, with low attack complexity.
