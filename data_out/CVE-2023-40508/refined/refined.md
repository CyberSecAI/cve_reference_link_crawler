{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the `putCanvasDB` method due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal",
    "Arbitrary File Deletion",
    "Insufficient path validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files on the affected system. The deletion happens in the context of SYSTEM, which means the attacker can delete any file the SYSTEM user has access to.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must be able to interact with the application over the network."
