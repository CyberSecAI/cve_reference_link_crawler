Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42142:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how DTLS servers in Contiki-NG's tinyDTLS mishandle the early use of a large epoch number. Specifically, the server incorrectly allows handshakes with decreasing epoch numbers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of exception conditions related to epoch numbers during DTLS handshakes.
- The server does not properly validate or enforce the expected increment of epoch numbers, permitting a lower epoch number after a higher epoch number has been used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting this mishandling, potentially disrupting the availability of the service.
- **False-Positive Packet Drops:** The server may incorrectly drop legitimate packets due to the improper handling of epoch numbers.
- **Potential Code Execution**: While the provided text doesn't offer specifics, it indicates code execution may be possible

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Sending specifically crafted DTLS packets that manipulate epoch numbers

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable DTLS server.
- The attacker needs to understand the DTLS protocol enough to manipulate epoch numbers during handshakes.
- No other special capabilities or privileged access are specified in the provided text

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS up to at least the commit `53a0d97` on the master branch.
- The vulnerability can be reproduced by sending packets to complete two handshakes, where the first handshake uses a larger epoch number than the second.
- This issue is related to a similar issue found in eclipse/tinydtls ([https://github.com/eclipse/tinydtls/issues/13](https://github.com/eclipse/tinydtls/issues/13)).
