### Description

Multiple plugins for WordPress utilizing the XootiX Framework are vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'import\_settings' function in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary options on affected sites. This can be used to enable new user registration and set the default role for new users to Administrator.
