Software release 6.4.2 is available for Enterprise Wi-Fi. 6.4.2 software release contains features, enhancements and bug fixes. Following are the downloads available for software release 6.4.2:

* [Documentation](https://support.cambiumnetworks.com/files/wifi6_docs/)
* [XV2-2\_XV2-2T0\_XV2-2T1\_XE3-4](https://support.cambiumnetworks.com/files/wifi6_xv2_2/)
* [XV3-8\_XE5-8](https://support.cambiumnetworks.com/files/wifi6_xv3_8/)
* [e410\_e510\_e430\_e600\_e700](https://support.cambiumnetworks.com/files/e410/)
* [Antenna Patterns](https://support.cambiumnetworks.com/files/wifi6_antenna/)

# New Features

## Auto-RF

With the Auto-RF feature, AP collects a number of RF-statistics and uses that information to give a better Radio Frequency (RF) environment to wireless clients, by selecting the right channel and Tx power for each radio. This results in a better end-user experience in terms of application performance and call quality.

Auto-RF consists of two functionalities:

* Dynamic channel: Helps radios to always select a better channel at boot time and post boot if channel conditions change later.
* Auto power: Helps radios to come up with the right Tx power to handle coverage holes and minimize RF interference.

## Device class filter

This feature applies wireless policies to the client-based device class (notebook, phone, tablet, and laptop) and its type (Windows, Mac, and Android).

## Flooding attacks in Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS)

The WIDS feature is used to detect different types of flood attacks. A flood attack occurs when a rogue client sends a huge number of packets of a specific type to the AP to disrupt the normal working of the AP. This feature can detect the following types of flood attacks:

* Association
* Authentication
* Disassociation
* De-authentication
* Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPoL)

## Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE)

OWE is a Wi-Fi standard, which ensures that the communication between each pair of endpoints is protected from other endpoints. The OWE transition mode allows OWE-capable STAs to access the network in OWE authentication mode.

# Enhancements

## Scale Limit: 2K ePSK

From System Release 6.4.2 onwards, Enterprise Wi-Fi 6 XV series Access Points support 2K ePSK entries per WLAN. Other Access Points (e410, e430, e510, e600, and e700) continue to support 1024 ePSK entries per WLAN.

Hi. I’m running 6.4.2.1-r1 on a XE3-4 and have one iot device that couldn’t stay connected. It was connecting and disconnecting every second. So after some testing I found out that “ Proxy ARP” setting under Configure → WLAN was the problem. I disabled this and now it’s stable and working. So if anyone else is experiencing a similar issue maybe this solves it.

Edit: I’m using Device Login management (Local).
