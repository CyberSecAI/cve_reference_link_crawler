## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Photo Gallery by 10Web <= 1.8.27 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitise and escape some of its Gallery settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

As admin, create/edit a gallery, add/edit an image, set the following payload in the "Alt/Title" field and save: &lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)&gt;
The XSS will be triggered in page/post where the Gallery is embed, or by previewing it

### Affects Plugins
