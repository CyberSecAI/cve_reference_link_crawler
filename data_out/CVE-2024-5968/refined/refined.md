- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its Gallery settings, specifically the "Alt/Title" field when adding/editing an image within a gallery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser when they view a page or post where the affected gallery is embedded or previewed. This could lead to various malicious actions like stealing session cookies, redirecting users to phishing sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to create or edit a gallery and add/edit an image, and inject the malicious code into the "Alt/Title" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have admin-level access within the WordPress site. The attack can be triggered by any user viewing a page/post where the gallery is embedded or by previewing it.
