- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not correctly escape the `order` and `orderby` parameters in the `ajax_fetch_report_list` action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL injection vulnerability. The lack of CSRF protection for the vulnerable action allows attackers to trick logged-in users to perform the action via a link.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform blind SQL injection to potentially extract sensitive data from the database, in this case, user emails are mentioned in the PoC.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the vulnerable `action` and maliciously crafted `order` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have subscriber level access. They can also trick any logged-in user into performing the vulnerable action by having them click a link due to the lack of CSRF protection.
