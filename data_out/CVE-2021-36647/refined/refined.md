Based on the provided content, there is no mention of CVE-2021-36647. However, multiple other CVEs are mentioned, including:

*   **CVE-2024-49195**: A buffer underrun in `mbedtls_pk_write_key_der()` and `mbedtls_pk_write_key_pem()` when called on an opaque key with specific configurations and buffer sizes.
    *   **Root cause:** Insufficient buffer size check in key writing functions with specific conditions.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Buffer underrun.
    *  **Impact of exploitation:** Potential memory corruption, leading to denial of service or other undefined behavior
    *   **Attack vectors:** Calling `mbedtls_pk_write_key_der()` or  `mbedtls_pk_write_key_pem()` with a crafted opaque key and insufficient buffer size.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control the input key and buffer size when calling the vulnerable functions

*   **CVE-2024-45157**: Incorrect usage of `HMAC_DRBG` in PSA subsystem.
    *   **Root cause:**  The PSA subsystem doesn't use `HMAC_DRBG` as expected, but rather relies on `CTR_DRBG` when  `MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG` and `MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C` are disabled.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Misconfiguration leading to unexpected random number generator usage.
    *   **Impact of exploitation**: Could potentially weaken the security of the random number generation.
    *   **Attack vectors**: By disabling `MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG` and `MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C`, the application unintentionally uses a different random number generator than expected, which might have security implications.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control the MbedTLS build configuration.

*   **CVE-2024-45158**: Stack buffer overflow in `mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw()` and `mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der()` functions.
    *   **Root cause:** Insufficient check for the bits parameter against the largest supported curve.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Stack buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact of exploitation**:  Potentially leads to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Attack vectors**:  Calling the vulnerable functions with a large `bits` parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control the `bits` parameter in calls to `mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw()` or `mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der()`.

*   **CVE-2024-45159**: Authentication bypass in TLS 1.3 optional client authentication.
    *   **Root cause**: Incorrect verification of keyUsage/extKeyUsage extensions when client authentication is optional.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Authentication bypass.
    *   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a certificate valid for other uses can authenticate as a TLS client.
    *   **Attack vectors**: Presenting a certificate lacking the appropriate `keyUsage` or `extKeyUsage` extensions during TLS 1.3 handshake with optional client authentication enabled.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a certificate valid for other uses and the ability to connect to a TLS 1.3 server with optional client authentication enabled.

*  **CVE-2024-28960**:  Vulnerability in PSA Crypto API when parameters are in shared memory.
    * **Root Cause:** The PSA core does not protect against modification of inputs or exposure of intermediate outputs when parameters are stored in shared memory.
    * **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Information disclosure, data modification.
    * **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially modify inputs or expose intermediate outputs by manipulating memory.
    * **Attack vectors**: Using parameters from shared memory with PSA crypto functions.
    * **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the shared memory.
