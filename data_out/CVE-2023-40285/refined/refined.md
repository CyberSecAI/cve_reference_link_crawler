{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the web server component of the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) IPMI firmware, specifically due to insufficient input validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Insecure handling of browser cookies and local storage"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could send a phishing link to trick BMC administrators into clicking while they are logged in. This allows the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the administrator's session. The malicious script poisons the admin's browser cookies and/or local storage to create a new user, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted phishing link sent to a logged-in BMC administrator.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create and send phishing links, and the victim must be a logged-in administrator of the BMC web interface and click on the link.",
    "affected_products": "Supermicro BMC in select X11, H11, B11, CMM, M11, and H12 motherboards."
