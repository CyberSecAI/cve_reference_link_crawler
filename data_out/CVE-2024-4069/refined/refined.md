Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `txtSearch` parameter in the `search.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to the leakage of sensitive user data or system information.
*   **Compromised System Security:**  The attacker could compromise the system's security, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is the `txtSearch` parameter within the `search.php` file, which is likely part of a web request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application, specifically targeting the `search.php` page.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `txtSearch` parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided payload is: `txtSearch=0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate()%2Csleep(2)%2C0))XOR'Z`
    * This payload uses SQL injection to introduce a time-based blind SQLi. It attempts to make the database sleep for 2 seconds if the current time equals the system time. This is a common technique to test for SQL injection without retrieving any data directly.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability exists in "kashipara Online Furniture Shopping Ecommerce Website Project" version 1.0 or earlier.
* The vulnerability was submitted to VulDB by user SSL_Seven_Security Lab_WangZhiQiang_XiaoZiLong
* The github link provided in the VulDB submission points to a PDF file named `Online Furniture Shopping Ecommerce Website Project - vuln 1.pdf`.
