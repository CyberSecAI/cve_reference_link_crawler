  "CVE-2020-15778": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2020-15778",
      "Description": "scp in OpenSSH through 8.3p1 allows command injection in the scp.c toremote function, as demonstrated by backtick characters in the destination argument.",
      "Source": "Multiple sources"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root Cause": "The `scp` command does not properly sanitize the destination file name, allowing an attacker to inject shell commands via backticks.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Command Injection/Eval injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the remote server with the privileges of the user specified in the scp command.",
      "Attack Vectors": "The attacker can achieve command injection by embedding backtick characters within the destination file path argument of the `scp` command.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "Requires valid SSH/SCP credentials to execute the command on the remote server.",
      "Technical Details": [
        "The vulnerability lies in the `toremote` function of `scp.c` in OpenSSH, specifically where the destination path is appended to a local scp command without sanitization.",
          "The local command is constructed using user provided input, and backtick characters are not escaped before local execution. This leads to command injection."
      ],
      "Additional Information": "The maintainers of OpenSSH consider this to be an issue with the design of the `scp` protocol (derived from `rcp`), that attempts to 'detect' and 'prevent' anomalous argument transfers stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows. They recommend using `sftp` or `rsync` instead."
