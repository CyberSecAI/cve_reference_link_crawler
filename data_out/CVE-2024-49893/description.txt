In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check stream_status before it is used

[WHAT & HOW]
dc_state_get_stream_status can return null, and therefore null must be
checked before stream_status is used.

This fixes 1 NULL_RETURNS issue reported by Coverity.
