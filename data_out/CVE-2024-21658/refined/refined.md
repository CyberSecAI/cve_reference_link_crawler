- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The limit on the length of the region value is too generous.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient control of the length of the region value. This can lead to excessive bandwidth and disk space usage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can cause a Discourse instance to use excessive bandwidth and disk space. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition by exhausting resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires low privileges to exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction is required.
