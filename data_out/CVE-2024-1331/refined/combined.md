## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Team Members < 5.3.2 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its Team options attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the related shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the author role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create/edit a team and add a member to it
2. Fill all the forms, upload a photo and input `" onmouseover='alert(1)'` in the "First name ", "Lastname" or "Link URL" field.
3. Put the resulting shortcode in a post, render the post and hover the user card / social link icon to trigger the XSS
