- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to validate and escape Team options attributes (specifically, first name, last name, and link URL) before outputting them in a page or post where the related shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which will be executed when a user views the affected page/post. This can lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, and stealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into team member fields (first name, last name, or link URL) through the plugin's interface. The malicious script is then stored in the database and outputted when the shortcode is rendered in a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least author-level privileges to create or edit team members and insert the malicious script into the fields. They also need the ability to create or edit posts/pages to insert the shortcode.
