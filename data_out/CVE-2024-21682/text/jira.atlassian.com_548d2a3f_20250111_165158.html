### Description

This High severity Injection vulnerability was introduced in Assets Discovery 1.0 - 6.2.0 (all versions).

### What is Assets Discovery

Assets Discovery, which can be downloaded via Atlassian Marketplace, is a network scanning tool that can be used with or without an agent with Jira Service Management Cloud, Data Center or Server. It detects hardware and software that is connected to your local network and extracts detailed information about each asset. This data can then be imported into Assets in Jira Service Management to help you manage all of the devices and configuration items within your local network.

### Affected Versions

This vulnerability affects all versions prior to Assets Discovery **6.2.0 Data Center and server** Atlassian recommends patching to the latest version.

| **Product** | **Component** | **Affected Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jira Service Management Data Center and Server | Assets Discovery | * Assets Discovery 6.0.0 - 6.2.0, 6.2.0-jira-dc-8 * All previous versions |

### Fixed Versions

*![](/images/icons/emoticons/information.png) There is no need to upgrade Jira Service Management product, only the Assets Discovery application and agents.*

| **Product** | **Component** | **Fixed Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jira Service Management Data Center and Server | Assets Discovery | * Assets Discovery **6.2.1** or later |
