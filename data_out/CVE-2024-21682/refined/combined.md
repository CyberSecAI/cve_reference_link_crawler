## Discovery Tool updates in Assets Discovery 3.2.1-Cloud/6.2.1-Data\_Center

### Easily update Discovery Agents

You can now quickly get the latest version of Assets Discovery and upgrade directly from Discovery Agent instead of a manual update from the Atlassian Marketplace.

Run Agent with the -`update` parameter (`Discovery_Agent.exe -update`) and if a newer version is available, wait for the automatic update to complete.

### New configuration options for SNMP patterns

We’ve added new configuration options for `SNMPProvider` so you can receive data in different formats. You can now set the following properties:

* `OctetStringAsHex`  to true and receive OctetString OIDs in HEX format.
* `OctetStringEncoding` to Encoding.ASCII, Encoding.UTF8, Encoding.Unicode, or Encoding.UTF32 to configure the encoding of the OctetString you receive.

### New Agent network interface settings

Additional settings now available in Discovery Agent so you can configure the network interface communication.

* To configure the Agent to listen to any active network interface, set `UseAllNetworkInterfaces` to true.
* To configure the Agent to listen to matching IPv4/IPv6 network masks, set a value for `UseIPMatching` . For example, “192.168.5.85/24“ “2001:db8:abcd:0012::0/64“

Note that by default, the Agent listens on the first active IPv4 network interface. If you configure both the above settings, the Agent only uses the `UseAllNetworkInterfaces` setting.

With this change, we’ve also removed the `JustUseFirstIP` configuration.

# February 2024 Security Bulletin

This bulletin addresses vulnerabilities that have been resolved in Atlassian self-managed products.

The vulnerabilities reported in this security bulletin include 11 high-severity vulnerabilities which have been fixed in new versions of our products, released in the last month. These vulnerabilities are discovered via our Bug Bounty program, pen-testing processes, and third-party library scans.

To fix all the vulnerabilities impacting your product(s), Atlassian recommends patching your instances to the latest version or one of the Fixed Versions for each product below. The listed Fixed Versions for each product are current as of Feb. 20, 2024 (date of publication); visit the linked product Release Notes for the most up-to-date versions.

**NOTE**: The vulnerabilities included in monthly Security Bulletins present a lower impact than those published via Critical Security Advisories. Customers can expect to receive those high-priority patches outside of our monthly schedule as necessary.

### Description

This High severity Injection vulnerability was introduced in Assets Discovery 1.0 - 6.2.0 (all versions).

### What is Assets Discovery

Assets Discovery, which can be downloaded via Atlassian Marketplace, is a network scanning tool that can be used with or without an agent with Jira Service Management Cloud, Data Center or Server. It detects hardware and software that is connected to your local network and extracts detailed information about each asset. This data can then be imported into Assets in Jira Service Management to help you manage all of the devices and configuration items within your local network.

### Affected Versions

This vulnerability affects all versions prior to Assets Discovery **6.2.0 Data Center and server** Atlassian recommends patching to the latest version.

| **Product** | **Component** | **Affected Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jira Service Management Data Center and Server | Assets Discovery | * Assets Discovery 6.0.0 - 6.2.0, 6.2.0-jira-dc-8 * All previous versions |

### Fixed Versions

*![](/images/icons/emoticons/information.png) There is no need to upgrade Jira Service Management product, only the Assets Discovery application and agents.*

| **Product** | **Component** | **Fixed Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jira Service Management Data Center and Server | Assets Discovery | * Assets Discovery **6.2.1** or later |

### Recommendation

This Injection vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 7.2, allows an authenticated attacker to modify the actions taken by a system call which has high impact to confidentiality, high impact to integrity, high impact to availability, and requires no user interaction.

Atlassian recommends that Assets Discovery customers upgrade to latest version, if you are unable to do so, upgrade your instance to one of the specified supported fixed versions

See the release notes (<https://confluence.atlassian.com/assetapps/assets-discovery-3-2-1-cloud-6-2-1-data_center-1333987182.html>). You can download the latest version of Assets Discovery from the Atlassian Marketplace (<https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214668/assets-discovery?hosting=datacenter&tab=installation>).

This vulnerability was reported via our Penetration Testing program.
