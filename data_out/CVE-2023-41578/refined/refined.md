The provided content describes a vulnerability in Jeecg-boot version 3.5.3 and earlier, specifically an arbitrary file read vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `/testConnection` route which allows a user to construct a MySQL connection.  The application attempts to prevent `allowLoadLocalInfile` by replacing `allowLoadLocalInfile=true` with `allowLoadLocalInfile=false`. However, this can be bypassed. By setting the `dbUsername` parameter to `fileread_/etc/passwd`, and by providing `allowLoadLocalInfile=yes` in the `dbUrl`, the attacker can leverage MySQL's `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation on the `dbUsername` parameter.
- Inadequate sanitization of the `dbUrl`, allowing bypass of the `allowLoadLocalInfile` protection.
- Direct usage of user-controlled input in the `DriverManager.getConnection` method.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure such as credentials, configuration files, and source code, which can be used for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/testConnection` endpoint with the malicious `dbUsername` and `dbUrl` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerable code block is:
```java
@PostMapping({"/testConnection"})
public Result a(@RequestBody JmreportDynamicDataSourceVo var1) {
    // ...
    try {
        // ...
        Class.forName(var1.getDbDriver());
        DriverManager.setLoginTimeout(60);
        String var38 = org.jeecg.modules.jmreport.dyndb.util.b.g(var1.getDbUrl());
        var2 = DriverManager.getConnection(var38, var1.getDbUsername(), var1.getDbPassword());
    // ...
}
```

The `org.jeecg.modules.jmreport.dyndb.util.b.g` method attempts to prevent the use of `allowLoadLocalInfile` as follows:
```java
public static String g(String var0) {
    if (a(var0, "mysql")) {
        if (var0.indexOf("allowLoadLocalInfile") > 0) {
            var0 = var0.replaceAll("(?i)allowLoadLocalInfile=true", "allowLoadLocalInfile=false");
        } else {
            var0 = var0 + "&allowLoadLocalInfile=false";
        }
    }
    return var0;
}
```

The bypass is achieved by including `allowLoadLocalInfile=yes` and setting the username to `fileread_/etc/passwd`.
