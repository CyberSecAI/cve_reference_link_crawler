The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, which highlights changes made to address a SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The original code in `ReviewServiceImpl.java` used string concatenation to build a SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `getByMovieIdAndUsername` method concatenated the `movieId` and `username` parameters directly into the query string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The direct use of string concatenation to build the SQL query allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `username` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even compromise the entire database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `username` parameter in the `getByMovieIdAndUsername` method is the primary attack vector. By injecting malicious SQL code in the `username` field, an attacker could manipulate the generated SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a request to the `getByMovieIdAndUsername` method with a crafted `username` value that includes malicious SQL code. This likely requires the ability to interact with the application's API or user interface.

**Code Changes:**
The commit replaces the vulnerable string concatenation with parameterized queries using `Expr.eq`.
Specifically, this line:
```java
return find.where("movieId = " + movieId + " and username = '" + username + "'").findUnique();
```
is replaced with:
```java
return find.where().and(Expr.eq("movieId", movieId), Expr.eq("username", username)).findUnique();
```
This change uses the `Expr.eq` method to safely add the parameters to the query, preventing SQL injection.

The changes to `WebplayerController.java` are not related to the security vulnerability, rather they change the annotations used to implement authorization to the webplayer.
