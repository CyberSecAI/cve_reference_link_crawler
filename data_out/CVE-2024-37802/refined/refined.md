The provided content relates to CVE-2024-37802.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `searvalu` parameter within the "Patient Info" module of the Health Care hospital Management System. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Compromise of the application:** Attackers can compromise the application by exploiting the SQL injection.
- **Access or modification of data:**  Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database to view, modify, or delete sensitive information.
- **Exploiting further vulnerabilities:** The attacker can potentially leverage the initial access to exploit additional vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed through an HTTP POST request to the `/HMS/petsearch.php` endpoint.
- **`searvalu` parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is injected via the `searvalu` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication:** While the description states "Authenticated", the provided exploit does not seem to require prior authentication. The vulnerability lies in the search functionality which appears to be accessible post login to the system as a regular user.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter, which in this case, is `searvalu`.
- **Knowledge of SQL injection:**  The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
