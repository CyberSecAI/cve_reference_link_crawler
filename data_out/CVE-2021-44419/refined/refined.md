- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` process, which manages API requests, incorrectly assumes that the JSON "param" element is always a JSON object. When a non-object value (e.g., a string like "") is provided, the code attempts to access it as an object using the subscription operator, triggering an assertion failure that kills the process and reboots the device. This occurs in various API-specific parameter parsers due to the shared code used to access the "param" element before passing it to the API specific parser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) - The application does not properly validate the type of the JSON "param" element before accessing it. This leads to an assertion failure, which crashes the process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service - Successful exploitation leads to the `cgiserver.cgi` process being killed and the device rebooting. This makes the device temporarily unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON body to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint of the device. The JSON body contains a command with an action and a "param" element set to a non-object value such as "".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device. Although some API calls require a logged-in user, this can be bypassed via TALOS-2021-1420 which allows API calls without authentication.
