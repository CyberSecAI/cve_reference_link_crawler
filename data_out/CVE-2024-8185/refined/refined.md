- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from excessive resource consumption during the Raft cluster join process. When a node joins a Vault cluster using Integrated Storage, it requires a cryptographic operation for each join request. By sending a large volume of these requests, an attacker can force Vault to consume excessive system memory.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper resource management during the cryptographic operations involved in the Raft cluster join process. The system does not properly limit the number of join requests or the amount of memory consumed by these operations, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The excessive memory consumption can crash the underlying system and the Vault process itself, making Vault unavailable.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the Raft cluster join API endpoint. An attacker sends numerous join requests to this endpoint, each triggering memory-intensive cryptographic operations.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the Vault cluster's API endpoint to send the malicious join requests. There is no indication that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any special privileges other than network access.
