Based on the provided content, all three commits address the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing null check on the return value of `devm_kstrdup()` within the `fmt_single_name()` function in `sound/soc/soc-core.c`. If `devm_kstrdup()` fails to allocate memory, it returns NULL, which is then dereferenced, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A null pointer dereference can cause a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `fmt_single_name()` is called in a situation where memory allocation fails through `devm_kstrdup()`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to trigger the `fmt_single_name()` function in a scenario where `devm_kstrdup()` fails, which usually indicates a low memory condition. This suggests the attacker would require some ability to manipulate system resources or place the system under memory pressure.
