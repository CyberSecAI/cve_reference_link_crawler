The provided content is a webpage from a GitHub repository, specifically a file named "CVE-2023-41635 | RealGimm - XML External Entity Injection.md". The title of the file suggests that this is a proof-of-concept or explanation of a vulnerability related to CVE-2023-41635 involving XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

However, the actual content of the page is just the standard Github page framework - navigation menu, footer etc. It does not contain any details of the vulnerability itself.

Therefore, despite the filename suggesting a PoC for CVE-2023-41635, the document does not contain relevant information to extract about the CVE itself.
