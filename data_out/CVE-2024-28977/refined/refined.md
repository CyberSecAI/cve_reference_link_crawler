**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-28977

**Vulnerability Description:**
- The vulnerability is a Path Traversal issue within the logger module of Dell Repository Manager versions 3.4.2 through 3.4.4.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the logger module handles file paths, allowing for traversal outside of the intended directory.

- **Low Confidentiality Impact**: The impact is limited to reading, not modification or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system where Dell Repository Manager is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges on the local system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- Dell Repository Manager versions 3.4.2 through 3.4.4

**Remediation:**
- Upgrade to Dell Repository Manager version 3.4.5

**Workaround:**
