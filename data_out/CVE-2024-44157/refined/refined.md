- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unexpected system termination.
- **Attack vectors**: Parsing a maliciously crafted video file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malicious video file to be parsed by the vulnerable software.
