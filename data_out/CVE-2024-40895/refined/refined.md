Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection flaw in the FFRI AMC software. This occurs when the "notification program setting" is enabled, and the "executable file path" is configured to use a batch file (.bat) or command file (.cmd), and the file is written in a certain style.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server running the vulnerable FFRI AMC instance. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending crafted requests to the FFRI AMC server, impersonating a legitimate yarai client.
* The communication between FFRI yarai and FFRI AMC can be intercepted and modified by an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network access to the FFRI AMC server.
*   **Impersonation:** Attackers need to be able to craft requests that appear to come from a legitimate yarai client.
*   **Vulnerable Configuration:** The "notification program setting" needs to be enabled and configured to use `.bat` or `.cmd` files as the executable file path.

**Affected Products:**

*   **FFRI AMC:** Versions 3.4.0 to 3.5.3
*   **NEC's FFRI AMC for ActSecure Ï‡:** Versions 3.4.0 to 3.5.3
*   **Sky's EDR Plus Pack (Bundled FFRI AMC):** Versions 3.4.0 to 3.5.3

**Mitigation:**

*   **Software Update:** The primary mitigation is to update FFRI AMC to the patched version 3.6.1 or later provided by the respective vendors.
*   **Disable Notification Program Setting:** As a temporary workaround, the "notification program setting" can be disabled.
*   **Change Executable File Extension:** If notification programs are needed, do not use `.bat` or `.cmd` file extensions.
*  **Restrict Access:** Limit access to FFRI AMC from untrusted networks or devices.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by FFRI Security.
*   The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 8.1, indicating a high severity.
*   FFRI yarai Cloud, FFRI yarai, and FFRI yarai Home and Business Edition are not affected.
