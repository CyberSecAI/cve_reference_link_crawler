Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file type validation in the `startklarDropZoneUploadProcess.php` file, specifically within the `process` function. The plugin does not properly validate the file type before saving the file on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows users to upload files without properly checking their types or content.
- **Insufficient sanitization:** The code used `sanitize_text_field` where `sanitize_file_name` or `wp_check_filetype` should have been used for file uploads.
- **Missing file type validation:** The code does not validate the uploaded file extension or MIME type before saving it to the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload any type of file to the server, including executable files.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker uploads a malicious PHP file, they can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Data theft or manipulation:** Attackers can potentially upload scripts to steal sensitive data or manipulate the website content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via an HTTP request to the `startklarDropZoneUploadProcess.php` file. The plugin uses the `$_FILES` and `$_POST` variables to handle the uploaded files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have any user account or login credentials on the WordPress site, thus making it easily exploitable.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `startklarDropZoneUploadProcess.php` file and the required parameters for file uploads.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.14 of the plugin.
- The fix includes sanitizing the file name and validating the file type before saving the file to the server.

The patch implemented in version 1.7.14 includes:
- Replacing `sanitize_text_field` with `sanitize_key` followed by `sanitize_text_field` for the hash parameter
- Replacing `sanitize_text_field` with `sanitize_file_name` for the file name parameter
- Adding `wp_check_filetype` to validate the uploaded file type
