Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within multiple widgets of the Piotnet Addons For Elementor plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input when processing various widget attributes, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. This code will execute whenever a user accesses the page containing the injected content.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:**  The executed scripts can potentially perform various malicious actions including:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    - Defacing website content.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Widgets:** The vulnerability is present in multiple widgets of the Piotnet Addons For Elementor plugin.
- **User Supplied Attributes:**  Attackers can inject malicious code through various widget attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to utilize the vulnerable plugin.
- **Knowledge of Plugin:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the plugin functions and how to inject malicious code.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in plugin versions up to and including 2.4.28
- The fix involves sanitizing user input using functions like `esc_html`, `wp_kses_post`, and `esc_attr` when processing user-supplied data before displaying it in the output
- The vulnerable code locations are within multiple widget files, such as pafe-tooltip.php, pafe-before-after-image-comparison-slider.php, pafe-countdown-cart.php, pafe-dual-color-headline.php, pafe-hotspot.php, pafe-image-accordion.php, pafe-posts-list.php, pafe-product-tabs.php, pafe-progressbar.php, pafe-sales-pop.php, pafe-switch-content.php, pafe-table.php, pafe-vertical-timeline.php, and pafe-video-playlist.php
