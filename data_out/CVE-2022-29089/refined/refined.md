Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-29089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in Dell SmartFabric OS10 versions before October 2021 when SmartFabric Services is enabled.
- It is due to an information disclosure flaw in the Networking OS10.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure vulnerability.
- Potential to access the REST API with administrative privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially:
    - Retrieve sensitive information via reverse engineering.
    - Gain unauthorized access to the REST API with admin privileges.
    - Compromise the affected system.
- This can lead to a low impact on confidentiality and integrity, and high impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack over the network.
- Requires adjacent network access (AV:A).
- No user interaction (UI:N) is needed for exploitation.
- No specific privileges (PR:N) are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to the affected system.
- The attacker is unauthenticated, meaning they do not need any valid credentials.
- Reverse engineering skills are required to exploit this vulnerability.
