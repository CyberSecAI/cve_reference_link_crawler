Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3644:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

   - The provided content includes CVE-2017-3644 in the risk matrix for "Oracle MySQL" and also in the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2017:2886.
   - The description in the advisory explicitly mentions "CVE-2017-3644 mysql: Server: DML unspecified vulnerability (CPU Jul 2017)".
   - This confirms that the content is directly related to CVE-2017-3644.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

   - **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability is described as a "Server: DML unspecified vulnerability." This means that the vulnerability is located in the Data Manipulation Language (DML) processing within the MySQL server. DML is used to query and modify data. The specific weakness is not detailed in the text, but it is related to how the server processes DML queries or operations.

    - **Weakness:** The specific weakness in the DML processing is not described, but the generic nature of the advisory suggests that there might be several potential issues like improper input validation or flaws in memory handling within the DML operations.

   - **Impact:** 
        - According to the Oracle risk matrix, the impact is limited to availability.
        - Red Hat Advisory indicates the vulnerability, "Server: DML unspecified vulnerability (CPU Jul 2017)", could lead to a crash. 

   - **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the "MySQL Protocol". This implies the attacker needs to communicate with the vulnerable MySQL server using the standard MySQL protocol, meaning the attack can originate from any host that can reach the MySQL port.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        -  An attacker needs network access to the MySQL port. 
        -  No authentication is needed, according to the oracle matrix, as the Remote Exploit without Auth column is marked as "No."
        - The CVSS base score is 4.9, indicating a low level of complexity. This suggests that exploiting this vulnerability does not require sophisticated techniques.

**3. Additional Notes**

    - The Red Hat advisory provides a more specific context that it's a vulnerability in the way the server handles DML operations, indicating the issue might be with parsing, executing or handling specific DML statements, but not the precise vulnerability is specified.
    - Both the Oracle and Red Hat documents suggest applying the latest patches to address this vulnerability.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3644
*   **Root Cause:** Unspecified vulnerability in MySQL Server's DML processing.
*   **Weakness:**  Potentially flawed data manipulation within DML operations, possibly related to improper input validation or memory handling
*   **Impact:** Potential for denial of service (crashing the server).
*  **Attack Vector:** Over the network, using the MySQL protocol.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires network access to the MySQL port. No authentication is required.
