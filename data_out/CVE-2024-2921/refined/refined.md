Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-2921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control in PAM (Privileged Access Management) vault permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insufficient access control mechanisms for PAM vault permissions. This allows unauthorized access to PAM entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated user with access to the PAM can gain access to unauthorized PAM entries.
*   The CVSS score indicates a High impact on confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the PAM.
*   Specific permissions are required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid account on the Devolutions Server.
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated.
*   The attacker must have some existing access to the PAM.
*   They need to know how to craft requests to exploit the improper permission setup to gain access to unauthorized PAM entries.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Devolutions Server 2024.1.6 and earlier.
*   The fix is available in version 2024.1.8 and later.
*   The CVSS score is 5.9 (Medium) which includes a High impact on confidentiality and Low impact on Integrity and Availability.
*   The attack complexity is low, however, it is required that the attacker already has privileges to the PAM section which is why the Privileges Required is High.
