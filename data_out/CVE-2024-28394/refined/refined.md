The provided content is related to CVE-2024-28394.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the "Sales Reports, Statistics, Custom Fields & Export" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `export.php` file uses `Tools::getValue('file')` to retrieve a file path from user input without proper sanitization. The `urldecode` function is applied to the file parameter without any checks or restrictions. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path and potentially access or delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:** The module allows an attacker to control the file name or path used in file operations.
- **Broken Access Control:** Guest users are able to delete arbitrary files.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The file path provided by the user is not properly sanitized before being used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete any files on the server, including critical files such as .htaccess, which can then allow further exploitation.
- **Data Loss:** Deletion of files can lead to data loss and disruption of services.
- **Confidentiality Breach (indirect):** Deleting `.htaccess` files can expose protected directories and sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible via network requests.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `file` parameter in a URL or HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in.
- **Knowledge of module endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL for `export.php` to send their malicious request.
