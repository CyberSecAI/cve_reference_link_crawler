Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Avada WordPress plugin's `fusion_button` shortcode. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly handle user-supplied attributes, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are injected and stored on the server. These scripts are then executed when a user accesses the affected page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-provided input (specifically, attributes within the `fusion_button` shortcode) are not properly sanitized. This allows the inclusion of malicious code within these attributes.
- **Improper Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output of the `fusion_button` shortcode, leading to the execution of the injected malicious code when the page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Account Compromise:** With XSS, attackers could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker could use the injected script to deface the website, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the site.
- **Malware Distribution:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts that can redirect users to sites hosting malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`fusion_button` shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered when using the `fusion_button` shortcode within the Avada plugin.
- **Malicious Event Attributes:** An attacker injects malicious javascript through event attributes (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`, etc.) within the `fusion_button` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level access.
- **Ability to add/edit content:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit pages/posts where the `fusion_button` shortcode can be added.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was partially fixed in version 3.11.9, with additional hardening in version 3.11.10.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Wordfence.
