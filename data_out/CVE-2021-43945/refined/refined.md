- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (SXSS) issue, caused by improper handling of input in the `/rest/jpo/1.0/hierarchyConfiguration` endpoint. Specifically, the `issueTypes` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript in the context of the user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker with Roadmaps Administrator permissions can inject malicious code through the `/rest/jpo/1.0/hierarchyConfiguration` endpoint, specifically the `issueTypes` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Roadmaps Administrator permissions on the affected Jira instance.
