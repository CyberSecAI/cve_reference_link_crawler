- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation of certain IPv4 packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted IPv4 packet either to or through an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be associated with the affected AP.
