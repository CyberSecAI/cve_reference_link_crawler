| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Access Point Software Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-ap-dos-h9TGGX6W  First Published: 2024 March 27 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwh00028](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh00028)     CVE-2024-20271     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20271     CWE-20       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ap-dos-h9TGGX6W/csaf/cisco-sa-ap-dos-h9TGGX6W.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the IP packet processing of Cisco Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain IPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 packet either to or through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need to be associated with the affected AP. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending IPv6 packets.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ap-dos-h9TGGX6W>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable software release:    + 6300 Series Embedded Services APs   + Aironet 1540 Series APs   + Aironet 1560 Series APs   + Aironet 1800 Series APs   + Aironet 2800 Series APs   + Aironet 3800 Series APs   + Aironet 4800 APs   + Business 100 Series APs and Mesh Extenders   + Business 200 Series APs   + Catalyst 9100 APs   + Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series APs   + Integrated APs on 1100 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + Wide Pluggable Form Factor Wi-Fi 6 AP Module for Industrial Routers For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect any Cisco AP series that is not listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp)  section of this advisory.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following tables, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.  The process to upgrade an AP requires upgrading the wireless controller to which the AP is registered. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in this section.  **APs Managed by Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) or Mobility Express (ME)**       | Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 8.9 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 8.10 | 8.10.190.0 |       **APs Managed by Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controller or Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC)**       | Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controller Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 17.2 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.3 | 17.3.8 |   | 17.4 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.5 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.6 | 17.6.6 |   | 17.7 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.8 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.9 | 17.9.5 |   | 17.10 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.11 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.12 | 17.12.2 |   | 17.13 | Not vulnerable. |       **Business 140, 141, 142, 143, 145, and 240 APs and Mesh Extenders**       | Cisco Business Wireless AP Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 10.8.1 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 10.9.1 | 10.9.1.0 |       **Business 150 and 151 APs and Mesh Extenders**       | Cisco Business Wireless AP Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 10.5.2 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 10.6.2 | 10.6.2.0 |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
