Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the usage of the `readfile` function within the Garrett Metal Detectors iC Module CMA software. This function reads data from a specified file into a buffer without any bounds checking, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `readfile` function copies file contents into a fixed-size buffer without checking if the file size exceeds the buffer's capacity. This can overwrite stack data, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Unsafe `readfile` Implementation:** The `readfile` function lacks any validation of the destination buffer, making it vulnerable to buffer overflows if provided with a file that is larger than the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overflowing the stack, an attacker can overwrite the return address, gaining control of the program counter and enabling arbitrary code execution on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CVE-2021-21905:** The vulnerability lies in the `get_ip` function, triggered via the `ipconfig` CLI command. An attacker can exploit this by first setting a long string as the `public_ip` environment variable via the CLI using the `setenv public_ip [value]` command. Subsequently, when the `ipconfig` command is executed, the `get_ip` function attempts to read the attacker controlled `public_ip` environment variable into the buffer on the stack leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **CVE-2021-21906:** This vulnerability is triggered during user authentication using the `checkPassword` function. The password comparison logic uses the `readfile` function to read `/ltrx_user/secret` into a 35-byte buffer. If an attacker can overwrite this file (via another vulnerability), they can place a long string within the secret file, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow when the `checkPassword` function attempts to read the content during user authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated CLI access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the iC Module's command-line interface (CLI) over TCP port 6877 to exploit both vulnerabilities.
*   **For CVE-2021-21905:** The attacker needs the ability to use the `setenv` command to manipulate the `public_ip` environment variable.
*   **For CVE-2021-21906:** The attacker needs to have the ability to alter the contents of `/ltrx_user/secret` (which might require exploiting another vulnerability).

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided report gives an approximate decompilation of relevant functions for clarity.
*   The report includes crash information showing the program counter being overwritten with attacker-controlled values (0x41414140).
*   The report provides a proof-of-concept exploit for both vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Matt Wiseman of Cisco Talos.
*   The vendor patched the vulnerabilities after disclosure.
