Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28153:

**CVE-2024-28153: Stored XSS vulnerability in OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin does not properly escape vulnerability metadata from Dependency-Check reports before displaying it on the Jenkins UI.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin is vulnerable to XSS attacks because it fails to sanitize the vulnerability metadata. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when a user views the report.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a Jenkins user's browser session.
    *   This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of the Jenkins UI.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to control the workspace contents or CVE metadata, which is then processed by the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin. This could involve:
        *   Manipulating dependency data in a project
        *   Modifying CVE metadata within the build environment
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to control the workspace contents or CVE metadata processed by the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin. This suggests they need some level of access to project configurations or build processes within Jenkins.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin versions 5.4.5 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.4.6, which escapes the vulnerability metadata.
