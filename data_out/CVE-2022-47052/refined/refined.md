Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied data, specifically within the handling of non-existent page requests (404 errors). The web interface does not neutralize Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) characters (`\r` and `\n` or their encoded representations such as `%0A` ) within the URL request. This allows an attacker to inject these characters and malicious code into the HTTP response headers and ultimately the response body.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CRLF Injection:** The core weakness is the injection of CRLF characters into the HTTP response headers by manipulating the requested URL.
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting CRLF characters followed by `<script>` tags, the attacker can insert arbitrary JavaScript code into the 404 error page.
- **HTML Injection:** Similarly, the attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the 404 error response body.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user who visits the specially crafted URL.
- **Administrative Actions:** If an administrator opens the malicious URL, an attacker can execute actions within the router's admin panel, such as enabling debugging features or changing settings.
- **Credential Theft:** The attacker can present a fake login prompt to steal the administrator's username and password.
- **Chained Exploits:**  This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities like Remote Command Execution to create a one-click exploit scenario, making the attack more severe.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes CRLF characters and malicious JavaScript/HTML.
- **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to the router.
- The attacker only needs to induce an administrator to visit the crafted URL. This could be achieved via social engineering techniques such as embedding the link into a phishing email, or via a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Additional details:**

*   **Affected Product:** NETGEAR Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router.
*   **Vulnerable Firmware:** Tested on firmware versions V1.1.0.112\_1.0.1 and V1.1.0.114\_1.0.1.
*   The injected payload is executed because the web server includes the injected characters and payload directly into the 404 page response body.
*   The provided example payloads demonstrate how the vulnerability can be exploited to enable a debug telnet interface and perform phishing attacks.
*   The provided evidence includes the full request and response headers and response body.
