Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** SQL injection

**Root Cause:** The `RUN_ID` parameter in the `delete_data_attach.php` file is not properly processed, allowing for SQL injection.

**Affected Software:** Beijing Tongda Xinke Technology Co., Ltd Tongda OA v2017-v11.10

**Vulnerable File:** `general/approve_center/query/list/input_form/delete_data_attach.php`

**Attack Vector:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the vulnerable file with a malicious `RUN_ID` parameter.
- Example URL with malicious SQL injection payload: `/general/approve_center/query/list/input_form/delete_data_attach.php?RUN_ID=1%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),1,1))=char(116)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B)`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (e.g., reading sensitive database information, including database name and schema)
    - Data modification (e.g., adding, deleting, or modifying entries in the database)
    - Potential compromise of the application and the server hosting the database.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a prerequisite to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub issue includes several examples of SQL injection payloads targeting the `DATABASE()` function.
- The attacker is using techniques like `substr()` to extract the database name character by character.
- The exploit attempts to use `information_schema.columns` as a means of exfiltration
- The content from vuldb.com confirms that the issue has been accepted as valid.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported on October 29, 2024, and it was accepted on October 31, 2024.
