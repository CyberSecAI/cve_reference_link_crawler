  "CVE-2023-40167": {
    "description": "Jetty accepts the '+' character proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is more permissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with 400 responses. There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400 response.",
    "root_cause": "Jetty's HTTP parser is more permissive than RFC 9110 and accepts '+' prefixed values in the Content-Length header, which is not standard.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-130"
    ],
    "impact": "Request smuggling could result if Jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending a 400 response",
