# Jetty accepts "+" prefixed value in Content-Length

Moderate

GHSA-hmr7-m48g-48f6
Sep 14, 2023

## Package

maven

org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 9.0.0, <= 9.4.51
>= 10.0.0, <= 10.0.15
>= 11.0.0, <= 11.0.15
<= 12.0.0

## Patched versions

9.4.52
10.0.16
11.0.16
12.0.1

## Description

### Impact

Jetty accepts the '+' character proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is more permissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with 400 responses. There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400 response.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround as there is no known exploit scenario.

### Original Report

[RFC 9110 Secion 8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6) defined the value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits. However we found that Jetty accepts "+" prefixed Content-Length, which could lead to potential HTTP request smuggling.

Payload:

```
 POST / HTTP/1.1
 Host: a.com
 Content-Length: +16
 Connection: close
 ​
 0123456789abcdef

```

When sending this payload to Jetty, it can successfully parse and identify the length.

When sending this payload to NGINX, Apache HTTPd or other HTTP servers/parsers, they will return 400 bad request.

This behavior can lead to HTTP request smuggling and can be leveraged to bypass WAF or IDS.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
