# Account compromise by man-in-the-middle attack

## Package

ScratchOAuth2
(MediaWiki extension)

## Affected versions

<9220c2a

## Patched versions

>=9220c2a

## Description

### Impact

Any ScratchOAuth2-related data normally accessible and modifiable by a user can be read and modified by a third party.

1. Scratch user visits 3rd party site
2. 3rd party site asks user for Scratch username
3. 3rd party site pretends to be user and gets login code from ScratchOAuth2
4. 3rd party site gives code to user and instructs them to post it on their profile
5. User posts code on their profile, not knowing it is a ScratchOAuth2 login code
6. 3rd party site completes login with ScratchOAuth2
7. 3rd party site has full access to anything the user could do if they directly logged in

### Patches

Warning included in code itself to only trust codes from the right site. (Commit [9220c2a](https://github.com/ScratchVerifier/ScratchOAuth2/commit/9220c2a77eda3df37a84486ad722f1ad0985d8e7))

### Workarounds

Do not trust login codes that perfectly match the original ScratchOAuth2 format (`fivec:harac:tersc:olons:epara:ted...`).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
