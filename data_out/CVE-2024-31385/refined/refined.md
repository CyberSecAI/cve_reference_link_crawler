- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ReDi Restaurant Reservation plugin for WordPress lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation is performed through a crafted malicious request initiated from an external website or platform.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link, and the attacker does not need to have any user privileges on the WordPress site itself.
