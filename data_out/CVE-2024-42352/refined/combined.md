# SSRF

High

GHSA-cxgv-px37-4mp2

## Package

npm

@nuxt/icon
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 1.4.4

## Patched versions

>= 1.4.5

## Description

### Summary

`nuxt/icon` provides an API to allow client side icon lookup. This endpoint is at `/api/_nuxt_icon/[name]`.

The proxied request path is improperly parsed, allowing an attacker to change the scheme and host of the request. This leads to SSRF, and could potentially lead to sensitive data exposure.

### Details

The `new URL` constructor is used to parse the final path. This constructor can be passed a relative scheme or path in order to change the host the request is sent to. This constructor is also very tolerant of poorly formatted URLs.

As a result we can pass a path prefixed with the string `http:`. This has the effect of changing the scheme to HTTP. We can then subsequently pass a new host, for example `http:127.0.0.1:8080`. This would allow us to send requests to a local server.

### PoC

Make a request to `/api/_nuxt_icon/http:example.com`, observe the data returned has been fetched from a different resource than intended.

I typically try to find an example within Nuxt infrastructure that is vulnerable to these types of bugs, but I could not identify any with this endpoint enabled.

### Impact

* SSRF, potential sensitive data exposure.
* I do not believe this can be chained into an XSS, but it may be possible.
* Does not have a security impact on services deployed on Cloudflare Workers.
* Does not impact certain builds and modes (like static builds).
* Can be mitigated using by disabling the `fallbackToApi` option.

### Fix

* Ensure the host has not been changed after the path is parsed.
* Alternatively, prefix the path with `./`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
