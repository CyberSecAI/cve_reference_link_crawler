The C:\Windows\Temp\Agent.Package.Availability\Agent.Package.Availability.exe file is automatically launched as SYSTEM when the system reboots. Since the C:\Windows\Temp\Agent.Package.Availability folder inherits permissions from C:\Windows\Temp and Agent.Package.Availability.exe is susceptible to DLL hijacking, standard users can write a malicious DLL to it and elevate their privileges.
