### Description

The Ivory Search – WordPress Search Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax\_create\_index() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.5.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to trigger index creation.
