Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28246:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `emtgtctl2` executable loading dynamic libraries using relative paths (RPATH) and having SUID/GUID permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Untrusted Search Path:** The `emtgtctl2` executable searches for libraries in multiple paths, including `/prods/ora10/lib`.
*   **SUID/GUID permissions:** The `emtgtctl2` executable has SUID permissions, which means that when executed, it runs with the privileges of the owner, which is `ehealth` user.
*   **Lack of sanitization/validation:** The application does not validate the library path it loads which allows for the loading of arbitrary libraries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject a malicious library into `/prods/ora10/lib`. When `emtgtctl2` is executed, it will load the malicious library, allowing the attacker to gain privileges of the `ehealth` user. This includes the ability to read/write, start and stop eHealth application files and processes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to write the malicious library to a specific directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have a regular user account on the system.
*   The attacker needs write access to one of the directories in the RPATH of the vulnerable executable `/prods/ora10/lib`.
*   The attacker must be able to execute the vulnerable binary `/prods/ora10/bin/emtgtctl2`.
