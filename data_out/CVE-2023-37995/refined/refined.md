{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WP-CopyProtect plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that is unknowingly submitted by an authenticated user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to induce an authenticated user to perform an action (e.g., click a link or submit a form) that triggers the crafted request."
