May 8, 2024 by [Scott Kingsley Clark](https://pods.io/author/sc0ttkclark/ "View all posts by Scott Kingsley Clark")

### This is a **Security focused** release

A security issue was responsibly reported and this release hardens security so that we properly enforce safe URLs for the Pods form submission confirmation page URLs.

### Security hotfixes are now available

Are you running an older version of Pods? A special release has been prepared for each major version back to Pods 2.7 as per our [Security EOL policy](https://pods.io/2024/04/10/eol-security-support-changes-for-older-pods-versions/).
