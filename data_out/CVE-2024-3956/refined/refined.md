Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3956

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Pods Form widget. Specifically, the `thank_you` parameter, used as a redirect URL after form submission, was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows the injection of arbitrary web scripts into pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes whenever a user accesses a page containing the vulnerable Pods Form widget.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `thank_you` parameter in the Pod Form widget.
- An attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious scripts through this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access with Contributor-level permissions or higher.
- Ability to create or modify Pods forms with the vulnerable redirect URL parameter.
- No direct user interaction is required beyond accessing the affected page. The malicious script executes automatically when the user visits the affected page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Pods â€“ Custom Content Types and Fields plugin for WordPress, specifically in all versions up to and including 3.2.1.
- The fix involves using the `pods_enforce_safe_url` function which sanitizes the redirect URL with `wp_sanitize_redirect` and validates it with `wp_validate_redirect`.
- Patched versions include 3.2.1.1 and hotfixes for older versions 2.7.31.3, 2.8.23.3, 2.9.19.3, 3.0.10.3 and 3.1.4.1.
