Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in WinMail's handling of email parameters, specifically a crafted script within the email. This implies a lack of proper input sanitization or validation when processing the email content.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary vulnerability identified is incorrect access control, allowing unauthorized actions.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The crafted script within an email allows for remote code execution, enabling arbitrary code to be run on the victim's system.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The failure to properly sanitize the email input leads to the execution of the malicious script.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can escalate privileges, possibly gaining control of the victim's system and user accounts.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access and disclose all victim's email content.
    *   **Account Takeover:** The vulnerability allows for tampering with account passwords and taking over account permissions.
  
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
    *   **Email Trigger:** The attack is triggered when the victim clicks on a specially crafted email.
  
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim.
    *   **Crafted Email:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious email containing the necessary script.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability in WinMail versions 7.1 and 5.1, lies in the system's failure to properly sanitize email inputs, specifically email parameters. An attacker can embed a crafted script in an email, which, upon being opened, allows arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, and potentially complete account takeover. The attack is triggered when the user clicks on the malicious email and it can be performed remotely.
