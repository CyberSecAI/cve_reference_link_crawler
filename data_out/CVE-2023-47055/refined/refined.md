Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2023-47055:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-After-Free (CWE-416)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Adobe Premiere Pro. This occurs when the software attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the user's system, potentially gaining full control over the affected machine.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). This suggests the attacker needs to have some level of local access to the target system. The user interaction (UI) is required (UI:R) meaning user has to be tricked into performing some actions, like opening a crafted file for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to induce a user to interact with a specially crafted file/project within Adobe Premiere Pro. Since the attack vector is local, the attacker either needs to already be on the system, or trick the user to do something that invokes the vulnerable code.
