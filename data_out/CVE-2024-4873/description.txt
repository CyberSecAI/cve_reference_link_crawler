The Replace Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.10 via the image replacement functionality due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to replace images uploaded by higher level users such as admins.
