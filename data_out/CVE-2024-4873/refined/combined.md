### Description

The Replace Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.10 via the image replacement functionality due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to replace images uploaded by higher level users such as admins.

## Description

The Replace Image plugin adds a button to the Attachment Details screen which allows you to upload or select an image to replace the current image while retaining the URL and attachment ID. This allows you to easily swap in an updated version of an image without having to re-select it in theme settings pages, post/page content, or anywhere else where it might be referenced.

**Important:** Disable your browser’s cache and any WordPress caching plugins before use; otherwise, the plugin may appear not to work. See Tools > Replace Image for instructions.

## FAQ

### I tried to replace an image but nothing happened.

Your browser is likely still caching the old image. Try doing a hard refresh (Ctrl + F5 on Windows, Apple + R / Command + R on Mac) while viewing the page on the frontend. Note that the backend seems to retain cached image thumbnails even after a hard refresh.

This plugin works for Images AND files so before I found this plugin I was deleting the original file, then uploading the updated version. I then had to go to everywhere the file was installed and update it’s URL and then the cache had to be refreshed until I could be sure that everything was ok. Now with Replace Image I simply upload the updated file and open the original and click replace, simple, no changing URL’s or playing with cache, love it.

Crazy that one needs to add a plug-in for something so basic, but since one does, I’m sure glad for this plug-in! But DO delete those caches! Wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why it wasn’t working and that was the answer.
