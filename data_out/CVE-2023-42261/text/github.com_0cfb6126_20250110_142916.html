| First of all, thank you for your effort you put it in sech as great tools like this, I am suggested to add an authentication method on your tools for login to the portal. Also add some categorization of the users such as (admin, analyst, etc.).  Also, it will be better for using MobSF in enterprise environment if it will support several authentication methods like:   * Active Directory * LDAP * OAuth 2 * Local authentication |
