Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-47741:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way IBM Db2 Mirror for i GUI, IBM Navigator for i, and IBM Digital Certificate Manager for i (all web browser client interface implementations) handle sensitive data, including passwords. Specifically, sensitive information is not cleared from memory quickly enough.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Passwords and other sensitive information remain in memory for an extended period within the web browser client implementations.
*   **Insufficient Memory Handling:** The browser implementation does not immediately clear sensitive data from memory after it's no longer needed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the process information of a user's PC could potentially view the sensitive data left in memory.
*   **Potential for Unauthorized Access:** Leaked passwords or credentials could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to affected systems or data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to a PC where an affected web browser client interface is being used.
*   **Process Monitoring:** The attacker would use common tools for viewing process information on a PC to examine the memory of the browser client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access to User's PC:** The attacker must have access to the user's computer where the vulnerable browser client is in use.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to use tools for viewing process information.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   IBM Db2 Mirror for i versions 7.4 and 7.5
    *   IBM i versions 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5
*   **Mitigation:** The issue is addressed by reducing the amount of time the sensitive data is visible in memory by applying the provided PTF fixes.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds or mitigations besides applying the fixes.

The information provided in the security bulletins is consistent with the vulnerability description, offering specifics about the affected products and the remedies.
