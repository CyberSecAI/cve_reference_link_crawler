- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Telerik Report Server versions prior to 2024 Q2 (10.1.24.514) use .NET Framework 4.5.1, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This vulnerability is inherited by the Report Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611), resulting in an XXE vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with low privileges can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read system files, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector involves exploiting the XXE vulnerability via XML External Entity processing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privilege attacker is sufficient to perform the attack.
