**Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'preview_email_template_design' function in the Email Subscribers by Icegram Express plugin lacks proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization leading to sensitive information exposure. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the absence of capability checks on the 'preview\_email\_template\_design' function, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data, including the content of private, password-protected, pending, and draft posts and pages. This allows a malicious actor to view confidential information.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least 'Subscriber' level access to the WordPress site.
