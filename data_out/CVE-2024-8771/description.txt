The Email Subscribers by Icegram Express â€“ Email Marketing, Newsletters, Automation for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'preview_email_template_design' function in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.34. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including the content of private, password protected, pending, and draft posts and pages.
