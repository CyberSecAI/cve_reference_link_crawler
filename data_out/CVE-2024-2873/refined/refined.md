Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2873:

**CVE Description:**

> A properly crafted SSH client can bypass user authentication in the wolfSSH server code. The added fix filters the messages that are allowed during different operational states.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The wolfSSH server did not properly filter messages during different operational states, specifically during user authentication, allowing a malicious client to send messages out of sequence and bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper message filtering during different operational states of the SSH handshake.
- Lack of proper validation of message sequence during user authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful bypass of user authentication on the wolfSSH server.
- Unauthorized access to the system if the attacker can successfully bypass authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious SSH client sending out-of-sequence messages to the wolfSSH server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable wolfSSH server.
- The attacker must have control of a malicious SSH client to send specifically crafted messages.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves filtering the messages that are allowed during different operational states.
- The vulnerability was fixed in wolfSSH version 1.4.17.
- Pull request #670 and #671 on GitHub are related to the fix, with #670 adding the message ID filtering logic and #671 adding a case for user authentication messages after user authentication completes.
