Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-26799**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `dmactl` pointer in the `lpass_cdc_dma_daiops_trigger` function within the Linux kernel's sound subsystem was not initialized. When `__lpass_get_dmactl_handle` is called with an invalid `dai_id`, no value is assigned to `dmactl`, and it retains a garbage value. Subsequently, a null check on this uninitialized pointer may fail leading to undefined behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uninitialized pointer: The `dmactl` pointer is declared but not initialized to a default value (NULL) before being used in a null check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The use of an uninitialized pointer can lead to a crash or other unpredictable behavior.  The null check on the uninitialized pointer might not work as intended.
- The vulnerability can lead to an incorrect branch condition, due to an invalid value of `dmactl`.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `lpass_cdc_dma_daiops_trigger` function with an invalid `dai_id`, causing the uninitialized `dmactl` pointer to be used in a null check.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to trigger audio operations through the affected driver with an invalid `dai_id`.
