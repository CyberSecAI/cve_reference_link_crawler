| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2254825#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-12-16 17:33:41 UTC  ``` It can be that a client sends a VNC_MSG_CLIENT_CUT_TEXT message before sending a VNC_MSG_CLIENT_SET_ENCODINGS message with VNC_ENCODING_CLIPBOARD_EXT for configuring the clipboard extension.  This means that qemu_clipboard_request() can be reached (via vnc_client_cut_text_ext()) before vnc_server_cut_text_caps() was called and had the chance to initialize the clipboard peer. In that case, info->owner->request is NULL instead of a function and so attempting to call it in qemu_clipboard_request() results in a segfault.  In particular, this can happen when using the KRDC (22.12.3) VNC client on Wayland. A malicious or misbehaving VNC client can crash QEMU - only after successful authentication.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2254825#c2)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-12-16 17:39:54 UTC  ``` Red Hat Product Security would like to thank Markus Frank (Proxmox) and Fiona Ebner (Proxmox) for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2254825#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-01-12 18:48:54 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-01/msg02382.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2254825#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-01-12 18:49:44 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2258118](show_bug.cgi?id=2258118 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-6683 qemu: VNC: NULL pointer dereference in qemu_clipboard_request() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2254825#c7)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-04-08 06:57:55 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/405484b29f6548c7b86549b0f961b906337aa68a>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2254825#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-30 09:35:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:2135 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2135](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2135)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2254825#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-22 09:22:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:2962 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2962](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2962)   ``` |  |
