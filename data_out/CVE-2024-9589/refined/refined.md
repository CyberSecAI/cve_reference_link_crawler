**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes, specifically the 'new_meta_name' parameter in the 'wpaft_option_page' function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited via the 'new_meta_name' parameter within the 'wpaft_option_page' function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be authenticated with administrator-level or higher permissions within the WordPress site. The vulnerability is also limited to multi-site installations and installations where `unfiltered_html` has been disabled.
