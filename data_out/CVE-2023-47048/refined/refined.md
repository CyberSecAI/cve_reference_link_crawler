- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, low attack complexity, no user interaction required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to execute code on it.
