- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "fieldId" parameter in the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint is not sanitized or escaped before being output back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which could lead to stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the `fieldId` parameter and lures a victim into clicking the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious URL and convince a victim to access it, typically through social engineering or other means. The victim must be logged into the WordPress admin panel for the exploitation to occur through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
