## Demo

There is a demonstration version of MRBS described
[here](demo.php). Please try not to break it too badly!

## Stability

MRBS is very reliable at this point. All the features
that are needed in day-to-day operation are included. It's very
intuitive for users, so very little or no instruction is needed.
It is in production use at many large organisations around the world
for uses as diverse as it's originally intended meeting rooms to
restaurant tables and aeroplanes at a flying school!

Different languages are supported, there are translations
for many languages available (current list above).
If your language is not supported it is very easy to customize as
all strings are stored in language-specific files.

## Contact

See the [contact page](contact.php).

## History

MRBS was originally written by Daniel Gardner. With the codebase initially
taken from [WebCalendar](http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/)
because it seemed as though they had similar objectives. These days
there is very little (if any) code from the original project. There
have been many contributors to the project, most recently Campbell
Morrison has implemented many features, with some support by John
Beranek.

Everything is provided by [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/) -
because they're nice like that, apart from the code and issue tracker have now moved to
[GitHub](https://github.com/meeting-room-booking-system/mrbs-code).
