| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2308661#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-08-30 10:36:52 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the OpenShift Container Platform where the initialization container for builds (git-clone) runs with elevated privileges. This misconfiguration allows an attacker with developer access to create a malicious .gitconfig file that executes arbitrary commands on a privileged build pod. As a result, the attacker can compromise the worker node hosting the build pod, potentially gaining access to all the workloads running on that node. The impact is critical, as it allows for the compromise of the node's identity and other nodes, depending on cluster configuration.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2308661#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 00:12:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13  Via RHSA-2024:6691 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6691](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6691)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2308661#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 05:30:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14  Via RHSA-2024:6689 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6689](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6689)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2308661#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 05:38:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16  Via RHSA-2024:6687 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6687](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6687)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2308661#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 09:30:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15  Via RHSA-2024:6685 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6685](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6685)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2308661#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 13:25:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12  Via RHSA-2024:6705 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6705](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6705)   ``` |  |
