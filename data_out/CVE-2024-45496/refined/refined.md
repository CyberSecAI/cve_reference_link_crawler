  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `git-clone` container, used during the build initialization process in OpenShift, runs with elevated privileges. This allows unrestricted access to the node.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Misconfiguration of container privileges",
      "Unrestricted access to the node from a container",
      "Ability to inject commands via crafted .gitconfig file"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with developer-level access can execute arbitrary commands on the worker node, potentially leading to a full compromise of the node and its workloads. This can result in unauthorized access to data, resources, and other nodes within the cluster.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious .gitconfig file",
      "Exploiting the build process's privileged security context"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Developer-level access to the OpenShift platform. The attacker needs to be able to initiate builds and provide a crafted .gitconfig file which will be processed during the git clone process."
