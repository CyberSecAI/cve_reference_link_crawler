- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The FortiClient for Windows application does not adequately protect itself from tampering or shutdown attempts by a malicious program or attacker with the same or higher level of privileges. This encompasses multiple weaknesses related to the application's ability to be shut down or altered.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **User Interface or Command Line shutdown:**  The FortiClient user interface or command-line interface could be shut down. This is possible in all versions with default settings.
    - **Service or Process shutdown:** The FortiClient service or processes could be terminated. This vulnerability exists in version 6.2.1 and below.
    - **Uninstall:** The FortiClient could be uninstalled. This applies to all versions under default settings.
    - **Code Injection:** Malicious code could be injected into the FortiClient. This vulnerability affects versions 6.2.0 and below.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially shut down the application, uninstall it, or inject code into it, which could lead to the disruption of the endpoint protection, exfiltration of data, and execution of unauthorized commands.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to execute a malicious program with the same or higher level of privileges as FortiClient on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the targeted machine with the required level of privileges to run malicious programs.
