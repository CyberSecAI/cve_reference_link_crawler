Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding or editing components via the admin panel. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the component input leading to the stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  -  Lack of input sanitization/validation: The application allows unfiltered HTML code, specifically JavaScript, to be saved in the database.
  -  Insufficient output encoding: The application does not properly encode or sanitize the stored data when rendering it in the frontend, allowing the injected JavaScript code to execute.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  -  Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
  -  Potential for session hijacking, defacement, redirection, or other malicious activities on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
  -  The attack is performed via the admin panel.
  -  An attacker can inject JavaScript code by using the components input form.
  -  The malicious script is stored in the application's database and is triggered when the affected page is viewed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  -  The attacker needs to have access to the administrator panel to inject the malicious code.
  -  The attacker does not need to be on the same network, as the stored XSS can be triggered from anywhere when viewing the affected page.

**Additional details:**
The provided content shows steps to reproduce the vulnerability:
1. Access the `/admin/components.php` page after installing GetSimpleCMS.
2. Input malicious XSS code like `<script>alert(1)</script>`.
3. Access the frontend of the site, where the malicious code will execute in the user's browser.
