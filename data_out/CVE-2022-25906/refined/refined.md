Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25906:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization or other checks in the `isH2` function within the `is-http2` package. Specifically, the function doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-provided input when handling the `openssl` option. This allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The `isH2` function executes shell commands based on user-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Total Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    - Confidentiality: An attacker can gain access to sensitive information on the system.
    - Integrity: An attacker can modify or delete files and potentially other system resources.
    - Availability: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service, preventing legitimate users from accessing resources.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the vulnerable package is used.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `openssl` option when calling the `isH2` function. By crafting malicious input for this option, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands.
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is classified as local, meaning the attacker needs read/write/execute capabilities on the system. This implies that the attacker has already some level of access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to call the vulnerable function with crafted inputs for the openssl option.
- The attacker needs local access to the system with read/write/execute privileges. This means they would need to have already compromised the system to a certain degree to be able to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker doesn't need any prior authorization or user interaction with the vulnerable system.

**Additional Information:**

- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A simple PoC is provided, demonstrating how to inject a command via the `openssl` option.
- **No Fix Available:**  There is no fixed version of the `is-http2` package available at the time of this report.
- **Snyk Score:** Snyk assigned a CVSS score of 7.4 (High).
- **NVD Score:** NVD assigned a CVSS score of 7.8 (High).
- The exploit maturity is "Proof of concept".
