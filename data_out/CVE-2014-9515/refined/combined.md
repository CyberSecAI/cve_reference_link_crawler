### **[dfj](/dfj)** commented [Dec 5, 2014](#issue-51064459)

| Dozer uses a reflection-based approach to type conversion. If dozer is used to map attacker-supplied object instances, then the attacker can provide a dynamic proxy that implements an interface matching what dozer expects, but then use an event handler to execute all methods in that interface. As soon as dozer tries to execute any getter/setter methods, they'll trigger the event handler. So if the attacker declares an event handler like:  EventHandler.create(Collection.class, new ProcessBuilder("/usr/bin/evince"), "start")  Evince will be run as soon as dozer tries to map that object.  The exploitable use case seems to be rather limited so far. There must either be an object being mapped to with a getter/setter method that matches a method in an interface on the server classpath, or a manual XML mapping that allows an attacker to force the issue. Apache Camel supports dozer, so this would be a feasible vector for processing attacker-supplied input. Camel may also allow an attacker to supply an XML mapping (I'm not sure if this is true or not), in which case this would be a pretty serious flaw (at least for Camel). There is, however, one remaining barrier to exploitation in a real-world scenario. How can an attacker provide a malicious proxy instance that survives serialization and deserialization, such that they could feasibly send it to a camel route (or other vulnerable endpoint)?  EventHandler is not serializable, and I couldn't easily find another InvocationHandler that was serializable and would permit this kind of attack. security@apache.org has been notified of this issue and has never replied.  For more details, including a PoC exploit, please see: <https://github.com/pentestingforfunandprofit/research/tree/master/dozer-rce> |

| [@dfj](https://github.com/dfj) , I'm not quite sure if this could be a dozer issue. As far as I understand this, the poc seems to leverages JDK's dynamic proxy to create a malicious proxy object using DefaultAopProxyFactory. So at runtime as soon as a proxy object for that particular instance is created (L#101) the payload gets executed. This process goes on anytime this proxy object gets passed to various code based and eventually reaches dozer's execution point at (L#138). Due to the nature of the Corgi object being an executable proxy, as soon as mapper.map(...) gets called, again the payload gets executed. From then, while the mapping is being performed I can't seem to be able to see any payload execution happening! Am I missing anything here? |

| I had a closer look at the poc and I think the serialization/deserialization of dynamic proxy is a little confusing as it does not seem to be related to dozer. If the malicious dynamic proxy object however, gets passed to mapper.map(..) it'll be executed, true. |

| Actually [CVE-2014-9515](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q79q-94j7-5mgg "CVE-2014-9515") is related to an old version of springframework while this has been fixed in spring ages ago. The only issue regarding dozer is that it calls arbitrary getters on a given input object. However, this applies to all bean mapping frameworks with such generic design. So the also applies for orika and many others. Claiming this a reasonable security vulnerability in dozer is IMHO unprofessional. You could also construct a dynamic proxy object that does something evil when the `run()` method is called and the pass this to an execution framework and claim that JDK is vulnerable to such security fraud. IMHO this is showing that sometimes CVEs are not always treaded reasonable. Once a CVE is on all these lists then the entire world is scared about using the according tool and if there is no fix they stop using it without questioning or understanding the actual problem. This is like conspiracy... |

| I'm doing a review of dozer usage in my organization and our composition analysis tools flag dozer for [CVE-2014-9515](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q79q-94j7-5mgg "CVE-2014-9515").  If I understand correctly, the justification being given here is that attacker (user) controlled objects should not be passed to mapper.map? However, I don't see any warnings in the documentation, or guidelines for performing secure code reviews of software using dozer. Such warnings would be insufficient, but would indicate to me that dozer developers were concerned with their user's security.  From a security perspective, I'd be inclined to ask teams to simply not use dozer or other mapping tools and write their own setters/getters if this isn't addressed somehow. Convenience and security are always at odds. |

Such warnings would be insufficient, but would indicate to me that dozer developers were concerned with their user's security.  As far as I understand, the issue here is not Dozer's fault, but just the way reflection works. hohwille's comment is perfectly reasonable. I don't see why it would need a separate warning for it - it's just the basics of reflection.  This is only a vulnerability if you have another vulnerability in your system, which somehow lets a malicious object through - and the object exploits dozer's mappings to execute its code. The only way to foolproof against this is not to use reflection at all - for example, by using mapstruct for mappings - but marking a whole library with a critical security issue simply because it uses reflection is very weird. |

| hihi  I'm a security engineer who ended up here because this project got flagged by our dependency scanner. I've read through the discussion thread and it seems as though the consensus of the project maintainers is that the issue is not with Dozer inherently and that, as such, the issue will not be patched. May I ask that someone from the Dozer team contact the CVE-team at Mitre to initiate the dispute process? This way the CVE can get marked as 'vendor disputed' and thus will pop differently on everyone's vulnerability scan reports.  The CVE team at Mitre can be reached via [this form](https://cveform.mitre.org/).  ty!! |

‚óè Incorrect paths, path wildcards

‚óè HTTP verb/method tampering: security constraints

restricted to specific verbs/methods

‚óè HEAD method used for tampering. RFC2616:

 ‚ÄúIn particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD
methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other
than retrieval‚Äù

‚ÄúThe HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT

return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained
in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical
to the information sent in response to a GET request.‚Äù

CVE-2014-0121

CVE-2010-0738

‚óè JMX Console allows management of Java beans

‚óè HtmlAdaptor servlet has a default security

constraint:

‚óè Tomcat/JbossWeb executes the doGet() servlet

handler to handle HEAD requests (Content-Length)

CVE-2010-0738

‚óè Many exploits in the wild, including the Jboss Worm.

Metasploit example:  http://www.exploit-
db.com/exploits/16319/

‚óè Also works when there is no security constraint at
all, which is the case for Jboss AS 4.x/5.x upstream

‚óè Lesson: always include default authn/authz

JMX Console: lesson learnt?

‚óè CVE-2012-0874

The JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow

unauthenticated access by default in some profiles. Due to the second
layer of authentication provided by the security interceptor, there is no
way to directly exploit this flaw. If a user misconfigured the security
interceptor or inadvertently disabled it, this flaw would be exploitable. A
remote attacker could exploit this flaw to invoke MBean methods and run
arbitrary code in the context of the user running the JBoss server.

‚óè CVE-2013-4810 (rgod, ZDI)

The HP ProCurve Manager (PCM) was found to expose unauthenticated

JMXInvokerServlet and EJBInvokerServlet interfaces. A remote attacker
could exploit this flaw to invoke MBean methods and run arbitrary code in
the context of the user running the PCM server.

Unauthenticated auth

‚óè RFC4513 (LDAP)

‚ÄúAn LDAP client may use the unauthenticated authentication
mechanism of the simple Bind method to establish an
anonymous authorization state by sending a Bind request
with a name value (a distinguished name in LDAP string
form [RFC4514] of non-zero length) and specifying the
simple authentication choice containing a password value of
zero length."

‚ÄúOperational experience shows that clients can (and
frequently do) misuse the unauthenticated authentication
mechanism of the simple Bind method (see Section 5.1.2).
For example, a client program might make a decision to
grant access to non-directory information on the basis of
successfully completing a Bind operation."

Unauthenticated auth

‚óè CVE-2012-5629: JBoss AS

‚óè CVE-2014-0074: Apache Shiro

‚óè CVE-2014-3612: Apache ActiveMQ

‚óè Etc. etc.

XXE (everywhere!)

‚óè General entity attacks

‚óè Parameter entity attacks

‚óè Most Java APIs do not disable entity expansion by

default

‚óè Relies on developers following best practices, e.g.

from OWASP

OWASP XXE guidelines

ÔÉú It wasn‚Äôt always this way:

XXE: CVE-2014-3490

‚óè RESTEasy REST API framework:
It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-0818 was incomplete: external
parameter entities were not disabled when the
resteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false. A
remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could use
this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server,
and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.

‚óè Used by many apps, e.g. oVirt:

‚óè test.dtd on the attacker server:

XXE: CVE-2014-3490

‚óè Patch is simply to use the updated advice from the

OWASP guide:

XXE: XXEBugFind

‚óè https://github.com/ssexxe/XXEBugFind

‚óè Uses soot to parse compiled Java bytecode and

then run it through an analysis and rules engine.
Rules for anti-patterns that identify XXE are defined
in XML.

‚óè Existing rules have some flaws, but the architecture

is rock-solid

‚óè Example flaw I found using XXEBugFind, in a code
base I never read, never understood, and never
wrote a line of code for:

https://www.playframework.com/security/vulnerability
/CVE-2014-3630-XmlExternalEntity

Cmd parameter injection

‚óè When a single command string is input to
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(), the string is
tokenized and split into the command and
parameters

‚óè Direct injection of commands is not possible

‚óè The attacker still has complete control over the

parameters, how can that be abused?

‚óè Example: OpenSSL

Apache Ambari (no CVE)

‚óè First reported Sep 2014, still not patched

‚óè The certificate signing REST API does not require
authentication. It passes user-supplied input to
CertificateManager.signAgentCrt:

https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-
server/src/main/java/org/apache/ambari/server/security/unsecur
ed/rest/CertificateSign.java#L63

‚óè The agentHostname value is derived from user-

supplied input, and is then directly concatenated
into shell commands calling openssl:

https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-
server/src/main/java/org/apache/ambari/server/security/Certifica
teManager.java#L207-219

RCE ‚Äì XSL extensions

‚óè Various XSL libraries allow embedding code in

stylesheets via extensions

‚óè Xalan and Saxon allow embedding Java. Xalan allows

this by default, unless explicitly disabled.

‚óè Even then, there are workarounds:

‚óè You can find many other instances of this issue

RCE ‚Äì XSL extensions

‚óè Example exploit using Java extensions:

RCE ‚Äì XSL extensions

‚óè How can an attacker supply XSL?

‚óè Camel-xslt transforms: http://camel.apache.org/xslt

‚óè Attackers can provide an XML document, but what

about the XSL file?

‚óè CamelXsltFileName message header (accepts

URLs)

‚óè Live demo: CVE-2014-0003

RCE ‚Äì XSL extensions

‚óè Ektron CMS, user-supplied XSL without

authentication (CVE-2012-5357)

‚óè Liferay, XSL portlets (CVE-2011-1571)

‚óè SpagoBI, report presentation view (CVE-2014-7296)

‚óè Apache Solr, in combination with a directory

traversal flaw (CVE-2013-6397)

‚óè Many more to be found. Remember, the app only
has to fail to configure Xalan correctly, OR use an
outdated vulnerable Xalan JAR.

Path traversal

‚óè Basic premise: path either consists of or ends in

user-supplied input

‚óè Input can include ‚Äú../‚Äù to make a relative path
absolute, and access any file accessible to the
process running on the server:

‚óè Poison null byte injection can terminate the path,
allowing the latter case to be exploitable on older
unpatched JDKs

‚óè Encode or double encode, e.g. %2e%2e%2f

CVE-2014-7816

‚ÄúIt was discovered that Undertow, when running on
Microsoft Windows, is vulnerable to a directory
traversal flaw. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to read arbitrary files that are accessible to the
user running the Java process.‚Äù

Why only Windows?

CVE-2014-8114

‚óè Uberfire: information disclosure and RCE via

insecure file upload/download servlets

‚óè RCE by uploading: cmd.jsp

‚óè RCE by downloading?

‚óè Credentials stored on disk

‚óè username=HEX( MD5( username ':' realm ':'

password))

‚óè Do I need to bother demoing that this is easy to

crack?

RCE ‚Äì EL interpolation

‚óè Various expression languages are commonly used

in Java libraries

‚óè MVEL is one example

‚óè Generally speaking, if an attacker can supply EL,
they can execute arbitrary code on the server

‚óè How can an attacker supply EL?

RCE ‚Äì EL interpolation

‚óè Zanata is an open source translation memory

platform built on Seam

‚óè Seam evaluates EL in log messages. If code

performs string concatenation with user-supplied
input to create the log messages, an attacker can
inject EL (Credit: Adrian Hayes)

‚óè Zanata would log user-supplied strings using string

concatenation

EL: CVE-2014-3120

‚óè Elasticsearch enables MVEL embedded in search

queries by default

‚óè This is a feature, and the environment is meant to

be protected

‚óè In many cases, of course, it is not

‚óè Example: JBoss Fuse:

https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1191453

‚óè Live demo

‚óè CVE-2015-1427: sandboxing attempted, blocking
class, getClass(), etc. Pointless, this for example
still works...

EL: Example exploit

Spring EL

‚óè Can be used in a variety of settings, but is not

designed to be user-supplied

‚óè <spring:eval expression="${param.pwn}" />

(new
java.util.Scanner((T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntim
e().exec("cat
/etc/passwd").getInputStream()),"UTF-
8")).useDelimiter("\\A").next()

RCE ‚Äì binary deserialization

‚óè Java contains a native serialization mechanism,

that converts objects to binary data

‚óè When deserializing, the readObject() and

readResolve() methods of the class will be called

‚óè This can lead to vulnerabilities if a class on the

classpath has something exploitable in
readObject() or readResolve()

‚óè How can an attacker provide binary serialized

objects?

RCE ‚Äì binary deserialization

‚óè Serialization is used as a format for transferring

objects over networks, e.g. via REST APIs

‚óè Example #1: RichFaces state (CVE-2013-2165,

Takeshi Terada, MBSD)

‚óè Example #2: Restlet REST framework (CVE-2013-

4271)

‚óè Live demo: CVE-2013-4271 PoC

‚óè What kind of issue could exist in

readResolve()/readObject() that would be
exploitable?

commons-fileupload

‚óè Component to simplify file uploads in Java apps

‚óè DiskFileItem class implements readObject()

‚óè The readObject method creates a tmp file on disk:
tempFile = new File(tempDir, tempFileName);

‚Äì

‚óè tempDir is read from the repository private attribute
of the class, exposing a poison null byte flaw (file-
writing code is native, now patched)

‚óè An attacker can provide a serialized instance of DFI

with a null-terminated full path value for the
repository attribute: /path/to/file.txt\0

‚óè commons-fileupload code embedded in Tomcat

Restlet + DFI

‚óè Upload a JSP shell to achieve RCE

‚óè Solution #1: don't deserialize untrusted content

‚óè Solution #2: don't introduce flaws in

readObject()/readResolve()

‚óè Solution #3: type checking with look-ahead

RCE ‚Äì XML deserialization

‚óè Alternative XML-based serialization formats

‚óè JAXB is the standard (no known flaws)

‚óè Other XML serialization libraries exist, and have

exposed security issues leading to RCE

‚óè We‚Äôll look at two examples: XMLDecoder and

XStream

XMLDecoder

‚óè XMLDecoder‚Äôs XML format can represent a series of
methods that will be called to reconstruct an object

‚óè If XMLDecoder is used to deserialize untrusted

input, arbitrary code can be injected into the XML

‚óè Example: Restlet CVE-2013-4221. Fixed by

removing vulnerable functionality.

XStream

‚óè Reflection-based deserialization

‚óè Has a special handler for dynamic proxies

(implementations of interfaces)

‚óè Attackers can provide XML representing a dynamic
proxy class, which implements the interface of a
class the application might expect

‚óè Dynamic proxy implements an EventHandler that
calls arbitrary code when any members of the
deserialized class are called

‚óè Vulnerable components: Spring OXM, Sonatype

Nexus, Jenkins

XStream in Jenkins

‚óè Jenkins XML API uses XStream to deserialize input

‚óè Access to XML API -> RCE (but not such a huge

deal)

‚óè Live demo: Jenkins

‚óè Solution: blocked DynamicProxyConverter in

XStream wrapper class

‚óè Upstream solution: whitelisting, with dynamic

proxies excluded by default

‚óè More information:

https://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/01/23/java-
deserialization-flaws-part-2-xml-deserialization/

Dozer XML ‚Üî Binary Mapper

‚óè Uses reflection-based approach to type conversion

‚óè Used by e.g. Apache Camel to map types

‚óè If used to map user-supplied objects, then an

attacker can provide a dynamic proxy

‚óè There must either be an object being mapped to with
a getter/setter method that matches a method in an
interface on the server classpath, or a manual XML
mapping that allows an attacker to force the issue.

‚óè Proxy must be serializable (implements Serializable)

‚óè EventHandler is not

Dozer CVE-2014-9515

‚óè Wouter Coekaerts reported a serializable

InvocationHandler in older versions of Spring: CVE-
2011-2894

‚óè Using Alvaro Munoz's CVE-2011-2894 exploit, I was
able to develop a working Dozer exploit. It is only
exploitable if all the aforementioned conditions are
met, and vuln Spring JARs are on the classpath

‚óè Live demo: Dozer RCE

(https://github.com/pentestingforfunandprofit/resea
rch/tree/master/dozer-rce)

‚óè Reported upstream since Dec 2014, no response:
https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues/217

Other InvocationHandlers

‚óè Any common component is useful, but in the JDK

itself means universally exploitable

‚óè Three other InvocationHandlers in Java 7/8:
‚óè CompositeDataInvocationHandler

‚óè MbeanServerInvocationHandler

‚óè RemoteObjectInvocationHandler

‚óè CompositeDataInvocationHandler: forwards getter
methods to a CompositeData instance. No use.

MBeanServerInvocationHandler

‚óè Proxy to an MBean on the server. Potentially useful,
e.g. if MBeans used by JBoss Worm are present.

‚óè Problem 1: attacker must specify correct JMX URL

‚óè Solution 1: JMX is exposed locally on port 1099

‚óè Solution 2: Brute force JMX URL via Java PID

‚óè Problem 2: attacker cannot control code that is run

for any method call, on specific method calls

‚óè EventHandler exploits work no matter which

method is invoked on the proxy object.
MBeanServerInvocationHandler simply calls the
method of the same name on the MBean.

RemoteObjectInvocationHandler

‚óè Proxy to a remote object exported via RMI

‚óè Problem 1: attacker must know details of a remote

object exported to the server

‚óè Solution: JMX registry is exposed via RMI. If JMX
is exposed locally on port 1099, the attacker
could craft an object instance that points to the
JMX RMI URL

‚óè Problem 2: attacker cannot control code that is run

for any method call, on specific method calls

‚óè Future work: look for more potentially exploitable

InvocationHandlers

```
2014-12-14: RCE now working if vulnerable spring jars are on the server classpath

Dozer uses a reflection-based approach to type conversion. If dozer is used to map attacker-supplied object instances, then the attacker can provide a dynamic proxy that implements an interface matching what dozer expects, but then use an event handler to execute all methods in that interface. As soon as dozer tries to execute any getter/setter methods, they'll trigger the event handler. So if the attacker declares an event handler like:

EventHandler.create(Collection.class, new ProcessBuilder("/usr/bin/evince"), "start")

Evince will be run as soon as dozer tries to map that object.

Apache Camel supports dozer, so this would be a feasible vector for processing attacker-supplied input. Camel may also allow an attacker to supply an XML mapping (I'm not sure if this is true or not), in which case this would be a pretty serious flaw (at least for Camel). There is, however, one remaining barrier to exploitation in a real-world scenario. How can an attacker provide a malicious proxy instance that survives serialization and deserialization, such that they could feasibly send it to a camel route (or other vulnerable endpoint)?

EventHandler is not serializable. However, CVE-2011-2894 refers to a serializable proxy class in the Spring framework. With a vulnerable version of Spring on the server classpath, this issue can be exploited to achieve RCE. This is demonstrated by this PoC that maps a Corgi object to a Dachshund object (with the Corgi's width becoming the Dachshund's length). To try it, just run run.sh. The PoC relies on pwntester's CVE-2011-2894 exploit - credit to him for figuring out how to exploit that issue.

security@apache.org has been notified of this issue and has never replied. The dozer project has been notified via the following bug:

[DozerMapper/dozer#217](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues/217)

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [‚ÄúCritical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins‚Äù](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

| I would expect 99.99% of people who use dozer are using either eclipse or intellij, which with a few shortcuts can update and replace any package changes, so i dont see it as a big problem. Its a one-off change for the end-user. |

| Dozer 5.5.1 has vulnerability [CVE-2014-9515](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q79q-94j7-5mgg "CVE-2014-9515"). I couldn't find any information about it in Dozer 6.X release notes and migration documents.  It is either not fixed yet or the information is missing. |
