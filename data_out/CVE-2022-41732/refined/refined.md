- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Maximo Mobile stores user credentials in plain clear text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Storage of sensitive information (user credentials) in an insecure manner (plain text).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can read the stored user credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and associated systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device where the IBM Maximo Mobile application is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the device where the vulnerable application is installed and the user's credentials are being stored in plaintext.
