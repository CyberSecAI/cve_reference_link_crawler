Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the Biostar RGB Peripheral Configuration utility's driver, "BS\_RCIO64.sys". The driver is installed with an insufficient DACL (Discretionary Access Control List), which allows low-integrity processes to interact with the driver. This, combined with vulnerable functions in the driver, enables malicious actors to perform privileged operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The driver contains three main vulnerabilities:

1.  **Arbitrary Physical Memory Read:**  A low-integrity process can use IOCTL 0x226040 to read arbitrary physical memory using `MmMapIoSpace`.
2.  **Arbitrary Physical Memory Write:** A low-integrity process can use IOCTL 0x226044 to write to arbitrary physical memory using `MmMapIoSpace`.
3.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A low-integrity process can use IOCTL 0x226000 to call an arbitrary address, leading to code execution. The first QWORD in the input buffer is treated as a function pointer which is then called by the driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-integrity process can gain higher privileges by leveraging the driver's capabilities.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **System Instability:** The arbitrary code execution can result in a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), making the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves a low-integrity process communicating with the vulnerable driver "BS\_RCIO64.sys" through IOCTLs.
*   The attacker needs to know the device symlink which is "\\\\.\\BS\_RCIO".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.
*   The attacker must be able to interact with the vulnerable driver and send IOCTLs to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker does not require administrator privileges to leverage the vulnerable driver.

**Additional details:**

*   The content provides detailed information about the vulnerable IOCTL codes, the functions involved, and the method of exploitation, including screenshots of the code and a debugger output demonstrating a BSOD.
*   It includes the SHA256 hash of the vulnerable driver, which can be used to identify vulnerable systems.
*   The content also shows the process of opening the device as a low integrity user by leveraging the OSRâ€™s FileTest application and shows the arbitrary execution of code by calling an address controlled by the user.
