Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6525

**Vulnerability:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Progress Bar" widget of the ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `ekit_progressbar_percentage` and `ekit_progressbar_data_duration` attributes are not properly sanitized/escaped when rendered in the HTML.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied data within the `ekit_progressbar_percentage` and `ekit_progressbar_data_duration` attributes before using them in the HTML.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin outputs these unsanitized attributes directly into the HTML context without proper escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts (JavaScript) into pages by manipulating the progress bar element attributes.
*   These scripts will execute whenever a user views the affected page. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via the "Progress Bar" widget within the Elementor page builder.
*   An attacker needs to have authenticated access to the WordPress site as an editor or higher to modify page content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to WordPress as an editor or administrator.
*   **Access to Elementor:** The attacker needs the ability to modify content using Elementor Page Builder.
*   **Knowledge of Elementor Plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable "Progress Bar" widget and its attributes.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `elementskit-lite/trunk/widgets/progressbar/progressbar.php`. The following lines of code show the unescaped output of the vulnerable attributes:

```php
<span class="number-percentage" data-value="<?php echo esc_attr( $ekit_progressbar_percentage ); ?>" data-animation-duration="<?php echo esc_attr( $ekit_progressbar_data_duration['size'] ); ?>">0</span>%
```

The fix involves proper escaping of the data:
In the provided changeset, the tildes `~~` that was likely added to attempt escaping is removed, and `esc_attr` is properly used.

**Affected versions:** All versions of the plugin up to and including 3.0.3 are affected.

**Patched Version:** The vulnerability is patched in version 3.0.4.

**CVSS Score:** 5.5 (Medium)

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
