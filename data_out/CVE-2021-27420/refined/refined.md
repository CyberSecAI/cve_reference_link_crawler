Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-27420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of unsupported HTTP verbs by the UR Firmware web server task.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The web server fails to properly handle receipt of unsupported HTTP verbs. This leads to the web server becoming temporarily unresponsive after receiving a series of these requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The web server becomes inaccessible. Note that the relay remains effective in all other functionality and communication channels, meaning this is primarily a denial-of-service against the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a series of unsupported HTTP requests to the web server interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable device.
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability can be triggered remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The CISA advisory explicitly mentions that this is not particularly significant since the relay remains effective in all other functionality and communication channels.
- The affected products include GE's UR family of advanced protection and control relays.
- The vulnerability is resolved in firmware Version 8.10 and later.
- The CISA advisory recommends network segmentation and other defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation.
