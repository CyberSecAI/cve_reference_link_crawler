#### 3.2.7    [INSECURE DEFAULT VARIABLE INITIALIZATION CWE-453](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/453.html)

UR IED with “Basic” security variant does not allow the disabling of the “Factory Mode,” which is used for servicing the IED by a “Factory” user.

[CVE-2021-27426](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27426) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.8    [EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)

UR shares MODBUS memory map as part of the communications guide. GE was made aware a “Last-key pressed” MODBUS register can be used to gain unauthorized information.

[CVE-2021-27424](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27424) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)).

#### 3.2.9    [USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)

UR bootloader binary Version 7.00, 7.01 and 7.02 included unused hardcoded credentials. Additionally, a user with physical access to the UR IED can interrupt the boot sequence by rebooting the UR.

[CVE-2021-27430](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27430) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

GE strongly recommends users with impacted firmware versions update their UR devices to UR firmware Version 8.10, or greater to resolve these vulnerabilities. GE provides additional mitigations and information about these vulnerabilities in GE Publication Number: [GES-2021-004](https://www.gegridsolutions.com/Passport/Login.aspx) (login required).

GE recommends protecting UR IED by using network defense-in-depth practices. This includes, but is not limited to, placing UR IED inside the control system network security perimeter, and having access controls, monitoring (such as an Intrusion Detection System), and other mitigating technologies in place.

GE recommends users refer to the UR Deployment guide for secure configuration of UR IED and system.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
