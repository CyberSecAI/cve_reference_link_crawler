The plugin works great and has a lot of flexibility in terms of layout, filtering, and responsive settings. As important, the support is incredible. Support tickets are responded to quickly and have always addressed my issues. In one case, I was able to test a feature that will be included in a future release that resolved an issue. The premium version of this plugin is well worth the modest cost.

### [Perfect plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/perfect-plugin-981/)

I love this plugin. I spent two days trying different plugins to find the right way to display team members with multiple dropdown filters and I’m so happy I eventually found Ultimate Grid. It works perfectly, it’s easy to use and has every feature I was looking for, especially the option to exclude or include tags or categories from each dropdown.
The only minor downside is the limited number of skins but apart from that, it’s flawless.
