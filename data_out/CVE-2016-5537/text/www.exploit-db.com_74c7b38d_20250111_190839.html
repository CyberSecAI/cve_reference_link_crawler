Vendor:
===============
www.oracle.com

Product:
=================
Netbeans IDE v8.1

Vulnerability Type:
=========================
Import Directory Traversal

CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2016-5537

Vulnerability Details:
=====================

This was part of Oracle Critical Patch Update for October 2016.

Vulnerability in the NetBeans component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: Project Import).
The supported version that is affected is 8.1. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with logon
to the infrastructure where NetBeans executes to compromise NetBeans. While the vulnerability is in NetBeans, attacks may significantly
impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some
of NetBeans accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of NetBeans accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause
a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of NetBeans.

Vulnerability in way Netbeans processes  ".zip" archives to be imported as project. If a user imports a malicious project
containing "../" characters the import will fail, yet still process the "../".  we can then place malicious scripts outside of
the target directory and inside web root if user is running a local server etc...

It may be possible to then execute remote commands on the affected system by later visiting the URL and access our script if that
web server is public facing, if it is not then it may still be subject to abuse internally by internal malicious users. Moreover,
it is also possible to overwrite files on the system hosting vulnerable versions of NetBeans IDE.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
