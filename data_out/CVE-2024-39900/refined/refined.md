Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a flaw in the OpenSearch reporting plugin. Specifically, the system failed to properly verify if a user was the original author of a private tenant resource (e.g., notebooks) before granting access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core weakness is the lack of sufficient access control validation for private tenant resources. This means that authorized users could bypass intended access restrictions.
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The system does not properly check if a user is the resource author when accessing resources in a private tenant.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An authorized user aware of another user's private tenant resource ID could potentially read the content of that resource.
*   **Integrity Violation:** An attacker might modify or take ownership of private tenant resources that they are not supposed to access. This includes notebooks and other similar resources.
*   **Inappropriate Visibility:** Users can gain unauthorized access to data within private tenants that should be exclusive to the resource creator, violating the separation of access within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires only low privileges.
*   **Authorized User:** The attacker must be an authorized user with either observability or reporting roles.
*   **Knowledge of Resource ID:** The attacker needs to know the resource ID (e.g., notebook ID) of the targeted private tenant resource.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is specific to private tenant resources.
*   The vulnerability does not alter the existing scope of access, but rather is a flaw in how the access control is implemented.
*   The fix is included in OpenSearch version 2.14.
*   There are no workarounds for affected versions.
