- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit of this vulnerability leads to a memory leak, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R). It is not necessary to have privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user to open a crafted file (e.g. Animate document) with the vulnerable Adobe Animate software.
