- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an improper input validation within the System Management Mode (SMM) communication in Dell PowerEdge BIOS and Dell Precision BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can manipulate a System Management Interrupt (SMI) to cause a denial of service during SMM. The impact is described as a loss of availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. An attacker manipulates an SMI (System Management Interrupt) to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local access to the system and must be authenticated with high privileges.
