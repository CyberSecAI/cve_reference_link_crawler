Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient filtering of the `page` parameter in the `/admin/index.php` page of the Airline Reservation System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to manipulate the `page` parameter to include local files, which can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to use the `php://filter` wrapper to base64 encode and read the source code of the `login` page. This could be used to reveal other source code, configuration files or potentially other files containing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/admin/index.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned to be needed to trigger the vulnerability, suggesting an unauthenticated attacker may be able to leverage the issue.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC uses the `php://filter` wrapper, a common technique to bypass some filtering attempts by encoding file content, which could allow attackers to read other files on the server.
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the "itsourcecode Airline Reservation System".
