**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user input in the 'Website Title' parameter during the installation process of BlackCat CMS 1.4.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- This can lead to various impacts, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the 'Website Title' field during the installation process of BlackCat CMS 1.4.1.
- An attacker would need to interact with the installation process of the CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
