The provided content details a SQL Injection vulnerability in jerryhanjj ERP.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `/index.php/basedata/inventory/delete` endpoint. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the POST request is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Escalation of privileges is possible, allowing an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or control the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker can send a crafted POST request to `/index.php/basedata/inventory/delete` with a malicious `id` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific user privileges are mentioned but access to the network where the ERP system is running is required, which may include needing to be authenticated as a user.
- The provided proof of concept includes session cookies and credentials for the admin user, indicating that exploitation can be carried out if the attacker is able to obtain the admin credentials or the vulnerable endpoint is not restricted to authenticated users.
