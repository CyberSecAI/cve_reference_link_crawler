## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Slider by 10Web < 1.2.59 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1) Create a new Slider
2) Add a random image
3) Change "link the slide to" field in Slide options to:
`http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-admin/123','\_blank');alert(1);wds\_slide\_redirect\_link(event,'123`
4) Create a new post and the new Slider via shortcode.
5) Go to this post and click on the image.
6) Close the window that pops up and you will see the XSS in the original window.
