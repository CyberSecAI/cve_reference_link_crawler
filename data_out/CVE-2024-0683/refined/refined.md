**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Bulgarisation for WooCommerce plugin lacked proper authorization checks on several functions, specifically related to generating and deleting labels.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization checks: The plugin did not verify if the user had the necessary permissions to perform actions like generating or deleting labels.
- Direct access to AJAX actions: The AJAX actions for generating and deleting labels were not protected by capability checks, allowing unauthorized users to trigger them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorised label generation and deletion: Unauthenticated and authenticated attackers, including those with subscriber-level access, could generate and delete shipping labels, potentially disrupting the e-commerce operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to AJAX endpoints: By sending crafted requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints (`wp_ajax_woo_bg_cvc_generate_label`, `wp_ajax_woo_bg_cvc_delete_label`, `wp_ajax_woo_bg_econt_generate_label`, `wp_ajax_woo_bg_econt_delete_label`, `wp_ajax_woo_bg_speedy_generate_label`, `wp_ajax_woo_bg_speedy_delete_label`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required to generate labels.
- Subscriber-level access or higher was required to generate and delete labels.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions up to and including 3.0.14.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.15 by adding capability checks and nonces to the AJAX actions.
- The fix included removing the `wp_ajax_nopriv` action and adding a function `woo_bg_check_admin_label_actions` to verify the nonce and the `manage_woocommerce` capability before label creation, deletion or update.
