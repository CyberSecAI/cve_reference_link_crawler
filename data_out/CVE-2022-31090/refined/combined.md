# CURLOPT\_HTTPAUTH option not cleared on change of origin

High

[GrahamCampbell](/GrahamCampbell)
published
GHSA-25mq-v84q-4j7r
Jun 20, 2022

## Package

composer

guzzlehttp/guzzle
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=6.5.7
>=7.0.0,<=7.4.4

## Patched versions

6.5.8
7.4.5

## Description

### Impact

`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. When using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_USERPWD` options before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Previously, we would only consider a change in host. Now, we consider any change in host, port or scheme to be a change in origin.

### Patches

Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port.

### Workarounds

If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle stream handler backend, rather than curl.

Package        : php-twig
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-39261
Debian Bug     : 1020991

Marlon Starkloff discovered that twig, a template engine for PHP, did
not correctly enforce sandboxing. This would allow a malicious user to
execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.14.3-1+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-twig packages.

For the detailed security status of php-twig please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php-twig>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
