Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-31090:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_USERPWD` options were not being cleared when a redirect occurred to a different origin (including changes in host, port or scheme). This could result in the client sending authorization headers to an unintended domain during a redirect.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of authorization headers during redirects.
- Failure to recognize a change in origin, specifically port and scheme changes, when deciding if authorization headers should be stripped.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive authorization headers could be sent to unintended domains during redirects, potentially exposing credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor could set up a website that redirects the client to a different domain. If the client follows the redirect with the vulnerable Guzzle client configured with authentication settings, the authorization headers are sent to the untrusted target domain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control a site that can initiate a redirect to another domain.
- The client application must be using the vulnerable Guzzle version, the curl handler and configure `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` with credentials.
- The attacker would not need to have any credentials for the initial domain, just to control the redirect.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Guzzle versions <=6.5.7 and >=7.0.0, <=7.4.4.
- The fix involves considering any change in host, port, or scheme as a change in origin, and removing the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_USERPWD` options in such cases.
- A partial fix that only addressed host changes was previously implemented in version 7.4.2, but this did not prevent the issue in all situations.
- The Gentoo advisory also notes that the vulnerability has a remote exploit vector.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity by the Github advisory.

The Github advisory provides more detail than the CVE description by explaining how the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option was mishandled and the specific conditions which lead to the vulnerability.
