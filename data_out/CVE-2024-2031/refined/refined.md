Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2031

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'zoom_recordings_by_meeting' shortcode of the Video Conferencing with Zoom WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided attributes within the `zoom_recordings_by_meeting` shortcode. This allows malicious scripts to be injected through shortcode attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into pages. When a user visits a page containing the injected shortcode with the malicious script, the script executes within the user's browser.
*   **Account Takeover/Data Theft:** This can potentially lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, or other malicious activities depending on the injected JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects the malicious JavaScript by crafting a `zoom_recordings_by_meeting` shortcode with malicious attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:**  The attacker must have at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site to create or edit posts/pages and insert malicious shortcodes.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Video Conferencing with Zoom" plugin up to and including 4.4.4.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 4.4.5 by applying proper escaping using `esc_attr()`.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `includes/Shortcodes/Recordings.php` file, where the `data-downloadable`, `data-meeting`, `data-passcode`, and `data-loading` attributes of the `vczapi-recordings-by-meeting-id` div were not properly escaped.
