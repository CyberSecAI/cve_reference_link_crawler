Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Envoy incorrectly accepts a HTTP `200` response from a server when requesting a protocol upgrade, instead of the required `101` Switching Protocols response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Envoy's improper handling of HTTP response codes during protocol upgrades. Specifically, it fails to enforce the RFC7230 requirement of a `101` status code for protocol switching.
*   This allows a malicious or compromised server to potentially inject an upgrade header into a `200` response, which Envoy would incorrectly accept as a valid upgrade.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The vulnerability can lead to request smuggling through Envoy if the upstream server is manipulated to inject the upgrade header within a `200` response. This is not directly exploitable itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based attack.
*   The attack requires an attacker to control or compromise an upstream server that is proxied via Envoy.
*   The attacker must be able to trick the upstream server into injecting an upgrade header into a 200 response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to control or compromise a server that Envoy is forwarding requests to.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the response from the server to inject an upgrade header.

**CVSS v3 Base Metrics:**
*   Attack vector: Network (AV:N)
*   Attack complexity: High (AC:H)
*   Privileges required: None (PR:N)
*   User interaction: None (UI:N)
*   Scope: Unchanged (S:U)
*   Confidentiality: High (C:H)
*   Integrity: None (I:N)
*   Availability: None (A:N)
*   CVSS Score: 5.9 (Moderate)
