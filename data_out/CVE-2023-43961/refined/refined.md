The provided content relates to CVE-2023-43961.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the differential handling of URIs between Sa-Token and Spring. Specifically, Sa-Token's `AntPathMatcher` does not consider a trailing slash ('/') in a URL to be equivalent to the URL without it. However, Spring's path matching does consider them equivalent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The core vulnerability is an authorization bypass. By adding a trailing slash to a protected URL, the Sa-Token security check is bypassed.
- **Inconsistent URI Handling:** The inconsistency in URI handling between Sa-Token and Spring leads to unexpected behavior, allowing requests that should be denied to be processed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authorization checks and access resources that they are not supposed to have access to. In the provided example, an unprivileged user can access the `/admin/password` resource which is intended for `admin` users.

**Attack vectors:**
- By appending a trailing slash to a protected URL. For example, if `/admin/password` is protected, accessing `/admin/password/` would bypass the Sa-Token check.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the application, including those with the extra trailing slash.
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of how path matching works in web applications.
