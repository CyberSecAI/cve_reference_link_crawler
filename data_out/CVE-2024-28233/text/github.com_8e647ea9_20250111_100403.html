# XSS in JupyterHub via Self-XSS leveraged by Cookie Tossing

High

[minrk](/minrk)
published
GHSA-7r3h-4ph8-w38g
Mar 27, 2024

## Package

pip

jupyterhub
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 4.1

## Patched versions

4.1.0

## Description

### Impact

Affected configurations:

* Single-origin JupyterHub deployments
* JupyterHub deployments with user-controlled applications running on subdomains or peer subdomains of either the Hub or a single-user server.

By tricking a user into visiting a malicious subdomain, the attacker can achieve an XSS directly affecting the former's session. More precisely, in the context of JupyterHub, this XSS could achieve the following:

* Full access to JupyterHub API and user's single-user server, e.g.
  + Create and exfiltrate an API Token
  + Exfiltrate all files hosted on the user's single-user server: notebooks, images, etc.
  + Install malicious extensions. They can be used as a backdoor to silently regain access to victim's session anytime.

### Patches

To prevent cookie-tossing:

* Upgrade to JupyterHub 4.1 (both hub and user environment)
* enable per-user domains via `c.JupyterHub.subdomain_host = "https://mydomain.example.org"`
* set `c.JupyterHub.cookie_host_prefix_enabled = True` to enable domain-locked cookies

or, if available (applies to earlier JupyterHub versions):

* deploy jupyterhub on its own domain, not shared with any other services
* enable per-user domains via `c.JupyterHub.subdomain_host = "https://mydomain.example.org"`

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-28233

### Weaknesses

[CWE-352](/advisories?query=cwe%3A352) [CWE-565](/advisories?query=cwe%3A565)
