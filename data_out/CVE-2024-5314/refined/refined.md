- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `sortorder` and `sortfield` parameters within the `/dolibarr/admin/dict.php` file. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to retrieve all the information stored in the database. This could include sensitive data such as user credentials, financial records, and personal information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint, including malicious SQL code within the `sortorder` and `sortfield` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable system.
