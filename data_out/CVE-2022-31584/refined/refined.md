The provided content is related to CVE-2022-31584. It describes a path traversal vulnerability in multiple Flask applications.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `flask.send_file` with attacker-controlled input, or the use of `os.path.join` with untrusted input before passing the result to `flask.send_file`. When `os.path.join` receives an absolute path it ignores previous path components, thus enabling path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- Improper Input Validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access arbitrary files and directories on the server, potentially exposing:
- Application source code
- Configuration files
- Critical system files
- Sensitive data, like passwords or credentials
- Partial system denial of service by requesting large files repeatedly

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests where the filename or path parameters are manipulated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to control (at least partially) the path parameter used in the vulnerable code.

The content provides additional technical details such as:
- Code examples illustrating the vulnerability.
- Remediation guidance: suggesting the use of `flask.safe_join` or `flask.send_from_directory`.
- Proof-of-concept `curl` command.
- References to OWASP Path Traversal guide.
- CVSS vector and score (9.3/10, Critical).

The content also includes a discussion around the validity of the reported vulnerabilities, specifically for small and personal projects, the process of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and the use of static analysis tools like CodeQL and LGTM.
