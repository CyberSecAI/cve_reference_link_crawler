{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation in the CmpAppBP component. Specifically, crafted network communication requests with inconsistent content can cause the component to read internally from an invalid memory address.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition. By triggering the invalid memory access, the affected component could crash, disrupting the normal operation of the CODESYS Control runtime system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. Attackers send crafted network communication requests to the affected CODESYS product.",
    "required_capabilities": "Successful authentication as a user is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must have network access to the affected CODESYS system and valid credentials."
