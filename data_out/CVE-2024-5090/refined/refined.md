### Summary:
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-5090. This vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin for WordPress, specifically within the SiteOrigin Blog widget. It affects versions up to and including 1.61.1.

### Vulnerability Details:
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the SiteOrigin Blog Widget.

- **Impact of Exploitation:**  An authenticated attacker (with contributor-level access or higher) can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into pages using the blog widget. When other users access these pages, the injected script will execute in their browsers. This allows for potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated attacker with Contributor access or higher by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the blog widget settings.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor level access.
