Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Java SE (JDK and JRE) versions through 6u171, 7u161, 8u152, and 9.0.1 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to a takeover of Java, a partial denial of service (DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a takeover of Java, a partial denial of service (DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process.
