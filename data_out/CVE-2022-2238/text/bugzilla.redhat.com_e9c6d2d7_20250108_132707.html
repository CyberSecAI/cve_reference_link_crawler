The web interface allows input of malformed queries in the search filter which then gets parsed by the backend and this results in a prolonged remote denial of service.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2101669#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-10-13 19:16:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2.5 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:6954 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6954](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A6954)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2101669#c3)  Borja Tarraso    2022-10-31 13:51:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2127870](show_bug.cgi?id=2127870 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - redis: lack of sanitization of user-supplied inputs when constructing cypher queries in acm") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2101669#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-11-01 16:53:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:7276 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7276](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A7276)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2101669#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-11-02 14:07:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:7313 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7313](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A7313)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2101669#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-12-03 03:33:17 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
