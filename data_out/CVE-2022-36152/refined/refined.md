The provided content relates to a memory leak issue reported in the tifig project on GitHub. While it doesn't directly provide a CVE description, it details the memory leak vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is in the `sanityCheck` and `decodeFrame` functions in `main.cpp` and `hevc_decode.hpp`, where memory is allocated using `new[]`, `malloc`, and `posix_memalign` but not freed, resulting in memory leaks. Specifically, the issue is found in the following code locations:

  * `src/main.cpp:19:19`: Inside the `sanityCheck` function.
  * `src/hevc_decode.hpp:107:31` & `src/hevc_decode.hpp:87:30`: Inside the `decodeFrame` function.
  * Memory leaks also occur through `av_malloc` calls in the libavutil library used by the project.
  * The lack of proper deallocation results in accumulated memory leaks during program execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Memory leaks due to missing `delete[]` or `free` operations.
*   Improper memory management practices within the `sanityCheck` and `decodeFrame` functions.
*   Use of `malloc`, `posix_memalign`, and `new[]` without corresponding deallocation.
*   Potential indirect leaks through function calls in `std::function` and `pthread_once_slow`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   The primary impact is memory exhaustion. If an attacker provides crafted input that triggers the memory leak repeatedly, the program may consume a large amount of memory, leading to performance degradation, crashes, or denial of service.
*   The leaked memory is significant (27802092 bytes leaked in 727 allocations for the `id27_memory_leak_F7.zip` sample).
*   Resource exhaustion can impact other services/processes if the leak is severe enough, potentially impacting system stability.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through crafted input files passed to the `tifig` utility. Specifically, the `-p` argument is used to process these input files.
*   By providing specially crafted files, an attacker can force the application to trigger memory allocation without releasing the memory, leading to a memory leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to provide arbitrary input files to the `tifig` application using the `-p` argument.
*   No special system privileges are necessary to trigger the memory leaks, making this exploitable locally by any user with access to run the `tifig` tool.

**Additional Details**:
* The issue was reported by user Cvjark
* The report included two crash samples `id0_memory_leakF9.zip` and `id27_memory_leak_F7.zip`
* The commands to reproduce the issue are `../tifig -v -p [crash sample] /dev/null`
* The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
