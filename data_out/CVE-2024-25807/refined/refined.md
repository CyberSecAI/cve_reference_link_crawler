Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application lacks proper request validation when creating albums. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, will create a new album with a title of the attacker's choosing.
*   **Reflective XSS Vulnerability:** The album title field is vulnerable to XSS. When the title of the album, containing malicious code, is displayed the code will be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**  The application doesn't properly validate requests for album creation.
*  **Reflective XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application doesn't sanitize user-supplied input (album titles) before displaying it, leading to the execution of malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into creating albums with titles containing malicious JavaScript.
*   This malicious JavaScript can then be executed when the administrator accesses the page generated by the get interface, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
    *   Data theft or modification.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the administrator's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form targeting the vulnerable album creation endpoint. They then trick a logged-in administrator into visiting this page, causing the malicious form to be submitted automatically.
*   **Reflective XSS:** The attacker uses the CSRF to inject a malicious title. Accessing the album through the get request will execute the XSS payload.
*   **Chained Exploitation:** The CSRF vulnerability is used to create a malicious album. The XSS vulnerability is then triggered when the administrator views album details.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create an HTML page with a malicious form.
*   They must be able to trick a logged-in administrator of the application into visiting the malicious page (e.g., via a phishing email or by hosting it on a site they control).
*   The attacker does not need to be logged into the application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **CSRF POC:** The attacker creates an HTML form that automatically submits a POST request to the `/php/index.php` endpoint with a `function` parameter set to `Album::add` and the `title` parameter set to a value of their choosing.
*   **XSS POC:** The attacker crafts a POST request to `/php/index.php` using the `Album::add` function. The `title` parameter includes an XSS payload `<svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>`.
*   **Combined Exploitation:**  A single HTML file submits a form creating a new album with an XSS payload in the title.  An additional HTML file is used to trigger the XSS using the get request.
