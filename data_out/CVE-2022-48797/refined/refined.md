The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to NUMA balancing and copy-on-write (COW) pages, addressed by commit `80d47f5de5e311cbc0d01ebb6ee684e8f4c196c6`.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect condition used to determine if a COW page should be NUMA-protected during the `change_pte_range()` function. The code was using `page_mapcount(page)` which returns the number of mappings to a page, instead of `page_count(page)` which returns the number of references to a page. This is problematic because even if a page is mapped multiple times, some of those mappings might be paged out, with only the reference in the page count remaining. Furthermore, `get_user_pages` (GUP) can pin pages, creating additional references that are not reflected in the map count.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect check:** The use of `page_mapcount(page)` instead of `page_count(page)` led to NUMA balancing being applied to COW pages that had other references and therefore, should not have been moved.
- **Spurious COW events:**  NUMA balancing attempts to migrate these protected COW pages triggering unnecessary COW events. This implies that the NUMA balancing mechanism is changing page permissions resulting in spurious COW events and data corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption:** Enabling NUMA balancing can lead to data corruption when used in conjunction with GUP to pin pages for DMA operations from accelerators. This occurs because pages that should not be migrated due to other references may be moved to different NUMA nodes.
- **System Instability:** The spurious COW events and data corruption can destabilize the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by enabling NUMA balancing.
- Specifically, the issue occurs in scenarios where a process uses GUP to pin pages for DMA and does not have process affinity set to a specific NUMA node.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to enable NUMA balancing.
- They also need to be able to use GUP to pin pages (usually through a device driver) and run a workload that triggers the issue.

In summary, the vulnerability was due to a logical error in the check for NUMA migration of COW pages, leading to data corruption when NUMA balancing was enabled with pinned pages through GUP. The fix is to replace `page_mapcount(page)` with `page_count(page)` in the conditional statement within `change_pte_range()`.
