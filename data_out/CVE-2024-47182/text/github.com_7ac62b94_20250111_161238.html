# Unsafe hash used for passwords

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 8.5.1

## Patched versions

8.5.3

## Description

### Summary

The app uses sha-256 as the hash for passwords. The app should switch to bcrypt.

### Details

SHA-256 is a message digest hash, and not classified as secure for password hashing. Message digest hashes are designed to be fast, while password hashing mechanisms are designed with certain cryptographic properties (e.g. slow) to protect against vulnerabilities. Refer to the links below for more information:

* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11624372/best-practice-for-hashing-passwords-sha256-or-sha512>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N
