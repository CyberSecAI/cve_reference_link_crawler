Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-13379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a path traversal issue present in the SSL VPN web portal of FortiOS and FortiProxy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The web portal fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when handling HTTP resource requests, allowing an attacker to request files outside of the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download sensitive system files from the affected device. This could lead to exposure of configuration data, credentials, or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Resource Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the SSL VPN web portal, manipulating file paths within the request.
*   **Network:** This is a network-based attack

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability. They can perform the attack remotely over the network.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable FortiOS or FortiProxy device's SSL VPN web portal.

**Additional Information:**

*   The FortiProxy vulnerability affects versions 2.0.0 and below.
*   The FortiOS vulnerability affects versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.4, 5.6.3 to 5.6.7, and 5.4.6 to 5.4.12, ONLY if the SSL VPN service is enabled.
*   Exploit code to steal credentials of logged-in SSL VPN users was publicly disclosed.
*   Two-factor authentication for SSL VPN users mitigates the impact of the disclosed exploit by making stolen credentials less useful to an attacker.
*   The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSSv3 score of 8.9.
*   The issue was discovered and reported by Meh Chang and Orange Tsai from DEVCORE Security Research Team
