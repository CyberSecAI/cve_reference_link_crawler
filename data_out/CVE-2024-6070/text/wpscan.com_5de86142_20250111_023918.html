## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# if-so < 1.8.0.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpcdd\_admin\_menu\_license
2. For the "Geolocation License" enter the payload `"><script>alert(2)</script>`
3. Click "Activate License" and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
