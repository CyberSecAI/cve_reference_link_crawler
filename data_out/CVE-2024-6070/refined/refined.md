Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6070

**Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "if-so" prior to version 1.8.0.4 fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-provided input in its settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. This code will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the relevant pages, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions. The vulnerability can be exploited even if the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed (e.g. in a multisite setup), which provides a way to bypass certain security measures.

**Attack Vectors:** The attacker must have administrative level access or higher on the affected WordPress site. The attacker navigates to the plugin settings page and enters a malicious script into the "Geolocation License" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress site with administrative access. They do not need any additional privileges and can perform the attack even with the standard admin role.

**Additional Information:**

*   The specific vulnerable setting is the "Geolocation License" field.
*   The Proof of Concept demonstrates the attack by injecting `"><script>alert(2)</script>` into this field.
*   The issue is fixed in version 1.8.0.4 of the plugin.
