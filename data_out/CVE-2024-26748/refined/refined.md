Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the git commit logs:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a double-free vulnerability in the Cadence USB3 DRD driver (`cdns3`). When a data transfer completes, the driver appends an additional zero-length packet (ZLP) request if the data length is a multiple of the maximum packet size. This ZLP request is managed internally by the driver. However, the code incorrectly attempts to free this request twice: once through the generic USB gadget framework (`usb_gadget_giveback_request`) and again specifically within the driver (`cdns3_gadget_ep_free_request`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double free. The driver's logic was flawed, leading to a single memory buffer being released twice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Use-After-Free:** As a consequence of the double free, a use-after-free condition arises. The kernel attempts to access the freed memory, potentially leading to a crash or other undefined behavior. The logs show a "BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read" confirming the use-after-free.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit of the use-after-free would result in a kernel panic/crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during the completion of a USB data transfer where the transfer size is a multiple of the max packet size, which causes the driver to append a zero-length packet request. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to initiate USB data transfers that result in the specific scenario of transferring a size that is a multiple of max packet size, causing the ZLP request to be added.
- The attacker must have some control over a device which uses the vulnerable Cadence USB3 DRD driver.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code is in the `cdns3_gadget_giveback` function within `drivers/usb/cdns3/cdns3-gadget.c`. The driver appends a zero-length packet (zlp) request internally, which it should also free internally and not via `usb_gadget_giveback_request`.

The fix is to add a check to see if the request buffer is the driver's zlp buffer. If it is, then `usb_gadget_giveback_request` is skipped.

The code snippet shows the fix:
```c
- if (request->complete) {
+   /*
+    * zlp request is appended by driver, needn't call usb_gadget_giveback_request() to notify
+    * gadget composite driver.
+    */
+    if (request->complete && request->buf != priv_dev->zlp_buf) {
        spin_unlock(&priv_dev->lock);
        usb_gadget_giveback_request(&priv_ep->endpoint,
                request);
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit logs all refer to the same vulnerability, just different commit ids as they were backported to various stable kernel branches.
- The fix is consistent across the different commits.
- The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this CVE is addressed in the updated package of linux-5.10.
