- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an unverified password change.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system does not properly verify password change requests. This allows an authenticated user to change other users' passwords without proper authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to lock other users out of the system and take over their accounts. This could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges within the affected system.
