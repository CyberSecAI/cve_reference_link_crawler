### Description

The Youzify – BuddyPress Community, User Profile, Social Network & Membership Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'delete\_attachment' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary attachments.
