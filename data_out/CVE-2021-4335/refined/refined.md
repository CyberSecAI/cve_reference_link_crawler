Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks on multiple AJAX functions within the Fancy Product Designer WordPress plugin. This means that the plugin doesn't verify if a user has the necessary permissions before allowing them to execute certain AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:**  The core weakness is the missing capability checks on several AJAX handlers. This allows users with lower privileges (like subscriber-level access) to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators or users with higher roles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify plugin settings.
*   **Data Access:** Attackers can retrieve arbitrary order information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can create, update, or delete products, orders, and other sensitive data, which should not be accessible to them. They can access information beyond their own account.
*   **Arbitrary Actions:** The vulnerability can be exploited to execute actions that the attacker is not supposed to be able to perform, due to the improper access controls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable functions within the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user.
*   **Low Privilege Account:** The attacker only needs a low-privilege account, such as a subscriber account.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send the AJAX requests.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable AJAX endpoints and parameters**: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable AJAX functions that lack authorization checks.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Fancy Product Designer plugin versions up to and including 4.6.9.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.7.0.
*   The Wordfence analysis links to a discussion on the Fancy Product Designer support forum which confirms the fix with the message "Improved security for ajax handlers in backend".
