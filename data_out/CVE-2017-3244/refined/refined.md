    "description": "A flaw was found in the way the mysqld_safe script handled creation of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2016-5617, CVE-2016-6664) Multiple flaws were found in the way the MySQL init script handled initialization of the database data directory and permission setting on the error log file. The mysql operating system user could use these flaws to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3265) It was discovered that the mysqld_safe script honored the ledir option value set in a MySQL configuration file. A user able to modify one of the MySQL configuration files could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3291) Multiple flaws were found in the way the mysqld_safe script handled creation of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use these flaws to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3312) A flaw was found in the way MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) handled prepared statements when server connection was lost. A malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to crash an application using libmysqlclient. (CVE-2017-3302) This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory pages listed in the References section.
