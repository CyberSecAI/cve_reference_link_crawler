[CVE-2024-21530  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21530) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-323  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/323.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `cocoon` to version 0.4.0 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption when the `encrypt`, `wrap`, and `dump` functions are sequentially called. An attacker can generate the same ciphertext by creating a new encrypted message with the same cocoon object.

**Note:**
The issue does NOT affect objects created with `Cocoon::new` which utilizes `ThreadRng`.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

4.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

## Package

cargo

cocoon
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.4.0

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

**Problem**: Trying to create a new encrypted message with the same cocoon object generates the same ciphertext. It mostly affects `MiniCocoon` and `Cocoon` objects with custom seeds and RNGs (where `StdRng` is used under the hood).

**Note**: The issue does **NOT** affect objects created with **`Cocoon::new`** which utilizes `ThreadRng`.

**Cause**: `StdRng` produces the same nonce because `StdRng::clone` resets its state.

**Measure**: Make encryption API mutable (`encrypt`, `wrap`, and `dump`).

**Workaround**: Create a new cocoon object with a new **seed** per each encryption.

## How to Reproduce

```
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[1; 32]);
let mut data1 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data1)?;

let mut data2 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data2)?;

// data1: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]
// data2: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]
```
## Workaround

For `cocoon <= 0.3.3`, create a new cocoon with a different **seed** per each `encrypt`/`wrap`/`dump` call.

```
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[1; 32]);
let mut data1 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data1)?;

// Another seed: &[2; 32].
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[2; 32]);
let mut data2 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data2)?;

// data1: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]
// data2: [53, 223, 209, 96, 130, 99, 209, 108, 83, 189, 123, 81, 19, 1]
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* Removing 'self.rng.clone()' as cloning resets the seed is insecure.
- by removing the clone, cocoon has to be mutable now
- all tests pass
- this introduces a potential breaking change, but addresses a pretty big security risk.
* Affected API: `encrypt`, `wrap`, `dump`.

Some `mut`'s are not necessary, they will be cleaned up in the following commit.

### Description

**Problem**: Trying to create a new encrypted message with the same cocoon
object generates the same ciphertext. It mostly affects `MiniCocoon` and
`Cocoon` objects with custom seeds and RNGs (where `StdRng` is used under
the hood).

**Note**: The issue does **NOT** affect objects created with **`Cocoon::new`**
which utilizes `ThreadRng`.

**Cause**: `StdRng` produces the same nonce because `StdRng::clone` resets its
state.

**Measure**: Make encryption API mutable (`encrypt`, `wrap`, and `dump`).

**Workaround**: Create a new cocoon object with a new **seed** per each
encryption.

## How to Reproduce

```
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[1; 32]);
let mut data1 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data1)?;

let mut data2 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data2)?;

// data1: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]
// data2: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]

```
## Workaround

For `cocoon <= 0.3.3`, create a new cocoon with a different **seed**
per each `encrypt`/`wrap`/`dump` call.

```
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[1; 32]);
let mut data1 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data1)?;

// Another seed: &[2; 32].
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[2; 32]);
let mut data2 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data2)?;

// data1: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]
// data2: [53, 223, 209, 96, 130, 99, 209, 108, 83, 189, 123, 81, 19, 1]

| Cloning the StdRng object for every `encrypt` call brings the rng back to the initial seeded starting point. This is a security issue as when you try to create new encrypted messages with the same cocoon object, the IV does not change, and the same ciperblock is returned. See tests below.  ```   pub const SEED: &[u8] = b"123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw";   let seed = SEED;   let mut s = [0u8; KEY_SIZE];    s.copy_from_slice(seed);    let mut rng = StdRng::from_seed(s);    let mut nonce = [0u8; 32];   for i in 0..5 {       let mut rng = rng.clone();       rng.fill_bytes(&mut nonce);        println!("Nonce: {:?}", nonce); } ```  Output:  ``` Nonce: [91, 177, 20, 216, 167, 56, 166, 87, 46, 160, 25, 99, 230, 239, 202, 50, 251, 54, 132, 240, 215, 77, 131, 90, 29, 35, 172, 31, 212, 88, 131, 169] Nonce: [91, 177, 20, 216, 167, 56, 166, 87, 46, 160, 25, 99, 230, 239, 202, 50, 251, 54, 132, 240, 215, 77, 131, 90, 29, 35, 172, 31, 212, 88, 131, 169] Nonce: [91, 177, 20, 216, 167, 56, 166, 87, 46, 160, 25, 99, 230, 239, 202, 50, 251, 54, 132, 240, 215, 77, 131, 90, 29, 35, 172, 31, 212, 88, 131, 169] Nonce: [91, 177, 20, 216, 167, 56, 166, 87, 46, 160, 25, 99, 230, 239, 202, 50, 251, 54, 132, 240, 215, 77, 131, 90, 29, 35, 172, 31, 212, 88, 131, 169] Nonce: [91, 177, 20, 216, 167, 56, 166, 87, 46, 160, 25, 99, 230, 239, 202, 50, 251, 54, 132, 240, 215, 77, 131, 90, 29, 35, 172, 31, 212, 88, 131, 169] ```  Commenting out `let mut rng = rng.clone();`  Output:  ``` Nonce: [91, 177, 20, 216, 167, 56, 166, 87, 46, 160, 25, 99, 230, 239, 202, 50, 251, 54, 132, 240, 215, 77, 131, 90, 29, 35, 172, 31, 212, 88, 131, 169] Nonce: [50, 174, 147, 111, 250, 33, 221, 25, 109, 138, 30, 5, 14, 234, 162, 123, 114, 140, 134, 5, 35, 114, 12, 205, 63, 173, 138, 48, 137, 220, 130, 30] Nonce: [213, 229, 165, 126, 127, 72, 61, 11, 85, 159, 85, 9, 78, 12, 134, 234, 165, 82, 4, 170, 91, 11, 244, 88, 132, 73, 149, 22, 35, 102, 67, 232] Nonce: [189, 243, 159, 198, 83, 41, 103, 147, 244, 13, 187, 2, 189, 102, 232, 90, 249, 71, 170, 30, 118, 15, 223, 75, 8, 146, 219, 161, 117, 159, 87, 42] Nonce: [107, 167, 36, 67, 64, 222, 101, 250, 201, 107, 88, 239, 128, 232, 45, 145, 203, 68, 247, 64, 0, 126, 176, 172, 170, 113, 248, 174, 63, 27, 43, 197] ``` |

| [@ProjectInitiative](https://github.com/ProjectInitiative) What a nasty issue :) Here's the thing: originally, I designed API to be a one-shot, e.g. you initialize Cocoon, dump something, and leave. On the other side, sequential dumping/encrypting is a nice feature. However, changing the API to be mutable would break backward compatibility.  Options:   1. We could introduce `dump_next(&mut self,...)`, `encrypt_next(&mut self, ...)`. 2. Bumping version to `0.4.0`. |

| Both are good, I would suggest a contingency on option 1: might be a good idea to add an crate.io advisory for < 3.x.x as I found this out by NOT using the crate in the intended way, and others might have as well while thinking their implementation was correct.  As for which to select? I am not sure, I will defer the direction of the project to project owner.  I will note from a security perspective, option 2 with a crate.io advisory would force/push dependent projects to re-evaluate and confirm the security they expect in their respective projects. |

| [@ProjectInitiative](https://github.com/ProjectInitiative) I am keen towards moving hardly: *mut + version bump to 0.4.0 + rustsec advisory for <0.3.x*.  Why:   1. I haven't found evidence that I deliberately planned to have an immutable API, although I found a commit, where the API became to be immutable:    [fa4d1d9](https://github.com/fadeevab/cocoon/commit/fa4d1d995bcd4e37195597cbbb37d777a9dd93ea). 2. Introducing additional API calls doesn't make the old API more secure for sequential usage. |

| [@ProjectInitiative](https://github.com/ProjectInitiative) I just found that it was reproduced with `MiniCocoon` ~~only~~ and with `Cocoon::from_seed` (and others with custom RNGs and seeds) where `StdRng` is used! That's why I haven't found it easily in the first place. It means that cloning `ThreadRng` (which is used in `Cocoon::new`) and `StdRng` (which is used in `MiniCocoon` and `Cocoon::from_seed`) behaves differently, or maybe `ThreadRng` adds entropy every time no matter what. |
