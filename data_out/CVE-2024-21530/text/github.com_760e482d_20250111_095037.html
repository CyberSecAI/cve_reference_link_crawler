## Sequential calls of encryption API (`encrypt`, `wrap`, and `dump`) result in nonce reuse

## Package

cargo

cocoon
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.4.0

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

**Problem**: Trying to create a new encrypted message with the same cocoon object generates the same ciphertext. It mostly affects `MiniCocoon` and `Cocoon` objects with custom seeds and RNGs (where `StdRng` is used under the hood).

**Note**: The issue does **NOT** affect objects created with **`Cocoon::new`** which utilizes `ThreadRng`.

**Cause**: `StdRng` produces the same nonce because `StdRng::clone` resets its state.

**Measure**: Make encryption API mutable (`encrypt`, `wrap`, and `dump`).

**Workaround**: Create a new cocoon object with a new **seed** per each encryption.

## How to Reproduce

```
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[1; 32]);
let mut data1 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data1)?;

let mut data2 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data2)?;

// data1: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]
// data2: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]
```
## Workaround

For `cocoon <= 0.3.3`, create a new cocoon with a different **seed** per each `encrypt`/`wrap`/`dump` call.

```
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[1; 32]);
let mut data1 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data1)?;

// Another seed: &[2; 32].
let cocoon = MiniCocoon::from_password(b"password", &[2; 32]);
let mut data2 = "my secret data".to_owned().into_bytes();
let _ = cocoon.encrypt(&mut data2)?;

// data1: [23, 217, 251, 151, 179, 62, 85, 15, 253, 92, 192, 112, 200, 52]
// data2: [53, 223, 209, 96, 130, 99, 209, 108, 83, 189, 123, 81, 19, 1]
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
