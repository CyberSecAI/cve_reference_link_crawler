Versions of the package cocoon before 0.4.0 are vulnerable to Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption when the encrypt, wrap, and dump functions are sequentially called. An attacker can generate the same ciphertext by creating a new encrypted message with the same cocoon object.**Note:**The issue does NOT affect objects created with Cocoon::new which utilizes ThreadRng.
