- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue in the Media Session handling of audio messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The microphone indicator activation is delayed, leading to a few seconds of audio recording before the user is notified the microphone is in use.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user's audio can be recorded for a brief period without their explicit knowledge.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an audio message using the Messages application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send an audio message via the Messages application.
