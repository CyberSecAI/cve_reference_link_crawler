seatd 0.9.1

This release contains two important bugfixes:

- libseat could end up not servicing seat enable/disable events if they
  were received immediately after a response, leading to the session
  deadlocking in a deactivated state.

- Some protocol strings lacked validation of the NULL termination
  requirement.

  In seatd, this could lead to reading a fixed bit of stack memory past
  the end of the string as being part of it. seatd memory does not
  contain any secrets, and the resulting garbage string just leads to an
  early error.

  In libseat, a malicious seatd server could cause heap memory
  corruption in the display server using it, but doing so requires
  extensive pre-existing control of the system, such as controlling the
  display server execution and its environment, having filesystem
  access and having the ability to execute a malicious binary.

In addition, it contains the version number bump which had sadly failed
to make its way into the 0.9.0 tag.

Kenny Levinsen (7):
      Bump version to 0.9.0
      libseat/seatd: Remove read_and_execute
      libseat/seatd: Read remaining events after processing responses
      libseat/seatd: Cleanup of request error handling
      libseat/seatd: Set EINVAL if target session is invalid
      libseat/seatd: Set backend error if poll fails
      Bump version to 0.9.1

Martin Michaelis (2):
      seatd: Add validation of device path libseat/seatd: Add validation of seat_name
      seatd: Add strict message size comparison

seatd 0.9.0

This release contians 35 changes from 6 contributors.

Some highlights of this release:

- Improve session state tracking in the libseat logind backend, which
  could previously fail to notify the libseat client that the session
  had been deactivated.

- Do not trigger a VT switch when starting a logind session, allowing
  sessions to be started in the background.

- Improve error handling in some edgecases in the libseat seatd backend.

- Apply more aggressive security policies to the included systemd unit.

seatd 0.6.4

This release contains a security fix for a vulnerability in the
seatd-launch executable.

A user could specify a socket path that collides with an existing file.
If seatd-launch had the SUID bit set and was owned by a privileged user,
this could be used to remove files that the calling user itself did not
have sufficient privileges to remove.

seatd and libseat are not affected by this vulnerability.

Kenny Levinsen (3):
      seatd-launch: Remove socket path command line arg
      seatd-launch: Use snprintf for socket path
      Bump version to 0.6.4

```
seatd 0.6.3

This release fixes an issue where an interaction between how events
fired from libseat's seatd backend and libinput as of version 1.19 could
cause a compositor to segfault. It also introduces support in libseat's
logind backend for correctly opening an inactive seat while the logind
session is inactive.

Kenny Levinsen (8):
      seatd: Implement ping request to wake up later
      logind: Send ping to wake us up later
      clang-format: Fix alignment
      ci: Inline smoketest into build scripts
      logind: Improve error handling in open_seat
      ci: Add logind smoketest to arch
      logind: Set userdata for ping_handler
      Bump version to 0.6.3

Simon Ser (2):
      logind: check if session is active on startup
      examples/simpletest: check for libseat_dispatch failures

```
seatd 0.6.2

This relase contains a security fix for a vulnerability in the
seatd-launch executable.

A user could manipulate the PATH environment variable to cause
seatd-launch to load a different executable than seatd. If seatd-launch
had the SUID bit set and was owned by a privileged user, this could be
used to mount a privilege escalation attack.

seatd and libseat are not affected by this vulnerability.

Kenny Levinsen (4):
      ci: Install seatd instead of manipulating PATH
      seatd-launch: Use absolute path for seatd
      seatd-launch: Specify exact environment to seatd
