CVE-2022-28150 (CSRF), CVE-2022-28151 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ownership`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ownership)**

**Description:**

Job and Node ownership Plugin 0.13.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to change the owners and item-specific permissions of a job.

Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

|  | This CSRF vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier. See the [LTS upgrade guide](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.277/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-277-2). |
