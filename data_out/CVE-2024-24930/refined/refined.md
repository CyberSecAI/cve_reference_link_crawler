**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The WordPress Buttons Shortcode and Widget Plugin (versions 1.16 and below) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website.
*   **Execution of Malicious Scripts:** These injected scripts will be executed when users visit the compromised pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The specific attack vector is not detailed in the provided content. However, it can be inferred that the vulnerability lies in how the plugin handles user-supplied input in its shortcodes or widget functionality which can lead to XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Contributor Level Access:** The attacker needs at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This means that the attacker would need to be able to add content to a page or post.
