The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the jepaas software, version 7.2.8.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the `orderSql` parameter in the `/je/portal/homePortal/loadUserMsg` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `orderSql` parameter.
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
- Access and extract sensitive information from the database, including user passwords, personal information, and trade secrets.
- Potentially modify or delete data in the database depending on the database user privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/je/portal/homePortal/loadUserMsg`.
- The malicious SQL code is injected via the `orderSql` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker must be able to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads within the `orderSql` parameter.
- It appears the attacker does not need any special privileges since the request uses the session information from a logged in user.
