  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-30319",
      "root_cause": "The affected product uses the S-Bus protocol with authentication functions that can be controlled by the client MAC and IP. Because UDP is stateless, an attacker that can observe traffic can also spoof the MAC and IP of an authenticated client.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Authentication Bypass (CWE-288)",
        "Use of a stateless protocol for authentication"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can spoof the MAC and IP of an authenticated client and manipulate the controller configuration.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker on the adjacent network can observe traffic, spoof MAC and IP addresses.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same adjacent network and be able to observe network traffic."
