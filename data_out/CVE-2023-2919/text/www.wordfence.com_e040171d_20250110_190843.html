### Description

The Tutor LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'addon\_enable\_disable' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable addons via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
