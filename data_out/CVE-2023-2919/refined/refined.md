Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `addon_enable_disable` function in the Tutor LMS plugin lacks proper nonce validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The absence of nonce validation allows attackers to forge requests that can be executed by an authenticated administrator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can enable or disable arbitrary addons of the Tutor LMS plugin.
- This could lead to a denial of service by disabling critical addons, or to the activation of malicious addons, potentially leading to further compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted request that is triggered when a logged-in administrator interacts with it (e.g., clicking a link).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link) that triggers the forged request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Tutor LMS versions up to and including 2.7.4.
- The fix was implemented in version 2.7.5, by adding a `tutor_utils()->checking_nonce()` call at the beginning of the `addon_enable_disable` function.
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N.
- The provided code diff shows the exact line of code that was added to fix the vulnerability.
