**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability found in the School Fees Payment System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `view_payment.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameters are `ef_id` and `pid` within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL path (`/view_payment.php`) and the exploitable parameters (`ef_id`, `pid`).

**Additional Details:**
- The provided `sqlmap` command and the `a.txt` file demonstrate how an attacker might use the `sqlmap` tool to automate the exploitation process.
- The specific vulnerable parameters within the `view_payment.php` endpoint are `ef_id` and `pid`.
- The application version affected is 1.0.
