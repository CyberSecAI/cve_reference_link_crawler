The provided content relates to CVE-2023-6384.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly check for authorization, allowing users with the "author" role to delete and update arbitrary user avatars.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- Broken Access Control

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with author privileges can delete or update the avatar of any user, potentially leading to:
- Defacement of user profiles
- Misrepresentation of user identities

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `remove_user_avatar` or `update_user_avatar` and modifying the `user_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have author level privileges on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress instance.
