Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-1669:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access in the Blink rendering engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access. This can occur when the program tries to read or write memory outside of an allocated buffer, potentially leading to crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The content doesn't specify the exact impact, but out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities can lead to:
  - Crashing the browser
  - Reading sensitive information from memory
  - Potentially, arbitrary code execution, which would allow an attacker to run malicious code within the context of the browser

**Attack vectors:**
- The content doesn't specify how the vulnerability is triggered. Generally, out-of-bounds access in a rendering engine like Blink could be triggered by:
  - Maliciously crafted web pages
  - Specific sequences of browser actions
  - Processing of corrupted or unexpected content
    
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to get the user to interact with or load a page that triggers the vulnerability. This could involve:
  - Luring users to a malicious website
  - Injecting malicious code into a legitimate website
