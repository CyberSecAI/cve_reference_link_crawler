## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CM Pop-Up Banners for WordPress < 1.7.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its popup fields, which could allow high privilege users such as Contributors to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new campaign designed to launch a popup on a given post.
2. Insert the following payload into its Content Input field while in Text mode: &lt;img src onerror&#x3D;alert(`XSS`)&gt;
3. In the Campaign Options > Activity, enable the 'Show on every page' option.
4. Save the changes and view any page on the frontend, or preview the Campaign to trigger the XSS.
