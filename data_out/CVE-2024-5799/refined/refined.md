The provided content is related to CVE-2024-5799.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The CM Pop-Up Banners for WordPress plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in some of its popup fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize the Content Input field, allowing users to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Contributor+ privileges can inject malicious scripts into popup fields, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they visit the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  An attacker with Contributor+ privileges creates a new campaign to launch a popup.
2.  The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code into the "Content Input" field of the popup while in text mode (e.g. `<img src onerror=alert('XSS')>`).
3. The attacker enables "Show on every page" in the Campaign Options > Activity.
4. When any user visits any page on the frontend or previews the campaign, the malicious code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to have at least Contributor privileges on the WordPress site to create and manage pop-up campaigns.
* No other specific attacker capabilities are required. The vulnerability can be triggered by any user visiting a page where the malicious popup is displayed.
