Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Directorist plugin fails to implement proper access controls, allowing users with subscriber-level privileges to access sensitive system information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authorization checks for specific AJAX actions (`send_system_info` and `generate_url`). This allows lower-privileged users (like subscribers) to trigger these actions, which are meant for administrators or higher-level users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `send_system_info` action exposes sensitive system details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker with subscriber access can obtain sensitive system information that could be used to further compromise the system or gain a better understanding of its architecture, potentially aiding in subsequent attacks.
* The returned url also contains a secret url to access system information directly

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the WordPress AJAX handler (`wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`).
*   **Specific AJAX Actions:** The attack relies on exploiting the `send_system_info` and `generate_url` actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Subscriber Access:** The attacker needs to have an account with subscriber-level privileges on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests with specific parameters.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.4.4 of the Directorist plugin.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "NO AUTHORISATION" and aligns with OWASP's "A5: Broken Access Control" and CWE-862 ("Missing Authorization").
*   The CVSS score is 4.3 (Medium)
