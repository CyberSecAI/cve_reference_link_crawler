- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack overflow due to a lack of length checks when copying data from a MQTT packet's `comment` parameter to a stack-based variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack overflow vulnerability in the `setStaticDhcpConfig` function within `/lib/cste_modules/lan.so`.
    - Lack of input validation when handling the `comment` parameter from the MQTT packet.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary code execution by controlling the return address and injecting shellcode.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) attack if shellcode execution fails.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a malicious MQTT packet with a long string in the `comment` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to send MQTT packets to the vulnerable device.
    - Knowledge of the device's MQTT topic structure.
    - Ability to craft a payload with the correct offset and shellcode.
