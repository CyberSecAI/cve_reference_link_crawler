- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper certificate validation when establishing secure connections with threat feed fabric connectors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation [CWE-295]
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote and unauthenticated attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the communication channel between the FortiOS/FortiProxy device and remote servers hosting threat feeds. This can lead to information disclosure and modification of the threat feeds.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the FortiOS/FortiProxy device and the remote threat feed servers.
