- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The BookingPress plugin for WordPress lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, leading to a broken access control issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The plugin does not properly restrict access to certain functions, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can exploit the vulnerability to perform actions that they are not authorized to do. The specific impact varies, but it generally involves bypassing intended access restrictions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no specific privileges or authentication, being able to exploit the vulnerability directly.
