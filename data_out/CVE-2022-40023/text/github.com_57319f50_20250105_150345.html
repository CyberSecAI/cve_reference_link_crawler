Released: Thu Sep 22 2022
* bug

 - [bug] [lexer]

   * Fixed issue in lexer in the same category as that of #366 where the regexp
     used to match an end tag didn’t correctly organize for matching characters
     surrounded by whitespace, leading to high memory / interpreter hang if a
     closing tag incorrectly had a large amount of unterminated space in it.
     Credit to Sebastian Chnelik for locating the issue.

    As Mako templates inherently render and directly invoke arbitrary Python
    code from the template source, it is never appropriate to create templates
    that contain untrusted input.

`[python3-mako: upgrade 1.2.2 -> 1.2.3](/openembedded/openembedded-core/commit/49ad6f031458e1f48f24547dc88e41abc4ec41a6 "python3-mako: upgrade 1.2.2 -> 1.2.3

Released: Thu Sep 22 2022
* bug

 - [bug] [lexer]

   * Fixed issue in lexer in the same category as that of #366 where the regexp
     used to match an end tag didn’t correctly organize for matching characters
     surrounded by whitespace, leading to high memory / interpreter hang if a
     closing tag incorrectly had a large amount of unterminated space in it.
     Credit to Sebastian Chnelik for locating the issue.

    As Mako templates inherently render and directly invoke arbitrary Python
    code from the template source, it is never appropriate to create templates
    that contain untrusted input.

`[CVE-2022-40023](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v973-fxgf-6xhp "CVE-2022-40023") [fix tag regexp to match quoted groups correctly](/ActiveState/mako/commit/6ec3649a6f6521a990cda1b0b2c35f5e4d2d18c4 "CVE-2022-40023 fix tag regexp to match quoted groups correctly

Fixed issue in lexer where the regexp used to match tags would not
correctly interpret quoted sections individually. While this parsing issue
still produced the same expected tag structure later on, the mis-handling
of quoted sections was also subject to a regexp crash if a tag had a large
number of quotes within its quoted sections.

Fixes: #366
