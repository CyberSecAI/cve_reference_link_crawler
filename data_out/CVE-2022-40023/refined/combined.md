# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

fix tag regexp to match quoted groups correctly

```
Fixed issue in lexer where the regexp used to match tags would not
correctly interpret quoted sections individually. While this parsing issue
still produced the same expected tag structure later on, the mis-handling
of quoted sections was also subject to a regexp crash if a tag had a large
number of quotes within its quoted sections.

Fixes: [#366](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/mako/issues/366)

   * Fixed issue in lexer in the same category as that of #366 where the regexp
     used to match an end tag didn’t correctly organize for matching characters
     surrounded by whitespace, leading to high memory / interpreter hang if a
     closing tag incorrectly had a large amount of unterminated space in it.
     Credit to Sebastian Chnelik for locating the issue.

    As Mako templates inherently render and directly invoke arbitrary Python

# **Safety Discovers ReDoS Vulnerabilities in Top Python Packages**

This is the first of a series of posts disclosing novel security vulnerabilities found by Safety's Cybersecurity Intelligence Team, which maintains Safety's proprietary [Python vulnerability database](https://pyup.io/#vuln-db).

â

In this post, we are covering ongoing research by our Cybersecurity team on an often underestimated type of vulnerability: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.

â
Our team has found ReDoS attack vectors in some of the most popular and widely used python packages.

â

## How Does a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) Vulnerability Work?

This attack vector is frequently a concern when a web or other interface like a command line accepts user input. If successfully exploited, the load and resulting availability of your system or service may be affected. While interfaces are the most common concern with this type of attack, Regular Expressions can also be present in many other components of a software system stack, such as firewalls, backends, and many others.

â

![undefined](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64465cf18ba6212696c9289f/647e559e53942ea73337a01f_dfUgxmh8QpOfucR3YfpC.webp)

*(Source: Owasp)*

â

A Regular Expression can be a powerful resource for matching your needed data and text. If misconfigured, Regular Expression matching can take too much time and CPU resources, resulting in a worst-case exponential time execution on the input length of the data being matched.Â

â

When creating Regular Expressions that match the data you want, it can be easy to miss the critical step of also protecting from these potentially exponential time execution runs. This means that there can be poor-performing Regular Expressions in essential components of the software stack that are sometimes hard to detect while also being potentially exploitable.

â

A typical example of a vulnerable Regular Expression is ^(a+)+$

â

With an input like aaaX, this Regular Expression will "walk" all the possible paths for matching until finally failing in the ending character. This is called *backtracking,* and, in this case, the number of steps will grow exponentially with the number of a's in the input.

â

Depending on the programming language, different Regular Expression algorithms, engines, and implementations exist. It's a vast topic, and we won't try to cover that in detail here, but you can read more about Regular Expression matching and algorithms [here](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html).

â

## The steps we followed

With the aid of a variety of tools, we found vulnerable Regular Expressions in many popular Python open-source projects.

â

We then determined if the exploitation was possible by creating *proofs of concept*, informing the package maintainers following the responsible disclosure process, and, in some cases, helping to issue patches.

â

As a result of this research, several flaws were assigned CVE identifiers, and patched versions of the affected packages were released. The first of our findings are summarized in this post.

â

## Affected Packages

Top Python packages were examined according to their number of downloads. We analyzed all python packages with more than 20 million downloads in the last 30 days.

â

### **OAuthLib**

[OAuthLib](https://pypi.org/project/oauthlib/) is a framework that implements the logic of OAuth1 or OAuth2 without assuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. OAuthLib is downloaded more than 85 million times each month.Â

â

#### Vulnerability Details:

The [IPv6 Regular Expression at uri\_validate.py](https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/blob/2b8a44855a51ad5a5b0c348a08c2564a2e197ea2/oauthlib/uri_validate.py#L69) was vulnerable. As a result, an attacker providing a malicious redirect URI or leveraging the usage of uri\_validate functions could cause DoS to OAuthlib's web application.Â

â

**Who is impacted?**

The flaw was introduced in Oauthlib version 3.1.1. Affected are OAuthlib applications that use OAuth2.0 provider support or the uri\_validate function directly.Â

You can find more information [here](https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/security/advisories/GHSA-3pgj-pg6c-r5p7).

â

**Patches**

This issue was fixed in the 3.2.1 release of OAuthLib.

â

**Workarounds**

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading to 3.2.1?*The redirect\_uri can be verified in Web Toolkit such asÂ  bottle-oauthlib or django-oauth-toolkit before OAuthlib is called. A sample check if : is present to reject the request can prevent the DoS, assuming no port or IPv6 is fundamentally required.

â

**Proof of Concept:**

is\_absolute\_uri("http://[:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::]/path")

â

**Assigned Identifiers:**

**Safety Cybersecurity:** [50959](https://pyup.io/vulnerabilities/CVE-2022-36087/50959/)

**CVE:** [CVE-2022-36087](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36087)

â

### **Wheel**

[Wheel](https://pypi.org/project/wheel/) is a reference implementation of the Python wheel packaging standard. Wheel is downloaded more than 155 million times each month.Â

â

#### Vulnerability Details:

The Regular Expression used to verify the validity of Wheel file names was discovered to be vulnerable. This vulnerability can be exploited in two ways: through the use of Wheel as a library or through the use of the Wheel Command Line Interface (CLI). While the use of Wheel as a library is already discouraged in the documentation, the use of the CLI is a more significant concern because it is the *"reference implementation of the Python Wheel packaging standard."*

â

Wheel can also be used as an extension for setuptools (via bdist\_wheel). However, this path doesn't seem to be vulnerable, as there are several parts where [part of the payload string is sanitized](https://github.com/pypa/wheel/blob/5edc61d2c6535c380fa278bc83c578fbd5444167/src/wheel/bdist_wheel.py#L105).

â

**Who is impacted?**

Wheel versions <0.38.0 when parsing a maliciously crafted Wheel file.

â

**Patches**

Wheel 0.38.0 includes the patch. After our disclosure, the maintainers acknowledged the issue, discussed a possible fix, and then applied it in 0.38.0.

â

**Assigned Identifiers:**

**Safety Cybersecurity:** [51499](https://pyup.io/vulnerabilities/CVE-2022-40898/51499/)

**CVE:** CVE-2022-40898

â

### **Mako**

[Mako](https://pypi.org/project/Mako/) is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar, non-XML syntax that compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako is downloaded more than 20 million times each month.Â

â

#### Vulnerability Details:

The [Regular Expression for matching tags start](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/mako/blob/rel_1_2_1/mako/lexer.py#L275) at the Lexer class for parsing template strings was vulnerable.
â

We found this to be reachable in Mako's code not only by calling the Lexer class but also through babelplugin and linguaplugin, which use process\_file function of MessageExtractor class:

![unnamed.webp](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64465cf18ba6212696c9289f/647e559ebdc2e48a7a5dadae_R07rygrVTPyAzvVSoSDY.webp)

â

![unnamed (1).webp](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64465cf18ba6212696c9289f/647e559e80fdbe2b2442495f_FHce1IEZS0OOIuUiYbRZ.webp)

*/mako/ext/extract.py*

â

**Patches**

The [issue was fixed](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/mako/commit/925760291d6efec64fda6e9dd1fd9cfbd5be068c), and a new patched version of mako (1.2.2) was released less than 24 hours after we sent the report to Mako's security email.Â

â

**Assigned Identifiers:**

**Safety Cybersecurity:** [50870](https://pyup.io/vulnerabilities/CVE-2022-40023/50870/)

**CVE:** [CVE-2022-40023](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40023)

â

### **Setuptools**

[Setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) is downloaded more than 203 million times each month.Â

â

#### Vulnerability Details:

The vulnerable Regular Expression is present in package\_index. As a result, a user fetching malicious HTML from a package in PyPI or a custom PackageIndex page may be attacked.

![undefined](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64465cf18ba6212696c9289f/647e559e2c2182b0445b4257_sTo8UP6PTomhj5txZ0Y6.webp)

â

It's worth mentioning that only a small portion of the user base is impacted by this flaw. Setuptools maintainers pointed out that package\_index is deprecated (not formally, but âin spiritâ) and the vulnerability isn't reachable through standard, recommended workflows.

â

**Patches & Vendor Response**

Maintainers acknowledged the issue, discussed a possible fix, [and then applied it in 65.5.1](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/commit/43a9c9bfa6aa626ec2a22540bea28d2ca77964be).

â

**Assigned Identifiers:**

**Safety Cybersecurity:** [52495](https://pyup.io/vulnerabilities/CVE-2022-40897/52495/)

**CVE:** CVE-2022-40897

â

### **Future**

[Future](https://pypi.org/project/future/) allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible codebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead. Future is downloaded more than 33 million times each month.Â

â

#### Vulnerability Details:

Here, we have a known, not patched vulnerability. LOOSE\_HTTP\_DATE\_RE.match [is called](https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future/blob/master/src/future/backports/http/cookiejar.py#L215) when using http.cookiejar.CookieJar to parse Set-Cookie headers returned by a server. Processing a response from a malicious HTTP server can lead to extreme CPU usage, and execution will be blocked for a long time. This issue was already found, patched, and backported in Python core in 2019.
â
You can find more information [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17157).

â

**Patches & Vendor Response**

The issue was reported to Future maintainers on September 1, 2022, but there was no response. We noted that the project might be inactive because the last commit on the GitHub repository was on November 30, 2021, and the last closed issue was on November 27, 2020. There are now 182 open issues.

â

**Assigned Identifiers:**

**Safety Cybersecurity:** [52510](https://pyup.io/vulnerabilities/CVE-2022-40899/52510/)

**CVE:** CVE-2022-40899
