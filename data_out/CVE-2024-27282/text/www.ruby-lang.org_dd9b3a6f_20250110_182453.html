Posted by hsbt on 23 Apr 2024

We have released the Ruby version 3.0.7, 3.1.5, 3.2.4 and 3.3.1 that have a security fix for an arbitrary memory address read vulnerability in Regex search.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-27282](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27282).
