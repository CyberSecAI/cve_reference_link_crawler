- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a type mismatch when comparing a signed integer (`-1`) with an unsigned 16-bit integer (`uint16_t`). The function `processPCCCMessage` returns a length which is then compared to `-1` to detect errors. When an unsupported PCCC command is sent, this function returns `-1`. Due to the type mismatch during comparison (the `uint16_t` will not evaluate to `-1`), the error check fails and an out-of-bounds read occurs due to a large `count` value in a `memmove` function.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)**: The incorrect handling of the return value from `processPCCCMessage` leads to the `memmove` function reading data outside of the allocated memory region, resulting in a crash.
    - **Type mismatch**: The comparison `if (newPcccSize == -1)` fails due to the type mismatch between the unsigned `newPcccSize` variable and the signed integer `-1`, causing the error check to be skipped.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The vulnerability leads to a crash of the OpenPLC runtime due to an out-of-bounds memory access.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Network request**: An attacker can send specially crafted EtherNet/IP requests containing unsupported PCCC commands.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the OpenPLC runtime.

- **Additional Details:**
    - The vulnerability is present in two different code paths: one when processing a `SendRRData` request with `enipType` 0x02, and another when processing `SendUnitData` requests.
    - The large value of `newPcccSize` (0xFFFF) after failing the error check is incremented by 7 and used in `memmove`, resulting in an out-of-bounds read
    - The `memmove` reads beyond the bounds of allocated memory causing a segmentation fault
    - The vulnerability can be mitigated by casting `-1` to `uint16_t` in the affected comparison, as shown in the mitigation section of the report.
