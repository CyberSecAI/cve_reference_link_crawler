Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the Ignite component of Mitel MiContact Center Business. Specifically, it's a stored XSS issue, meaning the malicious script is saved on the server (likely in a database) and executed when other users access the affected application page or functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts can be injected and permanently stored, impacting multiple users upon access of the affected functionality.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before storing it, allowing for injection of malicious script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor can execute arbitrary scripts within the browser of other users interacting with the application. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware Delivery:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or injecting malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the page for malicious purposes.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Displaying fraudulent login prompts or messages to trick users into providing credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application.
*   **Input Manipulation:** The attacker injects a malicious script through a vulnerable input field in the Ignite component's Legacy Chat functionality. This input is then stored by the application.
*   **User Interaction:** The XSS payload is then executed when other users interacts with the content where the malicious script is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the MiContact Center Business Application:** The attacker must have a way to interact with the application in order to inject the script. They need some level of access to the chat component or a related area.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Fields:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific location(s) where scripts can be injected within the Legacy Chat component.

**Additional Information**
* The advisory specifies that the Legacy Chat component is the affected area.
* The risk is rated as critical by Mitel
* Affected product version is MiContact Center Business 10.0.0.4 Hotfix KB560110 and earlier.
