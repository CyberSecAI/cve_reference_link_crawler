- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper data validation during the TLS 1.3 handshake.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the TLS cryptography functionality of Cisco ASA and FTD software, specifically related to how it handles TLS 1.3 handshakes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability can also impact device integrity, causing VPN HostScan communication failures or file transfer failures during upgrades using Cisco ASDM.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS 1.3 packet to an affected system through a TLS 1.3-enabled listening socket.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected system via a TLS 1.3-enabled socket. No prior authentication is required.
