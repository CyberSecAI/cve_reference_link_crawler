This vulnerability is due to improper data validation during the TLS 1.3 handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS 1.3 packet to an affected system through a TLS 1.3-enabled listening socket. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  **Note:** This vulnerability can also impact the integrity of a device by causing VPN HostScan communication failures or file transfer failures when Cisco ASA Software is upgraded using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-tls-CWY6zXB>  This advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software if they are running on a device that has an SSL listening socket and that is configured to allow the TLS 1.3 protocol.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether a Device Can Process TLS Packets To determine whether a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software can process TLS packets, use the **show asp table socket | include SSL** command and look for an SSL listening socket on any TCP port. The following example shows the output for a Cisco ASA device with SSL listening sockets on TCP ports 443 and 8443:  ```   ciscoasa#  show asp table socket | include SSLSSL       00185038  LISTEN     172.16.0.250:443    0.0.0.0:*SSL       00188638  LISTEN      10.0.0.250:8443    0.0.0.0:*      ```  In the following table, the left column lists software features that use TLS for communication. The right column indicates the basic configuration for each feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. These features could cause the SSL listening sockets to be enabled.       | Software Feature | Possible Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | HTTP server enabled1,2 | ``` http server enablehttp ``` |   | SSL VPN3 | ``` webvpnenable ``` |         1. The management web server is affected by this vulnerability only if it is accessed from an IP address that is in the configured **http** command range.   2. For Cisco FTD Software, the HTTP feature is enabled from **Devices > Platform Settings > HTTP Access** in the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC), formerly Firepower Management Center, console.   3. For Cisco FTD Software, remote access VPN features are enabled from **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** in Cisco FMC Software or from **Remote Access VPN** in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).Identify TLS Versions in Software Configuration To determine whether a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software has TLS 1.3 available for connections, use the **show running-config all ssl** CLI command to view the minimum and maximum TLS versions, as shown in the following example:  ```   ciscoasa> enableciscoasa# show running-config all sslssl server-version tlsv1.2 dtlsv1.2ssl client-version tlsv1.2ssl server-max-version tlsv1.3...   ```  If present, the **ssl server-version** configuration determines the minimum TLS protocol version the device will use during negotiation. In the preceding example, **tlsv1.2** is set as the minimum TLS version.  If present, the **ssl server-max-version** configuration determines the highest TLS protocol version that the device will use during negotiation. In the preceding example, the device will accept TLS protocol versions up to **tlsv1.3**. As a result, the device is affected by this vulnerability.  If the **ssl server-max-version** command is absent from the output, the highest available TLS version is negotiable between the client and the device, and the device is affected by this vulnerability.  **Note:** If the **ssl server-max-version** is lower than **tlsv1.3**, the device is not affected by this vulnerability, and the workaround may not be necessary or may already be applied. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco FMC Software.  Workarounds  * If an affected device is running a Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software release that supports the **ssl server-max-version** command, administrators may disable TLS 1.3 as a workaround for this vulnerability.  **Note:** The **ssl server-max-version** CLI command is supported as of Cisco ASA Software releases 9.19.1.24 and 9.20.2 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.4.1. Disable TLS 1.3 on Cisco ASA Software To disable TLS 1.3 on Cisco ASA Software, set the minimum and maximum TLS version to TLS 1.2 using the **ssl server-version** and **ssl server-max-version**commands, as shown in the following example:  ```   ciscoasa# configure terminalciscoasa(config)# ssl server-version tlsv1.2 dtlsv1.2ciscoasa(config)# ssl server-max-version tlsv1.2   ``` Disable TLS 1.3 on Cisco FTD Software To disable TLS 1.3 on Cisco FTD Software, set the minimum and maximum TLS version toTLS1.2using Cisco FMC Software and a FlexConfig object. For more information about FlexConfig objects, see the [FlexConfig Policies for FTD](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/flexconfig_policies.html) chapter of the *Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide*.  To disable TLS 1.3 on Cisco FTD Software, use the following steps:    1. Connect to Cisco FMC Software.   2. From the menu bar, choose **Devices >** **Platform Settings**.   3. Add or edit the Platform Settings Policy that is applied to the affected device.   4. From the navigation menu on the left, choose **SSL**.   5. From the **TLS version** drop-down menu*,* choose **TLSv1.2**.   6. Click **Save**.   7. Choose **Objects >** **Object Management**.   8. From the navigation menu on the left, choose **FlexConfig >** **FlexConfig Object**.   9. Click **Add FlexConfig Object**.   10. Enter a name and description(optional) for the object in the appropriate fields.   11. From the drop-down menus above the main text box, choose **Insert**, **Deployment: Once**, and **Type: Append**.   12. In the main text box, enter **ss server-max-version tlsv1.2**.**Note:** There is no **l** at the end of the word **ss**. This is not a typo. If the word **ssl** is used, Cisco FMC Software will display a validation error when the changes are saved.   13. Click **Save**.   14. From the menu bar, choose **Devices >** **FlexConfig**.   15. Edit the existing FlexConfig Policy or add a new one. If a new policy is being added, enter a name and description (optional) for the new policy in the appropriate fields, then click **Save**.   16. From the**User Defined** drop-down menu on the left, choose the FlexConfig object that was added in step 9.   17. Click **>** to move the object to the**Selected Append FlexConfigs** pane.   18. Click **Save**.   19. From the menu bar, click **Deploy** to deploy the changes.   20. Check the check boxes for devices that are assigned to the policy.   21. Check the **ignore warnings** check box.**Note:** When deploying a FlexConfig object, a validation warning will prevent the deployment until the **ignore warnings** check box is checked.   22. In the dialog box, click **Deploy**. While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.
