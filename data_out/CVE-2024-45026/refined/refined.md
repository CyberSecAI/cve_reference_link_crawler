{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `dasd_ese_needs_format` function in the s390/dasd driver incorrectly checks for error codes, leading to data corruption on Extent Space Efficient (ESE) devices. It was using an imprecise check for 'incorrect length' which could also be triggered by other error cases causing transport of insufficient data. This could lead to incorrect formatting decisions and data corruption, especially during a storage server warm start.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Incorrect format detection logic"
     ],
    "impact": "Data corruption on Extent Space Efficient (ESE) volumes, potentially leading to data loss or system instability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during normal IO processing of ESE volumes when the function `dasd_ese_needs_format` is called upon encountering certain error conditions (e.g., during a storage server warmstart).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to cause a storage server warmstart or otherwise trigger an error condition where the dasd driver would call the `dasd_ese_needs_format` function. The attacker must have access to an s390 system using ESE volumes."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The check for 'incorrect length' has been removed from the `dasd_ese_needs_format` function. It is replaced with an explicit check for 'invalid track format' in transport mode.",
    "The check for 'file protected' has been removed as it is not a valid ESE handling case."
