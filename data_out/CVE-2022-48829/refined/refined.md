Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2022-48829.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of large file sizes in the NFSv3 SETATTR/CREATE procedures within the Linux kernel's NFS server (NFSD). Specifically, when decoding the file size from client requests, the code was silently capping the size to `NFS_OFFSET_MAX` using `min_t()`. This would lead to the server storing a different file size than what the client requested.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect size handling:** The `decode_sattr3()` function was limiting the file size using `min_t()`, potentially truncating large file sizes provided by the client.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data corruption:** A client could request a large file size, but the server would store a smaller size, leading to data inconsistencies and potential unexpected behavior.
- **Unexpected behavior:** The silent capping of the file size could lead to other unexpected issues.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector involves a malicious or misbehaving NFS client sending a SETATTR or CREATE request with a file size larger than `s64_max` (or `NFS_OFFSET_MAX`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable NFS server as an NFS client.
