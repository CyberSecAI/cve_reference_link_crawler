Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-40705

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the "Map setting page" of the VI Web Client. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the malicious script provided by the attacker in the "Map setting page", and it is executed when another user views the same page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of other users who access the compromised "Map setting page." This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing of sensitive information.
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Further attacks against the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the ability to add a specially crafted page, which contains the malicious script, through the VI Web Client's "Map setting page." This implies the attacker needs a valid user account with specific privileges, making it a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when another user accesses the page containing the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account to log in to the VI Web Client.
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker likely needs privileges to modify settings, specifically those related to the "Map setting page".
- **User Interaction:** While the attacker injects the script, a separate user has to access the page to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- This is a stored XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) which signifies moderate severity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in VI Web Client version 7.9.6.
