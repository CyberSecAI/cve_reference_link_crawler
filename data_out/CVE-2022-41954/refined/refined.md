Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of `File.createTempFile()` in MPXJ, which, on Unix-like systems, creates temporary files with insecure permissions (`-rw-r--r--`). This allows other local users to read these files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions:** The core issue is that the temporary files created by MPXJ are readable by other local users due to insecure permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A local attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data by reading the temporary files created by MPXJ while it is processing schedule files. This could lead to information disclosure of the schedule being processed.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local:** The attacker must have local access to the system where MPXJ is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must be a local user on the same system where MPXJ is being used.
- The attacker needs to be knowledgeable enough to locate these temporary files while they are in use by MPXJ.
- The attacker needs to be able to read the files created by the vulnerable application.
- User interaction is required, since it involves processing a schedule file which will then trigger the insecure temporary file creation.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Unix-like operating systems and does not affect Windows or macOS.
- The issue was resolved by replacing `File.createTempFile()` with `Files.createTempFile()`, which sets the correct POSIX permissions.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jonathan Leitschuh.
- The severity is rated as low with a CVSS score of 2.8
- The fix was implemented in MPXJ version 10.14.1 and later.
- A workaround is to set `java.io.tmpdir` to a directory only accessible by the user running the application.
