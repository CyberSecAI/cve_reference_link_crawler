usb: gadget: udc: core: Fix segfault if udc\_bind\_to\_driver() for pending driver fails
commit 163be6ff7739b12ff300d77897d340f661821da2 upstream.
If a gadget driver is in the pending drivers list, a UDC
becomes available and udc\_bind\_to\_driver() fails, then it
gets deleted from the pending list.
i.e. list\_del(&driver->pending) in check\_pending\_gadget\_drivers().
Then if that gadget driver is unregistered,
usb\_gadget\_unregister\_driver() does a list\_del(&driver->pending)
again thus causing a page fault as that list entry has been poisoned
by the previous list\_del().
Fix this by using list\_del\_init() instead of list\_del() in
check\_pending\_gadget\_drivers().
Test case:
- Make sure no UDC is available
- modprobe g\_mass\_storage file=wrongfile
- Load UDC driver so it becomes available
lun0: unable to open backing file: wrongfile
- modprobe -r g\_mass\_storage

CIFS: Fix retry mid list corruption on reconnects
commit abe57073d08c13b95a46ccf48cc9dc957d5c6fdb upstream.
When the client hits reconnect it iterates over the mid
pending queue marking entries for retry and moving them
to a temporary list to issue callbacks later without holding
GlobalMid\_Lock. In the same time there is no guarantee that
mids can't be removed from the temporary list or even
freed completely by another thread. It may cause a temporary
list corruption:

Fix this by obtaining extra references for mids being retried
and marking them as MID\_DELETED which indicates that such a mid
has been dequeued from the pending list.
Also move mid cleanup logic from DeleteMidQEntry to
\_cifs\_mid\_q\_entry\_release which is called when the last reference
to a particular mid is put. This allows to avoid any use-after-free
of response buffers.
The patch needs to be backported to stable kernels. A stable tag
is not mentioned below because the patch doesn't apply cleanly
to any actively maintained stable kernel.

net/flow\_dissector: switch to siphash
commit 55667441c84fa5e0911a0aac44fb059c15ba6da2 upstream.
UDP IPv6 packets auto flowlabels are using a 32bit secret
(static u32 hashrnd in net/core/flow\_dissector.c) and
apply jhash() over fields known by the receivers.
Attackers can easily infer the 32bit secret and use this information
to identify a device and/or user, since this 32bit secret is only
set at boot time.
Really, using jhash() to generate cookies sent on the wire
is a serious security concern.
Trying to change the rol32(hash, 16) in ip6\_make\_flowlabel() would be
a dead end. Trying to periodically change the secret (like in sch\_sfq.c)
could change paths taken in the network for long lived flows.
Let's switch to siphash, as we did in commit df453700e8d8
("inet: switch IP ID generator to siphash")
Using a cryptographically strong pseudo random function will solve this
privacy issue and more generally remove other weak points in the stack.
Packet schedulers using skb\_get\_hash\_perturb() benefit from this change.

net: bcmgenet: reset 40nm EPHY on energy detect
[ Upstream commit 25382b991d252aed961cd434176240f9de6bb15f ]
The EPHY integrated into the 40nm Set-Top Box devices can falsely
detect energy when connected to a disabled peer interface. When the
peer interface is enabled the EPHY will detect and report the link
as active, but on occasion may get into a state where it is not
able to exchange data with the connected GENET MAC. This issue has
not been observed when the link parameters are auto-negotiated;
however, it has been observed with a manually configured link.
It has been empirically determined that issuing a soft reset to the
EPHY when energy is detected prevents it from getting into this bad
state.

net: reorder 'struct net' fields to avoid false sharing
[ Upstream commit 2a06b8982f8f2f40d03a3daf634676386bd84dbc ]
Intel test robot reported a ~7% regression on TCP\_CRR tests
that they bisected to the cited commit.
Indeed, every time a new TCP socket is created or deleted,
the atomic counter net->count is touched (via get\_net(net)
and put\_net(net) calls)
So cpus might have to reload a contended cache line in
net\_hash\_mix(net) calls.
We need to reorder 'struct net' fields to move @hash\_mix
in a read mostly cache line.
We move in the first cache line fields that can be
dirtied often.
We probably will have to address in a followup patch
the \_\_randomize\_layout that was added in linux-4.13,
since this might break our placement choices.

net: netem: fix error path for corrupted GSO frames
[ Upstream commit a7fa12d15855904aff1716e1fc723c03ba38c5cc ]
To corrupt a GSO frame we first perform segmentation. We then
proceed using the first segment instead of the full GSO skb and
requeue the rest of the segments as separate packets.
If there are any issues with processing the first segment we
still want to process the rest, therefore we jump to the
finish\_segs label.
Commit 177b8007463c ("net: netem: fix backlog accounting for

segment in the "rest of segments processing", but as mentioned
above the first segment may had already been freed at this point.
Backlog corrections for parent qdiscs have to be adjusted.

net: ensure correct skb->tstamp in various fragmenters
[ Upstream commit 9669fffc1415bb0c30e5d2ec98a8e1c3a418cb9c ]
Thomas found that some forwarded packets would be stuck
in FQ packet scheduler because their skb->tstamp contained
timestamps far in the future.
We thought we addressed this point in commit 8203e2d844d3
("net: clear skb->tstamp in forwarding paths") but there
is still an issue when/if a packet needs to be fragmented.
In order to meet EDT requirements, we have to make sure all
fragments get the original skb->tstamp.
Note that this original skb->tstamp should be zero in

net/mlx5e: Fix handling of compressed CQEs in case of low NAPI budget
[ Upstream commit 9df86bdb6746d7fcfc2fda715f7a7c3d0ddb2654 ]
When CQE compression is enabled, compressed CQEs use the following
structure: a title is followed by one or many blocks, each containing 8
mini CQEs (except the last, which may contain fewer mini CQEs).
Due to NAPI budget restriction, a complete structure is not always
parsed in one NAPI run, and some blocks with mini CQEs may be deferred
to the next NAPI poll call - we have the mlx5e\_decompress\_cqes\_cont call
in the beginning of mlx5e\_poll\_rx\_cq. However, if the budget is
extremely low, some blocks may be left even after that, but the code
that follows the mlx5e\_decompress\_cqes\_cont call doesn't check it and
assumes that a new CQE begins, which may not be the case. In such cases,
random memory corruptions occur.
An extremely low NAPI budget of 8 is used when busy\_poll or busy\_read is
active.
This commit adds a check to make sure that the previous compressed CQE
has been completely parsed after mlx5e\_decompress\_cqes\_cont, otherwise
it prevents a new CQE from being fetched in the middle of a compressed
CQE.
This commit fixes random crashes in \_\_build\_skb, \_\_page\_pool\_put\_page
and other not-related-directly places, that used to happen when both CQE
compression and busy\_poll/busy\_read were enabled.

mlxsw: core: Unpublish devlink parameters during reload
[ Upstream commit b7265a0df82c1716bf788096217083ed65a8bb14 ]
The devlink parameter "acl\_region\_rehash\_interval" is a runtime
parameter whose value is stored in a dynamically allocated memory. While
reloading the driver, this memory is freed and then allocated again. A
use-after-free might happen if during this time frame someone tries to
retrieve its value.
Since commit 070c63f20f6c ("net: devlink: allow to change namespaces
during reload") the use-after-free can be reliably triggered when
reloading the driver into a namespace, as after freeing the memory (via
reload\_down() callback) all the parameters are notified.
Fix this by unpublishing and then re-publishing the parameters during
reload.

rxrpc: Fix handling of last subpacket of jumbo packet
[ Upstream commit f9c32435ab7221d1d6cb35738fa85a2da012b23e ]
When rxrpc\_recvmsg\_data() sets the return value to 1 because it's drained
all the data for the last packet, it checks the last-packet flag on the
whole packet - but this is wrong, since the last-packet flag is only set on
the final subpacket of the last jumbo packet. This means that a call that
receives its last packet in a jumbo packet won't complete properly.
Fix this by having rxrpc\_locate\_data() determine the last-packet state of
the subpacket it's looking at and passing that back to the caller rather
than having the caller look in the packet header. The caller then needs to
cache this in the rxrpc\_call struct as rxrpc\_locate\_data() isn't then
called again for this packet.

The internal TCP socket is released in smc\_clcsock\_release(), which

ipv4: fix route update on metric change.
[ Upstream commit 0b834ba00ab5337e938c727e216e1f5249794717 ]
Since commit af4d768ad28c ("net/ipv4: Add support for specifying metric
of connected routes"), when updating an IP address with a different metric,
the associated connected route is updated, too.
Still, the mentioned commit doesn't handle properly some corner cases:
$ ip addr add dev eth0 192.168.1.0/24
$ ip addr add dev eth0 192.168.2.1/32 peer 192.168.2.2
$ ip addr add dev eth0 192.168.3.1/24
$ ip addr change dev eth0 192.168.1.0/24 metric 10
$ ip addr change dev eth0 192.168.2.1/32 peer 192.168.2.2 metric 10
$ ip addr change dev eth0 192.168.3.1/24 metric 10
$ ip -4 route
192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.0
192.168.2.2 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.2.1
192.168.3.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.2.1 metric 10
Only the last route is correctly updated.
The problem is the current test in fib\_modify\_prefix\_metric():
if (!(dev->flags & IFF\_UP) ||
ifa->ifa\_flags & (IFA\_F\_SECONDARY | IFA\_F\_NOPREFIXROUTE) ||
ipv4\_is\_zeronet(prefix) ||
prefix == ifa->ifa\_local || ifa->ifa\_prefixlen == 32)
Which should be the logical 'not' of the pre-existing test in
fib\_add\_ifaddr():
if (!ipv4\_is\_zeronet(prefix) && !(ifa->ifa\_flags & IFA\_F\_SECONDARY) &&
(prefix != addr || ifa->ifa\_prefixlen < 32))
To properly negate the original expression, we need to change the last
logical 'or' to a logical 'and'.

net: add skb\_queue\_empty\_lockless()
[ Upstream commit d7d16a89350ab263484c0aa2b523dd3a234e4a80 ]
Some paths call skb\_queue\_empty() without holding
the queue lock. We must use a barrier in order
to not let the compiler do strange things, and avoid
KCSAN splats.
Adding a barrier in skb\_queue\_empty() might be overkill,
I prefer adding a new helper to clearly identify
points where the callers might be lockless. This might
help us finding real bugs.
The corresponding WRITE\_ONCE() should add zero cost
for current compilers.

udp: fix data-race in udp\_set\_dev\_scratch()
[ Upstream commit a793183caa9afae907a0d7ddd2ffd57329369bf5 ]
KCSAN reported a data-race in udp\_set\_dev\_scratch() [1]
The issue here is that we must not write over skb fields
if skb is shared. A similar issue has been fixed in commit
89c22d8c3b27 ("net: Fix skb csum races when peeking")
While we are at it, use a helper only dealing with
udp\_skb\_scratch(skb)->csum\_unnecessary, as this allows
udp\_set\_dev\_scratch() to be called once and thus inlined.

In rtnl\_net\_notifyid(), we certainly can't pass a null GFP flag to
rtnl\_notify(). A GFP\_KERNEL flag would be fine in most circumstances,
but there are a few paths calling rtnl\_net\_notifyid() from atomic
context or from RCU critical sections. The later also precludes the use
of gfp\_any() as it wouldn't detect the RCU case. Also, the nlmsg\_new()
call is wrong too, as it uses GFP\_KERNEL unconditionally.
Therefore, we need to pass the GFP flags as parameter and propagate it
through function calls until the proper flags can be determined.
In most cases, GFP\_KERNEL is fine. The exceptions are:
\* openvswitch: ovs\_vport\_cmd\_get() and ovs\_vport\_cmd\_dump()
indirectly call rtnl\_net\_notifyid() from RCU critical section,
\* rtnetlink: rtmsg\_ifinfo\_build\_skb() already receives GFP flags as
parameter.
Also, in ovs\_vport\_cmd\_build\_info(), let's change the GFP flags used
by nlmsg\_new(). The function is allowed to sleep, so better make the
flags consistent with the ones used in the following
ovs\_vport\_cmd\_fill\_info() call.
Found by code inspection.

net/mlx4\_core: Dynamically set guaranteed amount of counters per VF
[ Upstream commit e19868efea0c103f23b4b7e986fd0a703822111f ]
Prior to this patch, the amount of counters guaranteed per VF in the
resource tracker was MLX4\_VF\_COUNTERS\_PER\_PORT \* MLX4\_MAX\_PORTS. It was
set regardless if the VF was single or dual port.
This caused several VFs to have no guaranteed counters although the
system could satisfy their request.
The fix is to dynamically guarantee counters, based on each VF
specification.

This is due to error in over budget processing.
When dealing with high throughput, the used buffers
that exceeds the budget is not cleaned up. In addition,
it takes a lot of cycles to clean up the used buffer,

net: fix sk\_page\_frag() recursion from memory reclaim
[ Upstream commit 20eb4f29b60286e0d6dc01d9c260b4bd383c58fb ]
sk\_page\_frag() optimizes skb\_frag allocations by using per-task
skb\_frag cache when it knows it's the only user. The condition is
determined by seeing whether the socket allocation mask allows
blocking - if the allocation may block, it obviously owns the task's
context and ergo exclusively owns current->task\_frag.
Unfortunately, this misses recursion through memory reclaim path.
Please take a look at the following backtrace.

In [0], tcp\_send\_msg\_locked() was using current->page\_frag when it
called sk\_wmem\_schedule(). It already calculated how many bytes can
be fit into current->page\_frag. Due to memory pressure,
sk\_wmem\_schedule() called into memory reclaim path which called into
xfs and then IO issue path. Because the filesystem in question is
backed by nbd, the control goes back into the tcp layer - back into
tcp\_sendmsg\_locked().
nbd sets sk\_allocation to (GFP\_NOIO | \_\_GFP\_MEMALLOC) which makes
sense - it's in the process of freeing memory and wants to be able to,
e.g., drop clean pages to make forward progress. However, this
confused sk\_page\_frag() called from [2]. Because it only tests
whether the allocation allows blocking which it does, it now thinks
current->page\_frag can be used again although it already was being
used in [0].
After [2] used current->page\_frag, the offset would be increased by
the used amount. When the control returns to [0],
current->page\_frag's offset is increased and the previously calculated
number of bytes now may overrun the end of allocated memory leading to
silent memory corruptions.
Fix it by adding gfpflags\_normal\_context() which tests sleepable &&
!reclaim and use it to determine whether to use current->task\_frag.
v2: Eric didn't like gfp flags being tested twice. Introduce a new
helper gfpflags\_normal\_context() and combine the two tests.

net: ethernet: ftgmac100: Fix DMA coherency issue with SW checksum
[ Upstream commit 88824e3bf29a2fcacfd9ebbfe03063649f0f3254 ]
We are calling the checksum helper after the dma\_map\_single()
call to map the packet. This is incorrect as the checksumming
code will touch the packet from the CPU. This means the cache
won't be properly flushes (or the bounce buffering will leave
us with the unmodified packet to DMA).
This moves the calculation of the checksum & vlan tags to
before the DMA mapping.
This also has the side effect of fixing another bug: If the
checksum helper fails, we goto "drop" to drop the packet, which
will not unmap the DMA mapping.

inet: stop leaking jiffies on the wire
[ Upstream commit a904a0693c189691eeee64f6c6b188bd7dc244e9 ]
Historically linux tried to stick to RFC 791, 1122, 2003
for IPv4 ID field generation.
RFC 6864 made clear that no matter how hard we try,
we can not ensure unicity of IP ID within maximum
lifetime for all datagrams with a given source
address/destination address/protocol tuple.
Linux uses a per socket inet generator (inet\_id), initialized
at connection startup with a XOR of 'jiffies' and other
fields that appear clear on the wire.
Thiemo Nagel pointed that this strategy is a privacy
concern as this provides 16 bits of entropy to fingerprint
devices.
Let's switch to a random starting point, this is just as
good as far as RFC 6864 is concerned and does not leak
anything critical.

cxgb4: request the TX CIDX updates to status page
[ Upstream commit 7c3bebc3d8688b84795c11848c314a2fbfe045e0 ]
For adapters which support the SGE Doorbell Queue Timer facility,
we configured the Ethernet TX Queues to send CIDX Updates to the
Associated Ethernet RX Response Queue with CPL\_SGE\_EGR\_UPDATE
messages to allow us to respond more quickly to the CIDX Updates.
But, this was adding load to PCIe Link RX bandwidth and,
potentially, resulting in higher CPU Interrupt load.
This patch requests the HW to deliver the CIDX updates to the TX
queue status page rather than generating an ingress queue message
(as an interrupt). With this patch, the load on RX bandwidth is
reduced and a substantial improvement in BW is noticed at lower
IO sizes.

This was preceded by us timing out everything and shutting down the
sockets for the device. The problem is we had a request in the queue at
the same time, so we completed the request twice. This can actually
happen in a lot of cases, we fail to get a ref on our config, we only
have one connection and just error out the command, etc.
Fix this by checking cmd->status in nbd\_read\_stat. We only change this
under the cmd->lock, so we are safe to check this here and see if we've
already error'ed this command out, which would indicate that we've
completed it as well.

nbd: protect cmd->status with cmd->lock
[ Upstream commit de6346ecbc8f5591ebd6c44ac164e8b8671d71d7 ]
We already do this for the most part, except in timeout and clear\_req.
For the timeout case we take the lock after we grab a ref on the config,
but that isn't really necessary because we're safe to touch the cmd at
this point, so just move the order around.
For the clear\_req cause this is initiated by the user, so again is safe.

irqchip/sifive-plic: Skip contexts except supervisor in plic\_init()
[ Upstream commit 41860cc447045c811ce6d5a92f93a065a691fe8e ]
Modify plic\_init() to skip .dts interrupt contexts other
than supervisor external interrupt.
The .dts entry for plic may specify multiple interrupt contexts.
For example, it may assign two entries IRQ\_M\_EXT and IRQ\_S\_EXT,
in that order, to the same interrupt controller. This patch
modifies plic\_init() to skip the IRQ\_M\_EXT context since
IRQ\_S\_EXT is currently the only supported context.
If IRQ\_M\_EXT is not skipped, plic\_init() will report "handler
already present for context" when it comes across the IRQ\_S\_EXT
context in the next iteration of its loop.
Without this patch, .dts would have to be edited to replace the
value of IRQ\_M\_EXT with -1 for it to be skipped.

cifs: Fix cifsInodeInfo lock\_sem deadlock when reconnect occurs
[ Upstream commit d46b0da7a33dd8c99d969834f682267a45444ab3 ]
There's a deadlock that is possible and can easily be seen with
a test where multiple readers open/read/close of the same file
and a disruption occurs causing reconnect. The deadlock is due
a reader thread inside cifs\_strict\_readv calling down\_read and
obtaining lock\_sem, and then after reconnect inside
cifs\_reopen\_file calling down\_read a second time. If in
between the two down\_read calls, a down\_write comes from
another process, deadlock occurs.
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
cifs\_strict\_readv()

OR
cifs\_new\_fileinfo

down\_read(&cifsi->lock\_sem);
Fix the above by changing all down\_write(lock\_sem) calls to
down\_write\_trylock(lock\_sem)/msleep() loop, which in turn
makes the second down\_read call benign since it will never
block behind the writer while holding lock\_sem.

i2c: stm32f7: fix a race in slave mode with arbitration loss irq
[ Upstream commit 6d6b0d0d5afc8c4c84b08261260ba11dfa5206f2 ]
When in slave mode, an arbitration loss (ARLO) may be detected before the
slave had a chance to detect the stop condition (STOPF in ISR).
This is seen when two master + slave adapters switch their roles. It
provokes the i2c bus to be stuck, busy as SCL line is stretched.
- the I2C\_SLAVE\_STOP event is never generated due to STOPF flag is set but
don't generate an irq (race with ARLO irq, STOPIE is masked). STOPF flag
remains set until next master xfer (e.g. when STOPIE irq get unmasked).
In this case, completion is generated too early: immediately upon new
transfer request (then it doesn't send all data).
- Some data get stuck in TXDR register. As a consequence, the controller
stretches the SCL line: the bus gets busy until a future master transfer
triggers the bus busy / recovery mechanism (this can take time... and
may never happen at all)
So choice is to let the STOPF being detected by the slave isr handler,
to properly handle this stop condition. E.g. don't mask IRQs in error
handler, when the slave is running.

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Use the exact ITSList for VMOVP
[ Upstream commit 8424312516e5d9baeeb0a95d0e4523579b7aa395 ]
On a system without Single VMOVP support (say GITS\_TYPER.VMOVP == 0),
we will map vPEs only on ITSs that will actually control interrupts
for the given VM. And when moving a vPE, the VMOVP command will be
issued only for those ITSs.
But when issuing VMOVPs we seemed fail to present the exact ITSList
to ITSs who are actually included in the synchronization operation.
The its\_list\_map we're currently using includes all ITSs in the system,
even though some of them don't have the corresponding vPE mapping at all.
Introduce get\_its\_list() to get the per-VM its\_list\_map, to indicate
which ITSs have vPE mappings for the given VM, and use this map as
the expected ITSList when building VMOVP. This is hopefully a performance
gain not to do some synchronization with those unsuspecting ITSs.
And initialize the whole command descriptor to zero at beginning, since
the seq\_num and its\_list should be RES0 when GITS\_TYPER.VMOVP == 1.

ARM: 8926/1: v7m: remove register save to stack before svc
[ Upstream commit 2ecb287998a47cc0a766f6071f63bc185f338540 ]
r0-r3 & r12 registers are saved & restored, before & after svc
respectively. Intention was to preserve those registers across thread to
handler mode switch.
On v7-M, hardware saves the register context upon exception in AAPCS
complaint way. Restoring r0-r3 & r12 is done from stack location where
hardware saves it, not from the location on stack where these registers
were saved.
To clarify, on stm32f429 discovery board:
1. before svc, sp - 0x90009ff8
2. r0-r3,r12 saved to 0x90009ff8 - 0x9000a00b
3. upon svc, h/w decrements sp by 32 & pushes registers onto stack
4. after svc, sp - 0x90009fd8
5. r0-r3,r12 restored from 0x90009fd8 - 0x90009feb
Above means r0-r3,r12 is not restored from the location where they are
saved, but since hardware pushes the registers onto stack, the registers
are restored correctly.
Note that during register saving to stack (step 2), it goes past
0x9000a000. And it seems, based on objdump, there are global symbols
residing there, and it perhaps can cause issues on a non-XIP Kernel
(on XIP, data section is setup later).
Based on the analysis above, manually saving registers onto stack is at
best no-op and at worst can cause data section corruption. Hence remove
storing of registers onto stack before svc.

scsi: target: core: Do not overwrite CDB byte 1
[ Upstream commit 27e84243cb63601a10e366afe3e2d05bb03c1cb5 ]
passthrough\_parse\_cdb() - used by TCMU and PSCSI - attepts to reset the LUN
field of SCSI-2 CDBs (bits 5,6,7 of byte 1). The current code is wrong as
for newer commands not having the LUN field it overwrites relevant command
bits (e.g. for SECURITY PROTOCOL IN / OUT). We think this code was
unnecessary from the beginning or at least it is no longer useful. So we
remove it entirely.

ARM: 8908/1: add \_\_always\_inline to functions called from \_\_get\_user\_check()
[ Upstream commit 851140ab0d083c78e5723a8b1cbd258f567a7aff ]
KernelCI reports that bcm2835\_defconfig is no longer booting since
commit ac7c3e4ff401 ("compiler: enable CONFIG\_OPTIMIZE\_INLINING
forcibly") (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/26/825).
I also received a regression report from Nicolas Saenz Julienne
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/27/263).
This problem has cropped up on bcm2835\_defconfig because it enables
CONFIG\_CC\_OPTIMIZE\_FOR\_SIZE. The compiler tends to prefer not inlining
functions with -Os. I was able to reproduce it with other boards and
defconfig files by manually enabling CONFIG\_CC\_OPTIMIZE\_FOR\_SIZE.
The \_\_get\_user\_check() specifically uses r0, r1, r2 registers.
So, uaccess\_save\_and\_enable() and uaccess\_restore() must be inlined.
Otherwise, those register assignments would be entirely dropped,
according to my analysis of the disassembly.
Prior to commit 9012d011660e ("compiler: allow all arches to enable
CONFIG\_OPTIMIZE\_INLINING"), the 'inline' marker was always enough for
inlining functions, except on x86.
Since that commit, all architectures can enable CONFIG\_OPTIMIZE\_INLINING.
So, \_\_always\_inline is now the only guaranteed way of forcible inlining.
I added \_\_always\_inline to 4 functions in the call-graph from the
\_\_get\_user\_check() macro.

ARM: dts: Use level interrupt for omap4 & 5 wlcore
[ Upstream commit 087a2b7ec973f6f30f6e7b72cb50b6f7734ffdd2 ]
Commit 572cf7d7b07d ("ARM: dts: Improve omap l4per idling with wlcore edge
sensitive interrupt") changed wlcore interrupts to use edge interrupt based
on what's specified in the wl1835mod.pdf data sheet.
However, there are still cases where we can have lost interrupts as
described in omap\_gpio\_unidle(). And using a level interrupt instead of edge
interrupt helps as we avoid the check for untriggered GPIO interrupts in
omap\_gpio\_unidle().
And with commit e6818d29ea15 ("gpio: gpio-omap: configure edge detection
for level IRQs for idle wakeup") GPIOs idle just fine with level interrupts.
Let's change omap4 and 5 wlcore users back to using level interrupt
instead of edge interrupt. Let's not change the others as I've only seen
this on omap4 and 5, probably because the other SoCs don't have l4per idle
independent of the CPUs.

From the schematics a voltage range of 0.8V to 1.7V can be calculated.

Fix the pinctrl and interrupt specifier for RK808 to use GPIO3\_B2. On the

Tested by setting an RTC wakealarm and checking /proc/interrupts counters.
Without this patch, neither the rockchip\_gpio\_irq counter for the RK808,
nor the RTC alarm counter increment when the alarm time is reached.
With this patch, both interrupt counters increment by 1 as expected.

arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Drop PMU node
[ Upstream commit ed3e9406bcbc32f84dc4aa4cb4767852e5ab086c ]
Looks like PMU in A64 is broken, it generates no interrupts at all and
as result 'perf top' shows no events.
Tested on Pine64-LTS.

arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: pine64-plus: Add PHY regulator delay
[ Upstream commit 2511366797fa6ab4a404b4b000ef7cd262aaafe8 ]
Depending on kernel and bootloader configuration, it's possible that
Realtek ethernet PHY isn't powered on properly. According to the
datasheet, it needs 30ms to power up and then some more time before it
can be used.
Fix that by adding 100ms ramp delay to regulator responsible for
powering PHY.

regulator: da9062: fix suspend\_enable/disable preparation
[ Upstream commit a72865f057820ea9f57597915da4b651d65eb92f ]
Currently the suspend reg\_field maps to the pmic voltage selection bits
and is used during suspend\_enabe/disable() and during get\_mode(). This
seems to be wrong for both use cases.
Use case one (suspend\_enabe/disable):
Those callbacks are used to mark a regulator device as enabled/disabled
during suspend. Marking the regulator enabled during suspend is done by
the LDOx\_CONF/BUCKx\_CONF bit within the LDOx\_CONT/BUCKx\_CONT registers.
Setting this bit tells the DA9062 PMIC state machine to keep the
regulator on in POWERDOWN mode and switch to suspend voltage.
Use case two (get\_mode):
The get\_mode callback is used to retrieve the active mode state. Since
the regulator-setting-A is used for the active state and
regulator-setting-B for the suspend state there is no need to check
which regulator setting is active.

ASoC: wm8994: Do not register inapplicable controls for WM1811
[ Upstream commit ca2347190adb5e4eece73a2b16e96e651c46246b ]
In case of WM1811 device there are currently being registered controls
referring to registers not existing on that device.
It has been noticed when getting values of "AIF1ADC2 Volume", "AIF1DAC2
Volume" controls was failing during ALSA state restoring at boot time:
"amixer: Mixer hw:0 load error: Device or resource busy"
Reading some registers through I2C was failing with EBUSY error and
indeed these registers were not available according to the datasheet.
To fix this controls not available on WM1811 are moved to a separate
array and registered only for WM8994 and WM8958.
There are some further differences between WM8994 and WM1811,
e.g. registers 603h, 604h, 605h, which are not covered in this patch.

regulator: of: fix suspend-min/max-voltage parsing
[ Upstream commit 131cb1210d4b58acb0695707dad2eb90dcb50a2a ]
Currently the regulator-suspend-min/max-microvolt must be within the
root regulator node but the dt-bindings specifies it as subnode
properties for the regulator-state-[mem/disk/standby] node. The only DT
using this bindings currently is the at91-sama5d2\_xplained.dts and this
DT uses it correctly. I don't know if it isn't tested but it can't work
without this fix.
