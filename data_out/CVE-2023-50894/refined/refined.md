**Vulnerability:** Hard-Coded Encryption Password Allows for Authenticated Leak of Cleartext Database Credentials

**Product:** Janitza GridVis

**Versions Affected:** < 9.0.67

**Root Cause:** The software uses a hard-coded encryption password. This password is used to encrypt database credentials, but due to it being hardcoded, an attacker can easily decrypt these credentials.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Hard-coded credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of a hard-coded encryption password, which makes the encryption easily reversible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker who is able to obtain access to encrypted database credentials using this method can decrypt them. This allows them to obtain access to the database which could provide access to sensitive data stored by the application or allow for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker needs to have access to the system or the files where the encrypted credentials are stored in order to perform decryption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have some form of authenticated access to the application or the ability to obtain the encrypted database credentials.
