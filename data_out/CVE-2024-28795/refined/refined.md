- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers, leading to actions such as session hijacking or unauthorized information access.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by malicious input being stored and later rendered in the web interface, allowing the attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts which are then stored by the application.
