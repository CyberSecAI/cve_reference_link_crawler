Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-25765:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of URLs provided as input to the `pdfkit` Ruby gem. Specifically, user-controlled input within URLs is not correctly sanitized before being passed to the `wkhtmltopdf` command-line tool, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is a command injection vulnerability. By injecting shell metacharacters and command substitution sequences within a URL, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the `pdfkit` gem is used, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
- **Data Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The Snyk report indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as a successful attack could allow the attacker to steal sensitive data, modify system files, and disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Input:** The attack vector is through the URL provided as input to the `PDFKit.new()` constructor. Specifically, if the application includes user-supplied data in the URL (e.g., via query parameters), it becomes vulnerable.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is also exploitable if the attacker controls the entire URL argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Control URL Input:** The attacker must be able to influence or control the URL being passed to `pdfkit`, typically through user-provided input like query parameters.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability does not require any prior authentication, making it easier to exploit.
- **Network Access:** The attack can be executed remotely over the network.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `pdfkit/pdfkit.rb` file, where the command to `wkhtmltopdf` is constructed. Specifically, the handling of the URL before passing it to `wkhtmltopdf` is not properly sanitized.
- The `source.rb` file also plays a role, as it is where the URL is being processed before being used to build the command line.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can inject shell commands using URL-encoded characters along with backticks to trigger command execution.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 0.8.7.2 of the `pdfkit` gem. Upgrading to this version or higher mitigates the vulnerability.
- The initial fix in 0.8.7 was incomplete, requiring a second fix in 0.8.7.2.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-78, which is Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection').
- The Snyk report provides a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical).
- Fedora has released updates to address this vulnerability in versions 35, 36, and 37.
