- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web interface of SCHNEIDER Elektronik's 700 series components allows unauthenticated users to download traffic captures. These captures may contain the credentials of administrative users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of authentication for traffic capture download
    - HTTP login resulting in credentials being transmitted in plain text
    - Potential exposure of administrative credentials in traffic captures
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to administrative user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the web interface of the affected Schneider device over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface and must trick an administrative user into logging in to the web interface while a packet capture is running.
