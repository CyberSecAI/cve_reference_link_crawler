  + roster: fix infinite loop marshaling lists of items
  + stream: errors are now unmarshaled correctly
  + xmpp: the Encode methods no longer sometimes duplicate the xmlns attribute
  + xmpp: stream errors are now unmarshaled and returned from `Serve` and during

    session negotiation
  + xmpp: XML tokens written directly to the session are now always flushed to the

    underlying connection when the token writer is closed
  + xmpp: stream feature parse functions can no longer read beyond the end of the

    feature element
  + xmpp: the resource binding feature was previously broken for server sessions.
  + xmpp: the "to" and "from" attributes on incoming streams are now verified and

    an error is returned if they change between stream restarts
  + xmpp: empty "from" attributes are now removed before marshaling so that a

    default value can be set (if applicable)

Fixed in:

v0.22.0
Assigned CVE:
[CVE-2024-46957](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46957)

Versions of `mellium.im/xmpp` prior to v0.22.0 matched IQ and other stanza
responses by ID without checking the stanza type.
This means that a presence stanza with the same ID as an IQ stanza could have
its body handed to the IQ handler as if it were a response to the IQ.

If combined with incorrectly generated predictable IDs and handlers that do not
verify the IQ type themselves this could lead to a malicious actor being able to
bypass server safety checks and respond to IQs that were sent to other clients
or the server by sending a message or presence that would not be rejected by the
server in the same way an IQ of type “result” or “error” would be.

The default ID generation in `mellium.im/xmpp` is believed to be immune to this
problem.
If you are generating your own IDs it is important to ensure that they are
unpredictable.
