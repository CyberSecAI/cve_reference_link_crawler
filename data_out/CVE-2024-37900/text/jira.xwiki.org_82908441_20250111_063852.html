#### Description

Hello,

My name is Diana. I work as a junior analyst in the Cybersecurity Threat Analysis group at Positive Technologies.

Our researcher has discovered a critical vulnerability in the XWiki product. We strive to inform you as soon as possible about the vulnerabilities we have identified so that you can take appropriate measures to fix your product and protect your customers' systems.

We have already prepared a detailed technical vulnerability research report.

Please indicate in which format it is more convenient and safer for you to communicate: by email or in the tasks section?

If the first option, then we expect it to be the email of the cybersecurity team or the developers of the XWiki product.
