## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# FooBox (Free and Premium) < 2.7.28 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Go to settings and change the "Specific CSS classes" field to 123"</script><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>alert(1) (Admins and editors are allowed to use JS in posts/pages/comments/etc, so the unfiltered\_html capability should be disallowed when testing for Stored XSS using such roles)
