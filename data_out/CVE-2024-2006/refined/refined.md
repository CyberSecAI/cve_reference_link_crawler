Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2006

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of user-supplied data within the `outpost_shortcode_metabox_markup` function of the "Post Grid, Slider & Carousel Ultimate" WordPress plugin.  Specifically, the plugin was using `unserialize` on base64 decoded data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject PHP objects through the deserialization of untrusted data. The `outpost_shortcode_metabox_markup` function retrieves data from post meta, which, if not an array, is passed to a function that decodes a base64 string and then unserializes the data which allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP objects by crafting a serialized payload and storing in the post meta.
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The plugin directly unserializes data without proper validation or sanitization, creating an entry point for malicious object injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a suitable POP (Property Oriented Programming) chain is present in the WordPress instance (via other plugins or the theme), successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers may be able to delete files on the server
*   **Retrieval of Sensitive Data:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information from the server's file system or database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the `outpost_shortcode_metabox_markup` function of the plugin which handles the display of the settings metabox.
*  The malicious serialized PHP object can be injected into the post meta table, and when the function attempts to `unserialize` the data, it leads to the object injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This implies the attacker needs a valid user account on the target system with the specified privileges.
*  **Knowledge of PHP Object Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious serialized PHP object payload that can be injected.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is present in `includes/classes/metabox.php` and other files of the plugin.
*   The fix involves replacing the `unserialize` and `base64_encode` implementation with json encoding and decoding. This avoids the use of `unserialize` entirely and prevents PHP object injection.
*   The patched version of the plugin is 1.6.8.
