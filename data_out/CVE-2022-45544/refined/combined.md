# Free CMS & Blog for Website Creators

SCHLIX CMS is a high performance, multi-site content management system that allows users to build websites and blogs with ease. It's open, extensible, scalable and able to handle high load traffic. SCHLIX CMS has an intuitive and easy to use interface that will save you time and help to accomplish more with your site. It's very easy to install and is [readily available](/html/services.html) for you to use in many cloud and shared web hosting providers.

 [Feature list](/html/features.html)

![SCHLIX CMS Interface](/web/schlix/media/images/screenshots/schlix_cms_v22_screenshot_main.jpg)

### Open and Customizable

As a platform, SCHLIX CMS is designer and developer friendly. Whether it's the theme stylesheet, view template or custom code, you can override virtually anything in your sub-site without modifying its core. SCHLIX CMS also integrates well with Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation CSS framework, reducing the time necessary for a designer to create a responsive website.

For developers, our [open API](/api/ "API") provides database abstraction, user management, granular permission, search engine friendly URLs, caching, template, theme and so much more. The robust capabilities allows you to focus on developing your application without having to worry about those things.

### Extensible

Want to build an online magazine, a corporate website, a university/college website integrated with PeopleSoft®, online directory with search system, or custom web application? With its extensible scaffolding system, SCHLIX CMS allows you to do so with ease while writing less code. You can extend the software’s functionalities and create your own extensions with [SCHLIX Plugin Creator](/extensions/development/plugin-creator.html).

### Granular Access Control

SCHLIX CMS access control list system permits specific control over the user groups. You can designate who has access to parts of your site and allow centralized administration of access settings.

### Search Engine Friendly

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is mandatory on any website. The SCHLIX CMS is search engine friendly and easy to use. The built-in XML sitemap generator allows for easy website submission to Google, Bing, or Yahoo. All tags, keywords, content and URLs can be targeted to any languages:

![CMS Sample](/web/schlix/media/images/screenshots/schlix_sample_6.jpg)

### Built with security in mind

We understand digital and web security is critical. We write code that is better and more secure so our customers who use SCHLIX CMS feel confident they are protected. Updates are delivered quickly, and systems are updated in a single click with the auto updater without any worry of overwriting any custom modifications.

### Plenty of support

We'll give you the support you need to build your website. You can visit our forum and ask questions, or you can contact us for prioritized service. We are here to support you.
