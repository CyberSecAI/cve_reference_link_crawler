  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `eael_ext_toc_title_tag` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vector": "The attack is carried out by injecting malicious code into the `eael_ext_toc_title_tag` parameter, which is then stored in the database and rendered on the website. This is typically done through the WordPress admin panel.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher to modify the vulnerable settings."
