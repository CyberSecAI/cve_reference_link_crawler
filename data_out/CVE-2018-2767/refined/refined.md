Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-2767:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper enforcement of SSL/TLS usage within the `libmysqld` library of MySQL. Specifically, the content refers to it as "use of SSL/TLS not enforced in libmysqld (Return of BACKRONYM)"

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent SSL/TLS enforcement:** The core issue is that the library does not consistently enforce the use of SSL/TLS for connections, which could allow for unencrypted communication where it should be encrypted.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** The primary risk is the potential for data exposure as communication intended to be encrypted can occur in plaintext when SSL/TLS is not correctly enforced.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting unencrypted traffic if the server is not forcing SSL/TLS.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the MySQL client and server to intercept and potentially modify the traffic.
*   **No authentication required:** Some of the content indicates that this vulnerability could potentially be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Multiple Patches:** This vulnerability is addressed in various updates, including Ubuntu Security Notices (USN-3725-1, USN-3725-2), Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA-2018:2439, RHSA-2018:2729), Debian Security Advisory (DSA-4341-1) and Debian LTS advisory (DLA 1566-1), and the Oracle Critical Patch Update - July 2018.
*   **MySQL Versions Affected:** The vulnerability impacts various versions of MySQL, including 5.5.x, 5.6.x, and 5.7.x. Specific fixed versions are mentioned in the content (e.g., 5.5.61, 5.7.23, 5.5.62).
*   **MariaDB Impacted:** Some of the content indicates that MariaDB is also affected by this vulnerability, as it is a fork of MySQL.

In summary, CVE-2018-2767 is a flaw in MySQL's `libmysqld` library which could lead to data exposure due to inconsistent SSL/TLS enforcement. It is a network based attack vector, requiring an attacker to be able to intercept the traffic between client and server.
