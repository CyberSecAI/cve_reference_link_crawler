Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3923

**Description:**

*   The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the Beaver Builder WordPress plugin.
*   It affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.8.1.1.

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the plugin. Specifically, the `link_target` parameter is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize the `link_target` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly clean user-provided input before storing it in the database.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly encode user-provided input when it is displayed in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages built with the Beaver Builder plugin.
*   The malicious scripts execute when a user accesses the compromised page.
*   This allows an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies/session tokens, redirecting to malicious websites, defacing content, or other malicious activities within the context of a user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker leverages the `link_target` parameter when creating or editing a button element.
*   The malicious payload is stored in the database and rendered on the frontend for all users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level access on the WordPress site.
*   **Access to Beaver Builder Interface:** The attacker needs to have permissions to use the Beaver Builder plugin interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by wesley (wcraft) and published on May 7, 2024.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `frontend.php` file of the button module within the plugin (`/beaver-builder-lite-version/tags/2.8.0.7/modules/button/includes/frontend.php`, line 14).
*   The fix involves updating to version 2.8.1.2 of the plugin or any later patched version.
