| Hi,  I would like to report other potential vulnerabilities in the current version of RT-Thread. Please let me know if you plan to ask for a CVE ID in case the vulnerabilities are confirmed. I'm available if you need further clarifications. Potential heap buffer overflows in RT-Thread finshSummary I spotted some potential heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities at the following locations in the RT-Thread finsh source code: <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/finsh/msh_file.c#L346> <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/finsh/msh_file.c#L865> <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/finsh/msh.c#L654> Details Unbounded `rt_sprintf()` in the `directory_delete_for_msh()` function could lead to a heap buffer overflow at the marked line:  ``` static void directory_delete_for_msh(const char *pathname, char f, char v) {     DIR *dir = NULL;     struct dirent *dirent = NULL;     char *full_path;      if (pathname == RT_NULL)         return;      full_path = (char *)rt_malloc(DFS_PATH_MAX);     if (full_path == RT_NULL)         return;      dir = opendir(pathname);     if (dir == RT_NULL)     {         if (f == 0)         {             rt_kprintf("cannot remove '%s'\n", pathname);         }         rt_free(full_path);         return;     }      while (1)     {         dirent = readdir(dir);         if (dirent == RT_NULL)             break;         if (rt_strcmp(".", dirent->d_name) != 0 &&                 rt_strcmp("..", dirent->d_name) != 0)         {             rt_sprintf(full_path, "%s/%s", pathname, dirent->d_name); /* VULN: full_path is DFS_PATH_MAX bytes (only 256 bytes), potentially not enough to accommodate pathname + dirent->d_name */             if (dirent->d_type != DT_DIR)             {                 if (unlink(full_path) != 0)                 {                     if (f == 0)                         rt_kprintf("cannot remove '%s'\n", full_path);                 }                 else if (v)                 {                     rt_kprintf("removed '%s'\n", full_path);                 }             }             else             {                 directory_delete_for_msh(full_path, f, v);             }         }     }     closedir(dir);     rt_free(full_path);     if (rmdir(pathname) != 0)     {         if (f == 0)             rt_kprintf("cannot remove '%s'\n", pathname);     }     else if (v)     {         rt_kprintf("removed directory '%s'\n", pathname);     } } ```  Unbounded `rt_sprintf()` in the `directory_setattr()` function could lead to a heap buffer overflow at the marked line:  ``` static void directory_setattr(const char *pathname, struct dfs_attr *attr, char f, char v) {     DIR *dir = NULL;

                    }                 }                 else if (v)                 {                     rt_kprintf("'%s' setattr 0x%X\n", full_path, attr->st_mode);                 }             }             else if (dirent->d_type == DT_DIR)             {                 directory_setattr(full_path, attr, f, v);

| Hi, it's been one month since I reported this vulnerability, and I wanted to ask if you have any update. As standard practice, I plan to request a CVE ID for every confirmed vulnerability. I also intend to publish an advisory by February at the latest, unless there's a specific reason to postpone. Thanks! |
