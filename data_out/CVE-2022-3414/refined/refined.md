- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application constructs an SQL command using externally influenced input from the `txtusername` parameter in the `/Admin/login.php` file without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data (confidentiality), modification of data (integrity), or denial of service (availability).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted input to the `txtusername` parameter in the `/Admin/login.php` file via an HTTP POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
