- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FortiGate firewall fails to log traffic to certain Fortinet-owned IP addresses when fabric/fortiheartbeat/endpoint-compliance is enabled at the interface level.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control. The firewall fails to record traffic destined to specific subnets (173.243.128.0/20 and 96.45.32.0/20) when certain features are enabled. This is a logging issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The primary impact is that traffic to specific Fortinet-owned IP addresses might not be logged, making it difficult to monitor or troubleshoot network activity related to those addresses. For example, traffic generated by FortiClient/FortiClient EMS for update requests might not be logged.
- **Attack vectors**: The issue is triggered by enabling specific features (fabric/fortiheartbeat/endpoint-compliance) on the FortiGate interface. It does not involve a direct attack, rather it is a configuration-related issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities are required, this issue affects systems when the described features are enabled. An attacker does not need to be in a special position to cause this issue.
