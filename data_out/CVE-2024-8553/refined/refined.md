These macros may allow an authenticated user with permissions to view and create templates to read any field from Foreman's database. By using specific strings in the loader macros, users can bypass permissions and access sensitive information.",

These allow an authenticated user having permission to view any of the resources which have loader macros and permissions to view and create (probably) any kind of templates that allows this user to read any field from Foreman's database by passing in strings to the loader macros and remapping fields from the result to the original object class.",
