| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2312524#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-09-16 07:39:15 UTC  ``` An issue in templates related to loader macros which were introduced together with report templates. These allow an authenticated user having permission to view any of the resources which have loader macros and permissions to view and create (probably) any kind of templates that allows this user to read any field from Foreman's database by passing in strings to the loader macros and remapping fields from the result to the original object class.
