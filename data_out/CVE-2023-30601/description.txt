Privilege escalation when enabling FQL/Audit logs allows user with JMX access to run arbitrary commands as the user running Apache Cassandra
This issue affects Apache Cassandra: from 4.0.0 through 4.0.9, from 4.1.0 through 4.1.1.

WORKAROUND
The vulnerability requires nodetool/JMX access to be exploitable, disable access for any non-trusted users.

MITIGATION
Upgrade to 4.0.10 or 4.1.2 and leave the new FQL/Auditlog configuration propertyÂ allow_nodetool_archive_command as false.
