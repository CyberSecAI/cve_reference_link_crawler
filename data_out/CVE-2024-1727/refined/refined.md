The provided content is related to a commit that tightens CORS rules in the `gradio` project. This commit is likely related to a security vulnerability where the previous CORS implementation was too permissive.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The previous CORS implementation in `gradio` was overly permissive, allowing requests from any origin. This could potentially expose the application to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks or other malicious activities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The original implementation of CORS middleware used `allow_origins=["*"]`, which allows any origin to access the API. This was overly permissive.
- The lack of strict origin validation allowed cross-origin requests, which could be used by malicious actors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks where a malicious site could make requests to the Gradio application on behalf of a logged-in user.
- Potential for information disclosure if the application logic did not properly protect sensitive data.
- Other potential vulnerabilities that might arise from less strict CORS policies, such as malicious embedding within third party sites and API misuse.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending requests from a malicious webpage to the Gradio application using Javascript
- Embedding a Gradio application in a malicious context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control a webpage that can make HTTP requests, or to insert the application into a malicious context
- The attacker needs to know the URL of the Gradio application and endpoints.

**Changes introduced by the commit:**
The commit introduces a `CustomCORSMiddleware` to tighten the CORS rules.

- The middleware now checks the `host` and `origin` headers of incoming requests.
- It defines a list of `localhost_aliases` (e.g. "localhost", "127.0.0.1", "0.0.0.0", "null") that are considered local.
- If a request is from a local host and has a non-local origin, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is not set, effectively blocking cross-origin requests.
- For other cases, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is set to the value of the `origin` header.
- Additionally the middleware sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to allow the standard HTTP methods and headers.
- The standard CORS middleware is removed and the custom one is added.

These changes prevent cross-origin requests when the Gradio application is running locally.
This commit also includes changes to the test suite to verify that the new CORS implementation works as expected.
