- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Add Shortcodes Actions And Filters plugin, in versions 2.0.9 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially execute unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force a higher-privileged user to perform unintended actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or other malicious outcomes. The specific impact depends on the actions the plugin allows to be performed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request that is sent to the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into executing the crafted request (e.g., by tricking the user into clicking a link). The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
