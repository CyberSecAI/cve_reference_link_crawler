This vulnerability is due to insufficient rate-limiting of TCP connections to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of TCP packets to the Device Console UI. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the Device Console UI process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. A manual reload of the fabric interconnect is needed to restore complete functionality.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucsfi-imm-syn-p6kZTDQC>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco UCS 6400 and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects when they were in IMM and were running a vulnerable release of the Management Package.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the Device Configuration To determine which release of Cisco IMM Management Package is running on the device, use the **show version** command at the device CLI, as shown in the following example:  ```   6500-FI# show versionDevice Connector Version: 1.0.11-9999Management Package Version: 1.0.11-1970   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects that are in UCSM Managed Mode.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases For customers who are using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) version of Intersight, the Management Package is automatically updated on claimed devices, so no user action is required. For customers who are using Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance, the Management Package is updated following an update of the virtual appliance.  At the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.       | Cisco IMM Management Package Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 1.0.11 and earlier | 1.0.11-1582 |   | 1.0.11-1583 | Not vulnerable |       **Note:** To determine which release of Cisco IMM Management Package is running on the device, use the **show version** command at the device CLI.  The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.
