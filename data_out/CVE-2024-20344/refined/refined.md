- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient rate-limiting of TCP connections to the Device Console UI of Cisco UCS 6400 and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects in Intersight Managed Mode (IMM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of proper rate-limiting on TCP connections.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the Device Console UI process, requiring a manual reload of the fabric interconnect to restore full functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a high number of TCP packets to the Device Console UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to send network packets to the affected device.
