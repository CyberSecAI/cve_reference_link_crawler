The provided content relates to CVE-2018-25098.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `executeUcacTx` function in the Credit Protocol contract was inexpensive and unauthenticated, allowing anyone to call it and increment the transaction counter of a UCAC without performing a real transaction, up to the UCAC's limit.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated function: The `executeUcacTx` function lacked authentication, making it accessible to any user.
- Inexpensive operation: The function's operation was computationally inexpensive for an attacker to repeatedly trigger.
- Transaction counter manipulation:  The function allowed manipulation of the UCAC transaction counter without real transactions taking place.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A motivated attacker could repeatedly call the `executeUcacTx` function to exhaust a UCAC's transaction limit, preventing legitimate transactions using that UCAC from being processed.
- Resource exhaustion: By incrementing the transaction counter, the attacker can effectively make a UCAC unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Calling the `executeUcacTx` function repeatedly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to call the smart contract, no special privileges are required.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by changing the visibility of the `executeUcacTx` function from `public` to `private`. This prevents external users from directly calling it, and it can only be called by other internal functions of the contract.
