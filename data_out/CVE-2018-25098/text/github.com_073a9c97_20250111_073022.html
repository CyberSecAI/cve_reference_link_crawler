ðŸ”’ Fix DoS vulnerability in Credit Protocol contract

```
`#executeUcacTx` is an inexpensive and unauthenticated function that
increases the transaction counter for a UCAC without actually
performing a transaction, up to that UCAC's transaction limit.

A motivated attacker can call this function continuously to perform
a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on a UCAC, preventing legitimate
transactions using that UCAC from being processed.

Once started, this attack can be maintained indefinitely.

Potential mitigations/effects on a live contract include:

 * An attack on a UCAC may incentivize its stakeholders to unstake
   their tokens.

 * The fewer tokens staked in a UCAC, the less expensive the attack
   becomes to perform and maintain.

 * Staking more tokens in the UCAC will increase the transaction limit,
   thus increasing the cost to perform and maintain the attack.

The best mitigation for this attack, then, for a live contract, would
be for token holders to stake enough tokens in the affected UCAC to
make the attack too expensive for the attacker to maintain.
