- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server session is not fully terminated during an explicit sign-out.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incomplete server termination during explicit sign-out.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Low impact on confidentiality and integrity, no impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges required but user interaction is required. The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to exploit the vulnerability.
