Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by the direct insertion of user-supplied values into the generated HTML page without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the `PageRenderHtmlByAlias` function in `PageBuildHtml.go` takes an alias parameter from the URL path and includes it directly into the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
- Lack of input sanitization or escaping before rendering HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the alias parameter.
- The injected scripts will be executed in the user's browser.
- This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can manipulate the URL path to include malicious scripts within the alias parameter.
- The `FrontendHandlerRenderAsString` function in `FrontendHandler.go` passes the URL path directly to the vulnerable `PageRenderHtmlByAlias` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious alias.
- No specific authentication or privileges are explicitly mentioned. The vulnerability lies in how the application handles URL parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by user `gtqbhksl` and reported in issue #5 on the gouniverse/cms repository.
- The vulnerable code is located in `FrontendHandler.go` (line 33-52) and `PageBuildHtml.go` (line 10-22).
- The vulnerability has been fixed by `lesichkovm`.
- The fix involves proper encoding of the alias parameter before being rendered into the HTML, as seen by the changes in the commit `3e661cdfb4beeb9fe2ad507cdb8104c0b17d072c` where the return statements now use `hb.NewDiv().Text(..).ToHTML()` instead of direct string concatenation.
- The issue is also tracked in golang/vulndb#3125.
- The vulnerable version is 1.4.0 and the fix is available in version 1.4.1.
