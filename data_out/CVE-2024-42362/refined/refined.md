{
  "CVE-2024-42362": {
    "status": "RELATED",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application uses SnakeYaml's `loadAs` method to deserialize user-provided YAML configurations without proper sanitization, leading to unsafe deserialization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsafe deserialization",
          "Inadequate input validation",
        "Insufficient block lists for risky tokens"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible by exploiting the unsafe deserialization vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a malicious YAML payload via the `/api/apps/define/yml` endpoint.",
         "Sending a malicious YAML file via the `/api/monitors/import` endpoint."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated with at least guest role to exploit the `/api/apps/define/yml` and user role for `/api/monitors/import`."
    },
        "remediation": "The vulnerability was addressed by adding a more comprehensive block list of risky tokens and using a safe constructor to initialize SnakeYaml. Additionally, the application was upgraded to use Springboot 3.0 and Java 17"
  }
