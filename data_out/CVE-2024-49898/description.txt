In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check null-initialized variables

[WHAT & HOW]
drr_timing and subvp_pipe are initialized to null and they are not
always assigned new values. It is necessary to check for null before
dereferencing.

This fixes 2 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.
