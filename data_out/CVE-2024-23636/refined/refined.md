Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-23636

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in a bypass of the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism. SOFARPC uses the SOFA Hessian protocol for deserializing data, and it implements a blacklist to prevent deserialization of dangerous classes. However, a specific gadget chain, relying only on JDK classes, can circumvent this blacklist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary weakness is the vulnerable deserialization process in SOFARPC that allows an attacker to bypass the blacklist.
- **Insufficient Blacklist:** The existing blacklist was not comprehensive enough to prevent the identified attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation can lead to remote command execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited via network communication using the SOFA Hessian protocol.
- **Deserialization:** The attack vector involves sending malicious data that, when deserialized, triggers the vulnerable gadget chain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to a SOFARPC server using the SOFA Hessian protocol.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the specific gadget chain that bypasses the blacklist.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was implemented by adding a new blacklist in version 5.12.0.
- A workaround was provided which allows adding additional blacklisted classes using the `rpc_serialize_blacklist_override` property.
- The severity is considered low despite the potential for RCE.
- The vulnerable versions are < 5.11.1 and the patched version is 5.12.0.
