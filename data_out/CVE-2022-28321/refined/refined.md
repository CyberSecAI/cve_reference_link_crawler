Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation in the `pam_access.so` module of the Linux-PAM package. Specifically, the module fails to properly restrict access when a user attempts to log in from an IP address that cannot be resolved via DNS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is that the `pam_access.so` module does not correctly enforce access restrictions when a user's IP address is not resolvable via DNS. This bypasses intended access controls.
*   **Incorrect Address Resolution:** The core issue lies in how `pam_access.so` handles IP addresses. It uses `getaddrinfo` with the string of the provided IP, which will fail if the IP has no DNS entry and therefore will not match any access control entry. The fix uses `getaddrinfo` with `tok`, which contains the original string from the configuration.
*   **Missing Validation:** The module lacks proper validation or fallback mechanisms to handle cases where reverse DNS lookups fail.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to systems even if their IP address is explicitly denied in the `/etc/security/access.conf` configuration, provided their IP is not resolvable via DNS.
*   **Security Policy Violation:** The vulnerability allows a bypass of configured security policies, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **Critical Severity:** SUSE rates the issue as having critical severity, meaning it could have significant repercussions to the systems impacted by this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting SSH login attempts.
*   **Unresolvable IP:** The attacker must connect from a machine with an IP address that cannot be resolved via DNS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the targeted system, typically via SSH.
*   **Blocked IP Address:** The attacker's IP address needs to be explicitly denied in the target system's access control configuration (`/etc/security/access.conf`).
*  **Non-resolvable IP address:** The attacker must use a non-resolvable IP address (not defined in DNS).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is primarily relevant to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory.
*   The issue is fixed in `linux-pam` version 1.5.2-6.1 and later in affected SUSE products.
*   The fix includes using `getaddrinfo(tok, ...)` instead of `getaddrinfo(string, ...)` to correctly handle IP addresses that are not resolvable via DNS.
*   The fix also addresses two memory leaks in the original code.
*   SUSE Bugzilla entry 1197654 tracks this issue.
*  The fix was also contributed upstream via pull request [linux-pam/linux-pam#447](https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/pull/447).
* The vulnerability was introduced by a previous patch to address [bsc#1019866](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1019866)
