# CVE-2022-28321

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2022-28289.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2022-28327.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2022-28321 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28321)

#### Description

The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows authentication bypass for SSH logins. The pam\_access.so module doesn't correctly restrict login if a user tries to connect from an IP address that is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a user with denied access to a machine can still get access. NOTE: the relevance of this issue is largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory; it does not affect Linux-PAM upstream.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1197654#c0)  Thomas Leroy   2022-03-29 15:07:08 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1197021](show_bug.cgi?id=1197021 "RESOLVED FIXED") +++  From: Thorsten Kukuk  when trying to push upstream an old patch from Josef Moellers for pam_access.so, I run into a severe issue:  pam contains a patch pam-hostnames-in-access_conf.patch for [bsc#1019866](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1019866)  In short: "-:root:ALL EXCEPT localhost" does not work beside it is documented as valid entry.  I tested the patch by using an openSUSE Tumbleweed VM, created test user "test0" and used the following line in /etc/security/access.conf:  "-:test0:ALL EXCEPT 127.0.0.1"  I tried to login (ssh -l test0 <IP of VM> from the virtualisation host: 1. tested with our patch: I could login! 2. tested without our patch: the attemp got correctly blocked  It looks like the patch has a problem if you login from an IP address which is not resolveable via DNS. You can login even if not permitted.  I only tested the patch we have in Tumbleweed. Since the patch got modified 2020 by Josef, I have no idea if the problem is new or if it exists already in the old patch. Which also had already a security problem: [bsc#1115640](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1115640), use-correct-IP-address.patch, CVE-2018-17953  The problem seems to be the getaddrinfo (string, ...) around line 800, this must be most likely getaddrinfo (tok, ...). With this change, this case works for me. But I cannot do a full validation of all variants.  ======  a fixed patch (which also fixes two memory leaks) can be found here:  <https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/pull/447>  With this version it looks like as if you cannot login anymore if your IP is blocked. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1197654#c11)  Thomas Leroy   2022-03-30 09:10:08 UTC  ``` Great, thanks guys!  I notice that SUSE:SLE-15:Update shipped the buggy patch without the fixing use-correct-IP-address.patch in revision 1. R2 fixed this 3 years ago.  SUSE:SLE-12:Update and SUSE:SLE-11-SP2:Update have never got the buggy patch.  To sum-up, openSUSE:Factory got the fix 2 weeks ago, Leap and SLE15 were vulnerable between r1 and r2 3 years ago. So we're fine ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1197654#c12)  Thomas Leroy   2022-05-06 09:18:22 UTC  ``` Still waiting for a CVE to be assigned. Closing anyway since everything is fixed. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1197654#c13)  Thomas Leroy   2022-05-13 06:08:51 UTC  ``` CVE-2022-28321 was assigned. ``` |  |
