## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Flaming Forms <= 1.0.1 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against administrators.

### Proof of Concept

1. As an admin, add a contact form
2. As an unauthenticated user, enter the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>` for any of the contact form fields and submit
3. As an admin, view the form submissions and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
