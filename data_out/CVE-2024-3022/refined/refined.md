Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3022

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient filename validation in the `bookingpress_process_upload` function. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the plugin does not properly sanitize file names before processing them, allowing for malicious file extensions to bypass security checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload files of any type, including those that can be executed on the server.
- **Inadequate Filename Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't adequately sanitize filenames, failing to prevent the upload of files that can be executed by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full control over the website and server. This allows for a range of malicious activities, including data theft, website defacement, and further compromise of the server and connected networks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Exploitation occurs through web requests to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **File Upload Functionality:** The specific attack vector is the plugin's file upload mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator or a user with equivalent capabilities to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Plugin User Interface:** The attacker needs to interact with the plugin's interface to trigger the file upload functionality.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in BookingPress plugin versions up to and including 1.0.87.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.0.88 by sanitizing the file names before processing them, preventing malicious extensions from being used.
- The provided changeset highlights the modifications that were made to `bookingpress_fileupload_class.php` to address the vulnerability. Specifically, `sanitize_file_name()` function was introduced to handle the filename sanitization.
- The patch also added additional checks to prevent the upload of files that contain PHP code within them by performing checks for php short tags.
