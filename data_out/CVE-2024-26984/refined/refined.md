Instead they include details on a race condition fix in the Nouveau driver which is not related to CVE-2024-26984. The race condition occurs in the `nv50_instobj_acquire` function and can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash. The fix involves adding memory barriers to ensure correct ordering of operations when multiple threads access the function."
