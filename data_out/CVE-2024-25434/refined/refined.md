Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the "public name" field within the Contributor Component of the application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. This occurs because the provided payload is saved within the system. When a user later accesses the affected area of the application, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Data theft:** Extracting sensitive information from the application or the user's browser.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting the user to a malicious site.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the application interface.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Injecting malicious scripts that lead to downloads of malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Input Field:** The attack vector is the "public name" input field within the Contributor Component.
*   **Stored:** The XSS payload is stored in the application's database, ensuring the code is executed each time the affected data is viewed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the rights to access the "Contributor Component" and modify the "public name" field. The provided content indicates an admin level account is required.
*   **Knowledge of Input Field:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable input field.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Product:** The affected product is identified as OJS 3.3.
*   **Payload Example:**  The document specifies the payload `<img src=a onerror=alert(1)>` that triggers the XSS.
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** A Google Drive link is provided (though inaccessible in this context), suggesting a video or visual demonstration of the vulnerability.
