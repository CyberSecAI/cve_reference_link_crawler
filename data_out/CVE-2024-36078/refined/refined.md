- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Ruby gem bundled with Zammad was installed with world-writable file permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** World-writable file permissions on a bundled Ruby gem. This allows any local user on the system to modify the gem's files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker could inject arbitrary code into the Zammad processes by modifying the gem's files. This code would then be executed with the same privileges as the Zammad user.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the Zammad server and the ability to write to the affected gem's files.
