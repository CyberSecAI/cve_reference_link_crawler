Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control in the FortiEDR Manager API. Specifically, an authenticated administrator with REST API permissions, restricted to a specific organization in a shared environment, could access backend logs. This access should have been limited to their own organization but was not correctly enforced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-284:** Improper Access Control. The vulnerability lies in the failure to properly enforce access controls within the FortiEDR Manager API, specifically when handling backend logs in shared environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with the specified privileges could access backend logs that contain sensitive information related to other organizations within the shared environment. This includes the potential to view configurations, settings, and other metadata not intended for them.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited via network requests to the FortiEDR Manager API, using the REST API.
*   The attacker must be an authenticated administrator that has API access permissions on a specific organization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Admin:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials within the FortiEDR system.
*   **REST API Permissions:** The admin user must have REST API access permissions.
*   **Shared Environment:** The vulnerable system must be deployed within a shared environment context where multiple organizations are present.
*   **Organization membership:** The attacker must be an administrator for an organization in the shared environment.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects FortiEDR Manager versions 6.0 (all versions) and 6.2.0 through 6.2.1.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in FortiEDR Manager 6.2.2 and later. Users of 6.0 should migrate to a fixed release.
*   Fortinet has also fixed this issue at the configuration level on all shared environments they maintain.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSSv3 score of 4.6.
