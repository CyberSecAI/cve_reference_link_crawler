- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in a detection mechanism within the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent on Windows allows a local, non-administrative user to disable the agent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions (CWE-754). Specifically, a detection mechanism failure allows a non-admin user to disable the agent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disable the Cortex XDR agent, potentially allowing them to perform malicious activities without the agent's protection. This leads to high impact on availability, as it disables the security product itself.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a non-administrative user account on the target Windows machine, and be able to execute programs locally.
