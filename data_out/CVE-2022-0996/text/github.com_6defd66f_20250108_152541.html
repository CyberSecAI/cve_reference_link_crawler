| **Issue Description**  An LDAP client can bind to DS, and even if an error 49 (expired password) is returned, the session is still "authenticated" and the user can proceed as "normal". When the user's password is fully expired (grace logins used up) the user needs to be considered anonymous (not authenticated). |
