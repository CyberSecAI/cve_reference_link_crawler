- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromSetWifiGusetBasic` function within the Tenda AC7 V1.0 firmware. Specifically, the `shareSpeed` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided information does not specify the impact but a stack buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `shareSpeed` parameter in the `fromSetWifiGusetBasic` function. The specific protocol or method to access the vulnerable function is not specified, but given the context of the device it is likely an HTTP request to the device's web interface.
   
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable device targeting the `fromSetWifiGusetBasic` function with a malformed `shareSpeed` parameter. Network access to the device is required.
