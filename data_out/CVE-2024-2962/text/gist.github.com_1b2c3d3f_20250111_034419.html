 [Raw](/Xib3rR4dAr/f5f5d07263fdac28b6e9ba2f6c4e4523/raw/ce6e9623be573390c1f7a16f7ca698e830250779/WP_theme_Networker__Improper-Access-Control-Allowing-Unauthenticated-Modification-of-Display-location-of-any-menu.md)

[**WP\_theme\_Networker\_\_Improper-Access-Control-Allowing-Unauthenticated-Modification-of-Display-location-of-any-menu.md**](#file-wp_theme_networker__improper-access-control-allowing-unauthenticated-modification-of-display-location-of-any-menu-md)

# WordPress Networker theme <= 1.1.9 - Improper Access Control Allowing Unauthenticated Modification of Display location of any menu

| Exploit Title | WordPress Networker theme <= 1.1.9 - Improper Access Control Allowing Unauthenticated Modification of Display location of any menu |
| --- | --- |
| Exploit Author | Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr) |
| Date | January 26, 2024 |
| Theme Link | <https://themeforest.net/item/networker-tech-news-wordpress-theme-with-dark-mode/28749988> |
| Version | 1.1.9 (latest version at time of vulnerability discovery) |
| Tested on | Wordpress 6.4.3 |
| Vulnerable Endpoint | /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=csco\_reload\_menu |
| Vulnerable File | networker/inc/mega-menu.php#L86 |
| CVE | Not assigned yet |

### Fix

Remove following from line 86 of `wp-content/themes/networker/inc/mega-menu.php` so that action is not accessible without authentication.

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_csco_reload_menu', array( $this, 'admin_reload_nav_menu' ) );

```
