- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Futurio Extra plugin, versions 2.0.11 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), a type of injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack allows a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts are executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to various malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**  A malicious actor injects malicious scripts into the website, which are then executed when other users visit the affected pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the website. The required privilege to exploit this vulnerability is listed as "Contributor," which suggests an attacker with some level of access to the website's content or configuration can leverage it.
