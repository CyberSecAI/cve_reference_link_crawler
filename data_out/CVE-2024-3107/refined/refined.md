Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3107

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the `get_block_default_attributes` function of the Spectra WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or restrict the paths it uses when accessing files, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory. This allows access to files on the server named `attributes.php` .

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read the contents of arbitrary `attributes.php` files. These files can potentially contain sensitive information, potentially including API keys, database credentials or other sensitive configuration data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is conducted over the network, likely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have at least Contributor-level permissions to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests that a user account with the ability to create or modify content is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Spectra plugin up to and including 2.12.6.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.12.7.
- The vulnerable code is located in `class-uagb-block-module.php`, specifically in how the plugin handles the inclusion of `attributes.php` files for blocks.
