Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the absence of `Delegate=true` in the systemd unit files generated by `snapd` for container management snaps. This omission caused systemd to manage the control groups (cgroups) of container processes instead of allowing the container management daemons (e.g., dockerd) to do so. When systemd reloads (due to various events like `systemctl daemon-reload` or package upgrades), it could move the container's cgroups back into the same cgroup as the parent process (the container daemon). This action effectively elevates the privileges of the container processes to that of the container management daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing `Delegate=true`:** The core issue is the missing `Delegate=true` directive in the systemd unit files for container management snaps.
*   **Incorrect Cgroup Management:**  Systemd incorrectly manages the cgroups for containerized processes when `Delegate=true` is absent. This leads to a misconfiguration.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Containers lose their intended isolation and inherit the privileges of the container management daemon.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious or compromised container can gain access to the host system's devices, including the filesystem, due to the lack of proper cgroup isolation.
*   **Full Host Compromise:**  The vulnerability allows the container to escape its confinement and potentially achieve full control of the host system, leading to arbitrary read/write access to any device on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Container Image:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using a malicious container image that contains exploit code.
*   **Compromised Container:** An already running, compromised container can take advantage of this vulnerability.
*   **Systemd Reload:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a systemd reload, which can occur through actions like:
    *   `systemctl daemon-reload`
    *   Unattended upgrades (package changes)
    *   Service unit changes
*   **Local Access**:  Attack is local as the attacker must have an already running container

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to run a container:** The attacker needs to have the capability to run a container on a system affected by this issue
*   **Control over a Container:** The attacker needs to have control over either a malicious or a compromised container.
*   **No specific privileges needed**: The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the host.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple container management snaps, including `docker`, `microk8s`, `aws-iot-greengrass` (1.8.x), and `kubernetes-worker`
*   The fix involves adding `Delegate=true` to the systemd unit files generated for these snaps.
*   The fix was included in `snapd` version `2.48.3`.
*   Affected snaps need to be refreshed to apply the fix, and this was done by having the snaps `assume` snapd version `2.48.3` or greater.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered spontaneously due to systemd reloads caused by unattended upgrades.
*   The CVSS vector is: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` with a base score of 10.0, later adjusted to 8.8 and finally to 10.0
