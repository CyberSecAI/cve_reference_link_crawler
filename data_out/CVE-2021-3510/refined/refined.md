- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zephyr JSON decoder incorrectly handles array of array structures when using `JSON_OBJ_DESCR_ARRAY_ARRAY`. The decoder assigns the subarray token type (`JSON_TOK_LIST_START`) to the object part of a union. Subsequently, `arr_parse` calculates an incorrect offset for the array-object and stores the subarray's length in a location meant for the name-pointer of the first element.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect parsing of nested arrays in the JSON decoder. Specifically, the length of the subarray is written to the wrong memory location, corrupting the object structure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The incorrect memory write can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or denial of service. The specific impact is not fully detailed in the provided text beyond the corruption of the object structure used to parse the json data. The CVSS score gives a high score for Availability due to the potential for a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) with low attack complexity (AC:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction (PR:N/UI:N) to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to provide a malicious json payload to the zephyr based system to exploit.
