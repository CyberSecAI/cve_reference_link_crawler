- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Infinera TNMS Server stores SNMP user passwords in its database and exported configuration files in a Base64 encoded format, which is easily reversible, instead of using proper encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information (SNMP usernames and passwords) in the database and exported configuration files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the database or exported configuration files can obtain SNMP user credentials in cleartext, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of network devices.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Direct access to the database tables.
    - Access to a database dump obtained from a previous data breach.
    - Access to exported configuration files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Requires local access to the server with privileges to view database contents or access exported configuration files.
    - Access to a compromised system containing the database dump or exported configuration files.
