  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `check_xshm()` function in Mesa's `drisw_glx.c` does not check the return value of `xcb_query_extension_reply()` before dereferencing it. `xcb_query_extension_reply()` can return `NULL` if the X11 connection has an error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A NULL pointer dereference can lead to a crash of the application or service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Triggering an error state in the X11 connection.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to influence the state of the X11 connection to trigger an error. The attacker needs to be able to cause the `xcb_wait_for_reply` to return NULL."
