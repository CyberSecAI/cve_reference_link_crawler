Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: High privilege users, such as administrators, can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. This can lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

Attack vectors: An attacker with administrative access can inject malicious JavaScript code into the widget's settings (e.g., width field).

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in the WordPress installation.
