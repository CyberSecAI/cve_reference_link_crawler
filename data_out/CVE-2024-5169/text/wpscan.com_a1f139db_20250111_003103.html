## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Video Widget <= 1.2.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Widget

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a "Video Widget" to a widget area
2. Add the payload `"><script>alert(2222)</script>` for the "width" value
3. Save and see the XSS
Note: other fields are likely vulnerable

### Affects Plugins
