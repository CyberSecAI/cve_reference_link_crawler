Before finding WPAdCenter I’ve tested several plugins to display simple image banners on my website and all of them had some issues or complicated / ugly interfaces compared to this plugin.
The plugin is easy to use and set up. The free version comes with a great amount of features and for smaller sites that’s more than enough.
Once I’ll need more functionality, I’d be happy to upgrade to the PRO version.
