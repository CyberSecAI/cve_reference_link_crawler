{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient filtering of the `img` tag in Zorlan SkyCaiji 2.8, allowing an attacker to bypass existing XSS protections using `eval(String.fromCharCode())` within the `onerror` attribute of the `img` tag.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This can lead to cookie theft, unauthorized command execution (if combined with a code injection vulnerability), and other malicious actions on behalf of the victim's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts malicious data on their own website, including an `img` tag with an `onerror` attribute containing a payload using `eval(String.fromCharCode())`. When a user creates a task in Zorlan SkyCaiji to collect data from this malicious website and previews the collected data, the injected JavaScript code is executed in the user's browser.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a website with the malicious payload. They also need to trick a victim user into using Zorlan SkyCaiji to create a collection task from the attacker-controlled website.  The attacker does not need prior access to the target application, but needs to trick a user of the application."
