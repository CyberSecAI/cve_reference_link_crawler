The provided content relates to CVE-2023-48300.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `show_all` attribute in the `embed_privacy_opt_out` shortcode of the Embed Privacy WordPress plugin was not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- The injected scripts execute when a user accesses the page, potentially leading to malicious actions on the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the `embed_privacy_opt_out` shortcode, by injecting malicious code into the `show_all` attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level permissions to create posts or pages.
- The attacker does not require any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, as it executes automatically when a user views the affected page.
