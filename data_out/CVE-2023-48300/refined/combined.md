# Missing escaping for show\_all attribute in opt-out shortcode

Moderate

[MatzeKitt](/MatzeKitt)
published
GHSA-3wv9-4rvf-w37g
Nov 19, 2023

## Package

Embed Privacy

## Affected versions

< 1.8.1

## Patched versions

1.8.1

## Description

### Impact

The `Embed Privacy` plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'embed\_privacy\_opt\_out' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Vulnerable File: embed-privacy/inc/class-embed-privacy.php

Line: 2153

POC Video: <https://d.pr/v/ORuIat>

(1) Install and activate the plugin as an administrator.

(2) As a contributor, create a post using the following shortcode:

[embed\_privacy\_opt\_out show\_all='xxx123" onmouseover=alert(1) foo="bar']

(3) When the administrator previews the post, and hovers the element, the XSS payload will execute.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
