  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2024-34507",
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way MediaWiki's CommentParser handles link markers in edit summaries. Specifically, the parser URL-decodes page titles, which allows an attacker to insert a \\x1B character (used as a marker) after these characters have been stripped. This can be used to insert a link marker within an HTML attribute, causing a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The edit summary parser does not properly sanitize or escape link markers, especially when they are introduced through URL-encoded characters.",
          "The parser replaces markers within HTML attributes which leads to breaking out of the attribute context and enables the execution of arbitrary javascript."
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into edit summaries, which will execute when a user views the history of that page. This allows for malicious actions such as stealing user session information, defacing pages, or performing other unauthorized operations within the user's session context.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted edit summaries that include specifically formatted links containing the \\x1B character. This is achieved by exploiting the URL decoding mechanism in the parser. A user must create an edit with a malicious edit summary, and another user viewing the history of the page will trigger the XSS.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or edit pages, and include malicious links in the edit summary"
