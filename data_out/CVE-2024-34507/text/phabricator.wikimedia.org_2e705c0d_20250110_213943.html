# Description

### Steps to reproduce:

* Create a page named PageThatExists
* On some other page (not PageThatExists), create an edit with the following edit summary: [[Special:RecentChanges#%1b0000000|link1]] [[PageThatExists#/autofocus/onfocus=alert("xss\n"+document.domain)//|link2]]
* View the history of that page. [This assumes that the edit you just made was the most recent edit to the page]
* An alert box pops up announcing the XSS.

### Suggested fix:

* Change marker syntax in MediaWiki\CommentFormatter\CommentParser to have " and ' in it like Parser does instead of being just \x1b

### Explanation:

This is similar to [T110143](/T110143)

During parsing, page titles get url decoded (It should be noted, that this doesn't work in all spots, because some things decode \x1b as the unicode replacement character, particularly entity decoders). This allows the attacker to insert an \x1B character after they were all stripped, and hence allows the attacker to insert a link marker. If a link marker is inserted inside an attribute.

Whether the link is directly inserted or if it uses a strip marker depends on if the link is in link cache. Additionally non existing links generally don't have a fragment (The actual page name is not allowed to have 0x1B in it). So we want the first link to always be in link cache, and the second link to not be in link cache but be an existing page. It should be noted, that this cache, as well as the marker numbering, is shared across all the edit summaries on the page (including one more than is shown, so limit=1 would actually have 2 edit summaries parsed). Special pages always exist so they are treated as if they are always in link cache regardless of what is there. Then we just have to hope that the other page we use is not, but as long as it isn't mentioned anywhere else on the page, we should be good.

The end result is - The special recentchanges link is substituted immediately. It has a marker. When markers are replaced there is one in the attribute that is replaced, this breaks out of the html.

So after first step we get: (pretend \x1B are a literal U+001B character)

```
<a href="/w/index.php/Special:RecentChanges#\x1B000000" title="Special:RecentChanges">link1</a> \x1B0000000
```

Then we do finalize to replace link markers which gives us:

```
<a href="/w/index.php/Special:RecentChanges#<a href="/w/index.php/Test#/autofocus/onfocus=alert(&quot;xss\n&quot;+document.domain)//" title="Test">link2</a>" title="Special:RecentChanges">link1</a> <a href="/w/index.php/Test#/autofocus/onfocus=alert(&quot;xss\n&quot;+document.domain)//" title="Test">link2</a>
```

HTML parses that as if it is:

```
<a href="/w/index.php/Special:RecentChanges#<a href=" w="" index.php="" Test#="" autofocus onfocus="alert(&quot;xss\n&quot;+document.domain)//&quot;" title="Test">link2</a>" title="Special:RecentChanges"&gt;link1</a> <a href="/w/index.php/Test#/autofocus/onfocus=alert(&quot;xss\n&quot;+document.domain)//" title="Test">link2</a>
```

Browser sees autofocus attribute so focuses the link on page load. Then the onfocus event is triggered, so the JS runs.

For cross reference purposes, it seems like this was introduced when support for LinkCache was added in [f7f84dddb33ee4bde12608115a6015ae9463b8d6](/rMWf7f84dddb33ee4bde12608115a6015ae9463b8d6) ([T285917](/T285917)), so MediaWiki 1.38.0 and later are vulnerable.

However, I think changing the marker syntax is much more robust and I trust it much more to be complete. I suppose we could maybe do both,

Tested via MediaWiki-Docker and can confirm both the issue and that this patch seems to fix it. Not sure if there will be caching issues here - I applied, un-applied and re-applied the patch a few different times while testing a few different pages and the old rendered edit summaries (with the xss) seemed to still exist until I cleared my local browser cache, though that may have just been Chrome.

Anyhow, very interesting find! Hopefully we can get this deployed today during the security window and then tracked for the next core release under [T353895](/T353895).

Hm, the patch from [T355538#9479104](/T355538#9479104), which was deployed and *should* be the exact same patch as /srv/patches/1.42.0-wmf.22/core/01-T355538.patch seems to apply just fine to master and wmf/1.42.0-wmf.21 for me. Since we're currently on wmf/1.42.0-wmf.21, is there somewhere we could get access to whatever test version of 1.42.0-wmf.22 [@SecurityPatchBot](/p/SecurityPatchBot/) is looking at? Since wmf/1.42.0-wmf.22 won't be cut for core until next Monday and I don't see any obvious test instances of it on the deployment hosts.

Looked into it and this was a false positive.

The git workspace where we run the checks somehow got an untracked change. That led to a failure for the first patched being applied, which happened to be 01-T355538.patch:

```
