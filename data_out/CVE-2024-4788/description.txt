The Boostify Header Footer Builder for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the create_bhf_post function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create pages or posts with arbitrary content.
