- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The permission `view_other_timesheet` is handled inconsistently between the Kimai UI and the API. In the UI, users see timesheet entries for teams they are part of. However, through the API, all timesheet entries are returned regardless of team membership.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient access control, specifically concerning the granularity of the `view_other_timesheet` permission.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can view timesheet entries they are not supposed to, leading to a confidentiality breach. This is especially critical because timesheets contain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via the API by making a GET request to `/api/timesheets?user=all`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a user account with the `view_other_timesheet` permission and valid API credentials to make the API request. They must also have network access to the vulnerable instance.
