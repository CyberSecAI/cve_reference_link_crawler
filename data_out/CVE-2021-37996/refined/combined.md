Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [19](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call%2Cchrome+label%3ARelease-0-M95) security fixes.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[1261511](https://crbug.com/1261511)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium, which could result
in the execution of arbitrary code, denial of service or information
disclosure.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), security support for Chromium
has been discontinued due to toolchain issues which no longer allow to
build current Chromium releases on buster. You can either upgrade to
the stable release (bullseye) or switch to a browser which continues
to receive security supports in buster (firefox-esr or browsers based
on webkit2gtk)

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 97.0.4692.71-0.1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your chromium packages.

For the detailed security status of chromium please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/chromium>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
