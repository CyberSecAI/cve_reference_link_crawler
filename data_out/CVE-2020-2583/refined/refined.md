Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-2583:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect exception processing during deserialization in `BeanContextSupport`. This means that the Java code did not properly handle errors that occurred while converting data from a serialized format back into a Java object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper deserialization handling, which allows for unexpected behavior during the process.
*   Lack of proper validation or sanitization during deserialization, leading to the incorrect processing of exceptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (DoS) could result from the incorrect exception handling.
*   Other unspecified impacts could also occur, indicating potential for more severe outcomes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is related to deserialization, implying that an attacker could potentially exploit it by providing a maliciously crafted serialized data stream to a vulnerable Java application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to provide a crafted serialized data stream to a vulnerable Java application, which means they may need access to the application through network or other communication means.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in OpenJDK, specifically affecting the `BeanContextSupport` class during deserialization.
* Multiple sources such as Red Hat and Debian identify this CVE, indicating it's a widely acknowledged issue.

*This vulnerability is related to other CVEs such as CVE-2020-2590, CVE-2020-2593, CVE-2020-2601, CVE-2020-2604, CVE-2020-2654, and CVE-2020-2659 which are often fixed in the same updates.*
