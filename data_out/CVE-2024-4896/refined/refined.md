Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4896

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `url` parameter within the WPB Elementor Addons plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the 'url' parameter, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database. These scripts are then executed when a user views the page containing the injected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users who access the affected page.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover:** By injecting malicious scripts, attackers could potentially steal user session cookies, redirect users to phishing pages, or perform other malicious actions that could lead to account compromise.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could potentially modify the appearance of the affected page or website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Input Parameter:** The specific input parameter that is vulnerable is the `url` parameter within the video grid functionality of the plugin. This parameter is used to store the URL of videos.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Access to Plugin Settings:** The attacker must be able to access the plugin settings to input the malicious script within the `url` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the WPB Elementor Addons plugin up to and including version 1.0.9.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by researcher stealthcopter
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `templates/videos_grid.php` file, specifically within the rendering of video URLs.
*   The fix was introduced in version 1.2 of the plugin.
