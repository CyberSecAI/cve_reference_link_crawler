{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application parses the `location.search` query and uses it without proper escaping on the front page React object (`frontend/src/pages/BindAccount/SuccessTips.js`).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code when a victim successfully logs into the page using a specially crafted link. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `ReturnUrl` parameter, e.g., `https://account.suuyuu.cn/login.html?ReturnUrl=javascript:alert(document.location)`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and lure a victim into clicking it and logging into the vulnerable application. The vulnerability exists within the client-side code.",
