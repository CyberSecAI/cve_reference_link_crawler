In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: sdhci: Fix max_seg_size for 64KiB PAGE_SIZE

blk_queue_max_segment_size() ensured:

	if (max_size < PAGE_SIZE)
		max_size = PAGE_SIZE;

whereas:

blk_validate_limits() makes it an error:

	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(lim->max_segment_size < PAGE_SIZE))
		return -EINVAL;

The change from one to the other, exposed sdhci which was setting maximum
segment size too low in some circumstances.

Fix the maximum segment size when it is too low.
