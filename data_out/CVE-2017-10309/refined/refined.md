Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of XML External Entities (XXE) during the processing of Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) files by Oracle Java SE Web Start. This is due to insufficient validation of XML data provided in JNLP files, leading to the possibility of external entity injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or disable the use of external entities within XML documents, which an attacker can exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have the following impacts:
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the XXE vulnerability to read local files on the system where the vulnerable Java application is running. The exploit can be used to extract sensitive information such as configuration files, application source code, or other confidential data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting specific XML payloads, an attacker can cause the Java application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service condition.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  An attacker can potentially use the vulnerability to make requests to internal or external network resources on behalf of the vulnerable Java application, which is especially dangerous when accessing internal, protected resources that are not exposed to the outside world.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can host a malicious JNLP file on a web server. When a user with a vulnerable Java version visits the malicious site, the JNLP file will be downloaded and processed by the Java Web Start application, which is vulnerable to XXE.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit a malicious website or open a malicious JNLP file, so there is user interaction involved in the exploit. However some browsers do not show any warnings when this occurs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to host a malicious JNLP file on a web server reachable by the target.
- **Basic understanding of XML and XXE:**  The attacker needs to understand the basic principles of XXE injection in order to craft the malicious JNLP file.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is present in Java SE versions prior to 8u151.
- The provided exploit code uses a Python web server to host a malicious JNLP file and the corresponding XML external entity definitions.
- The exploit utilizes a `file://` URI to access local files and a `http://` URI to exfiltrate the file contents from a victim machine.

The advisory from Gentoo states that: "A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service condition, modify arbitrary data, or have numerous other impacts." while Red Hat rates this as a critical vulnerability. This indicates that while information disclosure is a major impact, there can be others.
