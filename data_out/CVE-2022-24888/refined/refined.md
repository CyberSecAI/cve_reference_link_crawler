      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of control characters when creating files and folders. The server's control character filtering logic misses leading and trailing whitespace characters such as \\n, \\r, \\t, and \\v in file and folder names.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can create files and folders with leading or trailing control characters. Although the server does reject these characters when they're in the middle of file names, the leading/trailing vulnerability may provide an injection opportunity.",

        "Network-based attacks",
