# Control character filtering misses leading and trailing whitespace in file and folder names

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-w3h6-p64h-q9jp
Apr 27, 2022

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 20.0.14.4, < 21.0.8, < 22.2.4, < 23.0.1

## Patched versions

20.0.14.4, 21.0.8, 22.2.4, 23.0.1

## Description

### Impact

It is possible to create files and folders that have leading and trailing \n, \r, \t, and \v characters. The server rejects files and folders that have these characters in the middle of their names, so this might be an opportunity for injection.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.14.4, 21.0.8, 22.2.4 or 23.0.1.

### Workarounds

No workaround available

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
