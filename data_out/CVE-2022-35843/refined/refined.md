- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the FortiOS SSH login component due to the improper handling of assumed-immutable data. Specifically, a specially crafted RADIUS Access-Challenge response can bypass authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data (CWE-302)
    - Improper access control
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted Access-Challenge response from a RADIUS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted RADIUS Access-Challenge response to the vulnerable device. This implies they must have some network access to the device, as well as a means of sending the malicious RADIUS response.
