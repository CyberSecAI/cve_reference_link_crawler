- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JP2 files within Kofax Power PDF. Specifically, the issue stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can lead to a write operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious JP2 file or visits a malicious page containing a malicious JP2 file, requiring user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious JP2 file to the user, or entice the user to visit a malicious webpage that uses a malicious JP2 file.
