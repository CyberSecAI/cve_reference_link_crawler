## Description

The [Restrict for Elementor](https://restrict.io/restrict-for-elementor?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin-page&utm_campaign=rsc_el "Restricted for Elementor") makes it easy for you to control and protect access to your [Elementor-powered website](https://elementor.com/ "Free WordPress Website Builder").

You can restrict, show and hide widgets, sections and columns to:

* Logged in users and guests
* Users with a specific role (administrator, editor, author, subscriber, etc)
* Users with a specific meta key and value
* Users with a specific [capability](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities "WordPress Roles and Capabilities")
* Author of a post / page
* Visitor’s country or continent – integration with [Geolocation IP Detection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/ "Geolocation IP Detection")

### Premium version integrations and available criteria for content restrictions and other features

* Alternative Content – display Elementor template or HTML / formatted text in place of restricted section, column or a widget
* White Label – by adding just one line to your wp-config.php like this **define(‘RSC\_EL\_PLUGIN\_TITLE’, ‘My Restriction Plugin’);** the whole plugin will become white labeled and ready for your clients.
* [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) users – who made any purchase
* WooCommerce users – who purchased a specific product
* WooCommerce users – who purchased a specific product variation
* Restrict for Elementor also integrates with [WooCommerce Subscription](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) addon which allows you to show / hide content for clients with an active subscription.
* [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) users – who purchased any Easy Digital Downloads product
* Easy Digital Downloads users – who purchased a specific Easy Digital Downloads product
* [Tickera](https://tickera.com/) users – who purchased any ticket
* Tickera users – who purchased a specific ticket type
* Tickera users – who purchased a ticket for a specific event

Works as intended.Even if the droplist only shows “Logged-in Users”The additional “Show/Hide” toggle works both ways. Effectively allowing you to show/hide any elementor widget/section/column. Thanks a bunch broski.

Exactly what I needed. This little plugin is perfect for showing / hiding widgets on Elementor according to whether they are logged in or not.

Purchased the premium version of the plugin. Had a quick query regarding search engine blocking / crawlers as it wasn’t articulated in their documentation. Been waiting ages for a response. Will be looking to process a refund shortly as the plugin is useless if we can’t get support for a critical feature.

I have been chatting with them since I have purchased the product. Support team is not able to understand simple thing and keep replying with random answers. Such poor support I have never seen in my life. Avoid paid version of this plugin.

Hi, there! Idea is the best. It is exactly what is needed. But I found some things could be more precise.
Switcher “Hide/Show” works at that moment invert of whole elementor logic.
Second – your appeal “go PRO” too much intruder, I need every update of page cancel this message, because I not need this option at this time, maybe later, but not right now.
