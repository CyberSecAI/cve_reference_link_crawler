### Description

The Restrict for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 due to improper restrictions on hidden data that make it accessible through the REST API. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract potentially sensitive data from post content.
