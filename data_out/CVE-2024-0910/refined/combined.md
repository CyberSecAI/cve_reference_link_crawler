### Description

The Restrict for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 due to improper restrictions on hidden data that make it accessible through the REST API. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract potentially sensitive data from post content.

## Description

The [Restrict for Elementor](https://restrict.io/restrict-for-elementor?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin-page&utm_campaign=rsc_el "Restricted for Elementor") makes it easy for you to control and protect access to your [Elementor-powered website](https://elementor.com/ "Free WordPress Website Builder").

You can restrict, show and hide widgets, sections and columns to:

* Logged in users and guests

* Visitor’s country or continent – integration with [Geolocation IP Detection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/ "Geolocation IP Detection")

### Premium version integrations and available criteria for content restrictions and other features

* Alternative Content – display Elementor template or HTML / formatted text in place of restricted section, column or a widget
* White Label – by adding just one line to your wp-config.php like this **define(‘RSC\_EL\_PLUGIN\_TITLE’, ‘My Restriction Plugin’);** the whole plugin will become white labeled and ready for your clients.
* [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) users – who made any purchase
* WooCommerce users – who purchased a specific product
* WooCommerce users – who purchased a specific product variation
* Restrict for Elementor also integrates with [WooCommerce Subscription](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) addon which allows you to show / hide content for clients with an active subscription.
* [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) users – who purchased any Easy Digital Downloads product
* Easy Digital Downloads users – who purchased a specific Easy Digital Downloads product

Works as intended.Even if the droplist only shows “Logged-in Users”The additional “Show/Hide” toggle works both ways. Effectively allowing you to show/hide any elementor widget/section/column. Thanks a bunch broski.

Exactly what I needed. This little plugin is perfect for showing / hiding widgets on Elementor according to whether they are logged in or not.

Purchased the premium version of the plugin. Had a quick query regarding search engine blocking / crawlers as it wasn’t articulated in their documentation. Been waiting ages for a response. Will be looking to process a refund shortly as the plugin is useless if we can’t get support for a critical feature.

I have been chatting with them since I have purchased the product. Support team is not able to understand simple thing and keep replying with random answers. Such poor support I have never seen in my life. Avoid paid version of this plugin.

Hi, there! Idea is the best. It is exactly what is needed. But I found some things could be more precise.
Switcher “Hide/Show” works at that moment invert of whole elementor logic.
Second – your appeal “go PRO” too much intruder, I need every update of page cancel this message, because I not need this option at this time, maybe later, but not right now.
