**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to hidden data.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to access data that should be restricted.
*   **REST API Misconfiguration:** The REST API exposes sensitive information due to the lack of proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can extract potentially sensitive information from post content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the REST API.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the affected WordPress site's REST API endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials or login access to the site.

**Summary**
The vulnerability in the "Restrict for Elementor" plugin allows unauthenticated remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from post content due to a flaw in how it handles access restrictions via the REST API.
