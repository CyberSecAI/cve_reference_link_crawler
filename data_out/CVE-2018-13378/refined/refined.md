- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiSIEM admin portal reflects the LDAP server password in the HTML source code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated admin can retrieve the LDAP server password by viewing the HTML source code, potentially leading to further attacks if the admin session is compromised (e.g., via XSS).
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated administrator with access to the FortiSIEM admin portal can view the HTML source code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with access to the FortiSIEM admin portal.
