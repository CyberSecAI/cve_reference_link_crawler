The provided content is related to CVE-2023-41088.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information within the affected DEXGate product.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with network access can capture traffic containing sensitive information.
- This captured information can then be used to gain access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: An attacker needs to have access to the network where clients have access to the DexGate server.
- Passive sniffing: The attacker captures network traffic in cleartext.
- Exploitation occurs after the attacker captures the sensitive information and uses it to gain access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network where traffic to the DexGate server is visible.
- The attacker needs the capability to passively monitor and capture network traffic.
