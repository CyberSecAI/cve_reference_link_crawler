Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-20297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A logic error in how group Access Control Lists (ACLs) are populated when an AnyConnect client establishes a new session. This occurs specifically when the "Forward Reference" and "AnyConnect Firewall Rule" features are enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ACL Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass configured access control lists (ACLs). This is due to a logic error in how group ACLs are populated.
- **Incorrect ACL Application:**  When using object groups for destination networks or ports in conjunction with the "AnyConnect Firewall Rule," the resulting ACL pushed to the client may include overly permissive rules (permit to any destination network or port).
-  **Logic Error:** The core issue lies in how the AnyConnect firewall rule feature, which incorporates object groups, interacts during session establishment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Traffic Bypass:** An attacker could successfully bypass configured ACL rules, allowing unauthorized traffic to flow through the affected device.
- **Compromised Security Posture:** This could allow unauthorized access to internal resources or enable malicious activities that would otherwise be blocked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by establishing an AnyConnect connection to the affected device.
- **Network-Based:**  The attack is performed through network communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** An attacker does not require prior authentication or access to the device. They need the ability to establish an AnyConnect connection.
- **Network Connectivity:** They must be able to connect to the device via AnyConnect.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable configuration:** They must be able to target devices with vulnerable Anyconnect settings (Forward reference and firewall rules with object groups).

**Additional details:**

-   **Affected Products:** Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software with "Forward Reference" and "AnyConnect Firewall Rule" features enabled.
-   **No Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
-   **Fix:** Software updates have been released to address the issue.
-   **CVSS Score:** Base score of 5.8, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
-   **CWE:** CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing).
-   The document provides detailed instructions on determining if a device is vulnerable via CLI commands.
-  The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote unauthenticated user when connecting to a vulnerable ASA or FTD with AnyConnect VPN client.
-  Specifically, if an object group is used to define the destination network, destination port, or both, in the AnyConnect Firewall Rule, then a bypass will be present.
