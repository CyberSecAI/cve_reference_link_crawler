- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the failure of the backend to effectively validate user input, specifically the `familyId` GET parameter in `/Reports/ConfirmReport.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the `familyId` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers can spoof identity.
    - Tamper with existing data.
    - Cause repudiation issues, such as voiding transactions or changing balances.
    - Complete disclosure of all data on the system.
    - Data destruction or making it unavailable.
    - Gain administrative access to the database server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted GET request to `/Reports/ConfirmReport.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `familyId` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker capable of sending HTTP requests.

The provided information includes detailed steps for exploitation using sqlmap, as well as example boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection payloads. It also provides the affected component and the remediation steps, including input validation through prepared statements and server-side filtering of user inputs.
