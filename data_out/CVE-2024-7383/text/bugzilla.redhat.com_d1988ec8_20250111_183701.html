| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2302865#c0)  RaTasha Tillery-Smith    2024-08-05 13:03:52 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in libnbd. A client did not always correctly verify the NBD server's certificate when using TLS to connect to an NBD server. This would allow a man-in-the-middle attack on NBD traffic. After investigation, several separate related problems were found.

Yes, the single CVE applies to all the problems.  They are fixed in the following versions of libnbd:   - 1.21.1 (development)  - 1.20.2 (stable)  - 1.18.5 (stable)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2302865#c4)  Richard W.M.

The latter two are nice to have, but not part of the security fix.  That's why there were not backported.  If you update Debian to >= 1.18.5 or >= 1.20.2 or >= 1.21.1, then you will have fixed everything for the CVE.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2302865#c5)  Richard W.M. Jones    2024-08-06 10:24:28 UTC  ``` Salvatore:  Checking the Debian packages, I see you also have 1.6.1 and 1.14.2 in the oldstable and stable branches respectively.  Do you need backports to those?  <https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libnbd>  As it happens, we may also need to backport the fix to 1.6 branch (because of RHEL 8).  Anyway let me know if you need this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2302865#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-18 13:07:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:6757 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6757](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6757)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2302865#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-24 03:22:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:6964 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6964](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6964)   ``` |  |
