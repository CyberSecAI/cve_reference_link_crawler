{
  "CVE-2024-7383": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in libnbd. The client did not always correctly verify the NBD server's certificate when using TLS to connect to an NBD server. This issue allows a man-in-the-middle attack on NBD traffic.",
    "root_cause": "The libnbd client had multiple flaws in its TLS server certificate verification process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent certificate verification when a certificates directory was not specified, leading to checks being skipped when using the system's CA.",
      "Skipping of all certificate checks when the server's hostname was unknown.",
      "Lack of testing for TLS certificate verification.",
      "Silently skipping verification on very old platforms (e.g., RHEL 7) that lack necessary GnuTLS APIs.",
      "Inability to set the TLS hostname separately from the server name, preventing verification of server certificate when using a proxy or pre-opened socket."
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is possible on NBD traffic, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker positioned between the client and server can intercept and modify NBD traffic due to improper certificate validation in the libnbd client.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be in a position to intercept network traffic between the libnbd client and the NBD server."
