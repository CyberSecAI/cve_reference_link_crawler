**Root Cause:** The WP Popups plugin (versions <= 2.1.5.5) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the website. This suggests a lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input, which is then output on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor could inject scripts such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads.
*   These injected scripts will be executed when users visit the website, potentially leading to:
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Display of unwanted advertisements.
    *   Other HTML based attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The specific method of injecting the malicious script is not specified. However, given that it's an XSS vulnerability, the attack vector would involve injecting malicious code through the plugin's functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts into the plugin through an interface that the plugin handles.
*  The attacker is required to have administrator privileges

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is considered low priority and unlikely to be exploited.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.5.6.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Huynh Tien Si on 2023-10-26
*   The CVSS score is 5.9, which is considered moderate severity, contradicting the "low priority" designation.
*   Patchstack users can enable auto-updates for vulnerable plugins.
