The provided content relates to CVE-2024-8056.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin `mm-breaking-news` does not properly sanitize the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized output of the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Theft of sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `cow` parameter, which is reflected in the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into accessing it through the web browser. The victim needs to have an active session on the affected website.
