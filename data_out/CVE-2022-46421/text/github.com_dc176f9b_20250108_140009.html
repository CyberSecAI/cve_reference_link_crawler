### @potiuk **[potiuk](/potiuk)** commented [Dec 4, 2022](#issue-1475271949)

Those parameters belong to the Hook, not to the connection definition, so we should actually be able to specify them there.

You can also now specify `hive_cli_params` in the HiveOperator and it will pass the parameters to the HiveCliHook created under the hood.
