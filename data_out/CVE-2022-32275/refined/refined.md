Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32275:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a session control failure, not a path traversal issue as initially suspected. The Grafana application fails to properly restrict access to internal system pages, allowing unauthenticated users to access these pages by manipulating the request. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by injecting a specific payload in the request path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient access control:** The application does not correctly validate user sessions, enabling unauthenticated access to restricted resources.
*   **Parameter injection:** The application allows the injection of parameters, such as `{{constructor.constructor'/../../../../../../etc/passwd?orgId=1`, within the request path.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information, such as the `/etc/passwd` file, by manipulating the request path.
*   **Unauthorized access to system pages**: As mentioned in the github issue #50336, unauthenticated users may have access to parts of the UI which they shouldn't, however no data is returned and an "Unauthorized" message is displayed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP request manipulation:** Attackers can modify the HTTP request by injecting a specific payload in the URL.
*   **Direct access:** By knowing the vulnerable directory and crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can directly access the system, bypassing the login page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Grafana instance.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the specific path to exploit, which is `/dashboard/snapshot/`.
*   **Ability to modify HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the URL to include the injection payload. Tools like Burp Suite can be used for this purpose.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Grafana version 8.4.3 (b7d2911ca) and also affects 8.5.5.
*   The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to modify the request using Burp Suite to access the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   The issue has been addressed in Grafana as seen in the provided github issue link.

It's important to note that while this vulnerability allows the attacker to access restricted pages and potentially sensitive information, it does not allow for remote code execution or direct system compromise. The main issue is unauthorized access to information that should be protected.

The NetApp advisory indicates that their products are NOT affected by this vulnerability.
