- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the usage of the `ansible.builtin.file` lookup plugin within Ansible playbooks. This plugin, when used with a low-privileged user account with access to the Job Center feature, can be abused to read arbitrary files within the Celery container.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Arbitrary File Read: The main weakness is the ability to read any file accessible to the Celery container through the `file` lookup plugin.
    - Insufficient Access Control: Low-privileged users have the capability to create and execute custom Ansible playbooks, enabling the exploitation of the file read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Sensitive Information Disclosure: Attackers can gain access to sensitive information, including secrets for hosts, database credentials, and other environmental variables stored in the Celery container.
    - Full System Compromise: Since the Celery container runs as root and has database access, an attacker can steal all secrets, create new admin accounts, and manipulate the database, potentially leading to complete control of the JumpServer instance.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The primary attack vector is through the Job Center feature, which allows users to create and execute Ansible playbooks.
    - A malicious playbook is crafted using the `ansible.builtin.file` lookup plugin to read arbitrary files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs a low-privileged account with access to at least one host and the Job Center feature.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create and run Ansible Playbooks via the web interface.
