Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-30308:

*   **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds Read
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This can happen due to improper bounds checking.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a memory leak. The leaked memory may contain sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning that an attacker would need to have some level of access to the system in order to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need local access and would also require user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. Specifically, the CVSS vector indicates that user interaction (UI:R) is required, and no privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N).
