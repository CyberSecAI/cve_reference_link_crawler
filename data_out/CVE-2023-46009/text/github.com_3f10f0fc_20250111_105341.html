### **[TimChan2001](/TimChan2001)** commented [Oct 10, 2023](#issue-1935016338)

| We found 2 FPE bugs in gifsicle-1.94. Initially, we thought [#193](https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle/issues/193) would be applicable. However, upon discovering that the same reproduction steps didn't work in gifsicle-1.93, we believe this issue might be different. Reproduction Build gifsicle-1.94 with ASAN, then run  ``` src/gifsicle --crop 0,0-256,256 --crop-transparency --flip-vertical -i -p 1,1 --rotate-90 --resize=256x256 -o c $POC  ```  We ran it on a 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04. ASAN Report  1. The POC can be found here. [POC1](https://github.com/TimChan2001/pocs/raw/main/poc-gifsicle-1.94-1)  ``` AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= ==4691==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: FPE on unknown address 0x000000584a02 (pc 0x000000584a02 bp 0x7ffc7d0d8eb0 sp 0x7ffc7d0d8ba0 T0)     #0 0x584a02 in resize_stream /root/gifsicle-1.94/src/xform.c:1327:16     #1 0x593aeb in merge_and_write_frames /root/gifsicle-1.94/src/gifsicle.c:1029:7     #2 0x592f94 in output_frames /root/gifsicle-1.94/src/gifsicle.c:1108:7     #3 0x59b95d in main /root/gifsicle-1.94/src/gifsicle.c:2183:5     #4 0x7f6fa3046c86 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-CVJwZb/glibc-2.27/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:310     #5 0x41bbc9 in _start (/root/gifsicle-1.94/src/gifsicle+0x41bbc9)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
