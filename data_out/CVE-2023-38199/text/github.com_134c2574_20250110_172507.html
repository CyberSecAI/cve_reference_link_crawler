| The security finding is documented in private repository as <https://github.com/coreruleset/security-tracker-private/issues/7>  The decision to fix this was taken in the last CRS chat: [#3159 (comment)](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3159#issuecomment-1494812544)  It would be a good first rule if it was not for a confidential security finding. :) |

| [@fzipi](https://github.com/fzipi) I think this was resolved in [#3237](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3237).  Can we close this issue? I don't think anything is outstanding. |
