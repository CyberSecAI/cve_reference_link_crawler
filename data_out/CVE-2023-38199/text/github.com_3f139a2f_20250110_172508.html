| Got you. Makes sense. It's tricky. Ultimately, we might have to go without a test for the time being. After all, the rule is very clear and easy to understand. It's more like most webserver do not even expose the weakness to ModSec. |

| [@theMiddleBlue](https://github.com/theMiddleBlue) Until Go-FTW / the test parser supports multiple identical headers (whichever one is causing the issue - it looks like maybe Go-FTW just doesn't understand the YAML if you have the same header twice?), if you want to avoid doing `Content-Type: "application/json\nContent-Type: application/foo"`, this test also works as an [encoded request](https://coreruleset.org/docs/development/contribution_guidelines/#encoded-and-raw-requests).  I got it working with this as a 'test' test:  ```   - test_title: 920620-2     desc: Multiple Content-Type request headers     stages:       - stage:           input:             dest_addr: "127.0.0.1"             port: 80             encoded_request: "R0VUIC8gSFRUUC8xLjENCkhvc3Q6IGxvY2FsaG9zdA0KVXNlci1BZ2VudDogVEVTVCBDUlMNCkFjY2VwdDogKi8qDQpDb250ZW50LVR5cGU6IGFwcGxpY2F0aW9uL2pzb24NCkNvbnRlbnQtVHlwZTogYXBwbGljYXRpb24veG1sDQoNCg=="           output:             log_contains: "id \"920620\""  ```  where `R0VUIC8‚Ä¶` is the Base64 encoded equivalent of:  ``` GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: TEST CRS Accept: */* Content-Type: application/json Content-Type: application/xml   ```  (with `0D 0A` line endings)  It doesn't work against Apache, though, as Apache seems to combine the headers into one, which triggers many of our other content type header rules anyway (I think this was already discussed a few weeks ago, anyway):  ``` ...[id "920470"] [msg "Illegal Content-Type header"] [data "application/json, application/xml"]...  ```  But the test works against Nginx üôÇ |

| thx [@RedXanadu](https://github.com/RedXanadu) idk if it worth to have a "if-not-webserver" directive to ignore the test on Apache otherwise we can comment this test and wait for future solutions |

| Sorry [@theMiddleBlue](https://github.com/theMiddleBlue), I should have made that clearer: the example was just a very quick test üòÖ  Here's one which uses the correct CRS testing user agent, accept header, endpoint, etc., so should be ok to use for real:  ``` R0VUIC9nZXQgSFRUUC8xLjENCkhvc3Q6IGxvY2FsaG9zdA0KVXNlci1BZ2VudDogT1dBU1AgQ1JTIHRlc3QgYWdlbnQNCkFjY2VwdDogdGV4dC94bWwsYXBwbGljYXRpb24veG1sLGFwcGxpY2F0aW9uL3hodG1sK3htbCx0ZXh0L2h0bWw7cT0wLjksdGV4dC9wbGFpbjtxPTAuOCxpbWFnZS9wbmcsKi8qO3E9MC41DQpDb250ZW50LVR5cGU6IGFwcGxpY2F0aW9uL2pzb24NCkNvbnRlbnQtVHlwZTogYXBwbGljYXRpb24veG1sDQoNCg==  ```  <=>  ``` GET /get HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: OWASP CRS test agent Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Content-Type: application/json Content-Type: application/xml   ```  You could set `enabled: false` at the top of the test file to skip the test. I agree it would be good to have conditional skipping per-webserver as a feature. |
