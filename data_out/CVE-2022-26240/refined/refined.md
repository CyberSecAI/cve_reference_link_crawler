  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect file permissions set by Remisol Advance during installation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The software sets permissions that allow non-privileged users to overwrite or manipulate executables and libraries used by a service running as SYSTEM.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code as the SYSTEM user, effectively gaining complete control over the local Windows host.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by replacing legitimate executables or libraries with malicious ones.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs low-level access to the workstation. This can be achieved with weak/default credentials or by exploiting other vulnerabilities."
