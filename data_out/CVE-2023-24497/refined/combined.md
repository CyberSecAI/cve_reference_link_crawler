# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1704

## Milesight MilesightVPN requestHandlers.js detail\_device cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-24497,CVE-2023-24496

##### SUMMARY

Cross-site scripting (xss) vulnerabilities exist in the requestHandlers.js detail\_device functionality of Milesight VPN v2.0.2. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary Javascript code injection. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight VPN v2.0.2

##### PRODUCT URLS

MilesightVPN - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/milesightvpn/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

4.7 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

6.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N - chain: TALOS-2023-1702

##### CWE

CWE-80 - Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)

##### DETAILS

The MilesightVPN is a software that make easier the setup of VPN tunnel for the Milesight products and allow to monitor the connection status with a web server interface.

The MilesightVPN exposes the `/Device_Auth` API used to authenticate to the server and to get the an OpenVPN configuration file. This API is for the various Milesight devices, the API requires as data the serial number, the authentication code, the device name and the subnet of the device. Essentially the API expects four entries in the POST payload:

* authcode: is a secret generated by the MilesightVPN
* subnet: the subnet mask of the main network used by the device
* device\_name: the identifier of the device that is connecting to the MilesightVPN server
* sn: is the serial number of the device that is connecting to the MilesightVPN server

After been registered, the device will appear in the Device table showing the provided information. This Device table is in the landing page after the login.

Following the relevant portion of the Embedded JavaScript template related to the device table:

```
<table class="table table-no-bordered" data-striped="true" data-height="100%" id="tbl_content" data-toggle="table" data-url="/detail_device" data-target="/detail_device" data-id-field="sn" data-pagination="true" data-sort-stable="true" data-sort-name="connect_time" data-sort-order="asc" data-toolbar="#deviceToolbar" data-search="true" data-search-on-enter-key="true" data-cache="false">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th data-field="name" data-width="15%" data-sortable="true" data-formatter="name_formatter"><%=lang.detail.device.name%></th>
            <th data-field="status" data-width="10%" data-sortable="true" data-formatter="status_formatter"><%=lang.detail.device.status%></th>
            <th data-field="sn" data-width="10%" data-sortable="true"><%=lang.detail.device.sn%></th>
            <th data-field="virtual_ip" data-width="15%" data-sortable="true"><%=lang.detail.device.virtualip%></th>
            <th data-field="real_ip" data-width="15%" data-sortable="true"><%=lang.detail.device.realip%></th>
            <th data-field="remote_subnet" data-width="15%" data-sortable="true" data-formatter="subnet_formatter"><%=lang.detail.device.subnet%></th>
            <th data-field="connect_time" data-width="15%" data-sortable="true" data-formatter="time_formatter"><%=lang.detail.device.time%></th>
            <th data-field="history" data-width="10%" data-formatter="history_formatter"><%=lang.detail.device.history%></th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

```

The data of this table is filled using the `requestHandlers.js`’s `detail_device` function:

```
function detail_device(res,postdata,connection){
    var $sql="select * from device";
    $sql+=' left join ';
    $sql+=' (select count(*) as total,remote_subnet from device group by remote_subnet) repeatsubnet on repeatsubnet.remote_subnet=device.remote_subnet';
    var result={};
    connection.query($sql).then(function(data){
        if(data['error'])
        {
            res.write(JSON.stringify(result));
            res.end();
        }
        else
        {
            if(data['result'].length>0)
            {
                result=JSON.stringify(data['result']);
                res.writeHead(200,{'Content-Type':'application/json','Content-length':Buffer.byteLength(result, 'utf8')});
                res.write(result);
                res.end();
            }
            else
            {
                res.write(JSON.stringify([]));
                res.end();
            }
        }
    });
}

```

The `device` table has the following schema:

```
+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field         | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name          | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sn            | varchar(12)  | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| virtual_ip    | varchar(15)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| real_ip       | varchar(32)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| remote_subnet | varchar(32)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| connect_time  | int          | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| status        | int          | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

```

The `device` table is populated through the registered devices, so through the `/Device_Auth` API.

From when a Milesight device is registered, using the `/Device_Auth` API, until showing its data in the web interface, no checks about the data are performed, this can lead an XSS vulnerability. An attacker can upload malicious Javascript code through the `/Device_Auth` API, registering a device. An admin of the server would execute this malicious javascript whenever they viewed the details page due to the stored XSS.
An attacker would need to know the Authorization Code of the server to actually use the `/Device_Auth` API. But because TALOS-2023-1702 this information can be easily retrieved by an attacker.

#### CVE-2023-24496 - XSS in the name field

An attacker can upload malicious Javascript code through the `/Device_Auth`’s `device_name` parameter. The `device_name` value will be stored in the `device` database as the `name` field.

#### CVE-2023-24497 - XSS in the remote\_subnet field

An attacker can upload malicious Javascript code through the `/Device_Auth`’s `subnet` parameter. The `subnet` value will be stored in the `device` database as the `remote_subnet` field.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Since the maintainer of this software did not release a patch during the 90 day window specified in our policy, we have now decided to release the information regarding this vulnerability, to make users of the software aware of this problem.
