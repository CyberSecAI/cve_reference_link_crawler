- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of log data. Malicious JavaScript payloads included in the logs are rendered in the Spark UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the web browser of a user viewing the logs in the Spark UI. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or stealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker includes a malicious JavaScript payload in logs, which are then viewed by a user through the Apache Spark UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content into the logs which are then rendered via the UI. This may require access to the logging infrastructure.
