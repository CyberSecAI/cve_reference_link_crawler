The provided content describes an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in Mecha-cms version 3.0.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of the `$x` parameter in the file `lot/x/panel/index/panel/type/page/page.php`. This file can be included from other files, bypassing CMS checks on user identity. The lack of proper sanitization allows for directory traversal and arbitrary file deletion.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Insufficient Input Validation**: The `$x` parameter is not properly filtered, allowing attackers to inject malicious paths.
    - **Path Traversal**: Attackers can use "../" sequences in the crafted paths to access files outside the intended directory.
    - **Bypassed Authentication Checks:** By crafting cookies and URIs, attackers can bypass Mecha CMS's authentication checks.
    - **Unprotected File Deletion:** The `unlink` function in `page.php` deletes files based on the attacker-controlled `$x` parameter from a POST request.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary file deletion on the server.
    - Potential for complete system compromise by deleting critical files, including user authentication files, leading to account takeover and control of the CMS.
    - Data loss and service disruption.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **HTTP Request Manipulation**: Attackers craft a specific HTTP POST request with manipulated parameters, including `data[chunk]`, `page[x]`, and `page[chunk]`.
    - **Cookie Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate cookies to influence the file path generation. The cookie `*3759209392` is specifically crafted with a base64 encoded value such as `Ii4uL3kvbG9nL2Fib3V0Ig==` to manipulate the user path.
    - **URI manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the URI to bypass authentication checks.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Network access**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
    - **Knowledge of Mecha CMS file structure**: The attacker needs to understand how to craft the path to target specific files for deletion.
    - **Ability to craft HTTP requests**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP requests, including headers, cookies, and POST data.
    - **No authentication needed**: The vulnerability can be exploited without valid user credentials after bypassing the authentication check.
