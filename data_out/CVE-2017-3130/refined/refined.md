- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FortiOS IKE packets, which include the Vendor ID, embed the FortiOS build version number.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability. The FortiOS build version number is included in the IKE Vendor ID, potentially revealing information about the system to attackers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially obtain the FortiOS version, which could assist in targeting further attacks exploiting known vulnerabilities present in specific versions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by analyzing IKE packets, which can be observed via network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with the ability to capture or observe network traffic with IKE packets could potentially exploit the vulnerability.
