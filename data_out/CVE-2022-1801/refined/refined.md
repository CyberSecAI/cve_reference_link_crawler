- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin exposes the captcha solution as hidden input fields and as plain text within the page's HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Captcha bypass vulnerability. The captcha solution is directly accessible within the HTML source code of the contact form.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass the captcha protection, allowing automated bots to submit spam messages through the contact form.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an HTTP request to the vulnerable page, extracting the captcha solution from the HTML source, and using that to bypass the captcha when submitting the form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the page with the contact form and be able to send HTTP requests. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
