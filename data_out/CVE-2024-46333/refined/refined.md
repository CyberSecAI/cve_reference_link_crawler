- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new album name.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vectors: The attacker needs to be logged in with an admin account. The attacker can inject the XSS payload through the "virtual_name" parameter when adding a new album.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have admin privileges to create albums, and the XSS is triggered when a user visits the dashboard, including a webmaster account.
