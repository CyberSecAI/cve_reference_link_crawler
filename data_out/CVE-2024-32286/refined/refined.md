The content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromVirtualSer` function within the Tenda W30Ev1.0 V1.0.1.25(633) firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `fromVirtualSer` function uses `sprintf` to format a string using the user-supplied `page` parameter from a POST request. The `sprintf` operation does not perform bounds checking.
- The user-supplied `page` parameter can exceed the capacity of the `s` array, resulting in a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By providing a long string as the `page` parameter, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/VirtualSer` endpoint with a crafted `page` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This would typically be achieved via network access. No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided information.
