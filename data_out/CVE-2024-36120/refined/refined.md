Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36120:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `expressionSimplifier` component of the `javascript-deobfuscator` library. Specifically, it arises from the way the code evaluates expressions during the simplification process, which uses JavaScript's `eval()` function on a string created from the expression to determine its simplified value. This evaluation process, in combination with how the code generates the string, makes it vulnerable to code injection if a crafted string is included as part of the expression.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary weakness is the use of `eval()` to evaluate expressions constructed as strings, without adequate sanitization, this leads to code injection vulnerability.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate or sanitize the input strings used in expression simplification, allowing attacker controlled strings to be evaluated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context where the deobfuscator library is being used. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including data theft, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Payloads:** The vulnerability is exploited by providing a crafted payload to the `expressionSimplifier` component. This payload is designed to inject malicious code through the expression simplification process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to control the input:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the input that is fed into the `expressionSimplifier`, specifically crafting an expression with malicious code embedded in a string.
- **Local Access:**  The CVSS indicates a local attack vector, suggesting that the attacker needs to be able to provide this crafted input to the application using the vulnerable library. This might be through manipulating the code or files being deobfuscated.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided example of a crafted payload is `!'hello\\"+alert(\`Hello World\`)//"'`, this payload demonstrates how string concatenation and the use of `eval()` allows the attacker to execute `alert('Hello World')`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `js-deobfuscator` prior to 1.1.0.
- The fix involves sanitizing input before passing it to `eval` or using a more secure method of expression evaluation.
- The code changes in the commit replace the vulnerable expression simplification approach.

In summary, CVE-2024-36120 is a code injection vulnerability in the `js-deobfuscator` library, specifically within its expression simplification feature, caused by insecure use of `eval()`. Attackers can exploit this by crafting specific expressions containing malicious code in strings which leads to arbitrary code execution within the environment using the library.
