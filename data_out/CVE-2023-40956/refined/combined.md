## CVE ID

**CVE-2023-40956**

## Description

**SQL injection vulnerability** in Cloudroits Website Job Search v.15.0 allows a remote attacker to **execute arbitrary code** via the `name` parameter in `controllers/main.py` component.

## Affected product

**Website Job Search**

## Technical name of affected product

`odoo_website_job_search`

## Link to the Odoo Apps Store

<https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/odoo_website_job_search/>

## Vulnerability type

SQL injection

## Impact

Privilege Escalation, Information Disclosure

## Affected components:

`controllers/main.py:RecruitmentInherit::search_contents(**kw)`

## Attack vectors

A remote attacker of an Odoo instance with the `odoo_website_job_search` module installed can call the `search_contents` controller endpoint by sending an HTTP POST request to the `/job/search/` route with a crafted `name` parameter. The `name` parameter contains an SQL query that is injected to the existing SQL query and executed through the database cursor.

## Proof-of-Concept

Note

A recorded demo of the PoC as well as the code for the exploit are available under this directory.

The remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request with the following body:

`"name": "dev'; UPDATE res_users SET password='whatever' WHERE login='admin'; select id as res_id, name as name, name as value from hr_job where name ILIKE 'dev"`

Since the affected controller route does not require authentication, anyone can reach the job/search endpoint, triggering the attack. Since the database cursor is directly employed, no access rights checking is performed. Also, no user input validation or sanitation is performed, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, with consequences ranging from information disclosure to data tampering and privilege escalation. A possible patch could make use of prepared statements
