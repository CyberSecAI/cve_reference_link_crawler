# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1846

## stb stb\_vorbis.c comment heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability

##### May 1, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-47212

##### SUMMARY

A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the comment functionality of stb \_vorbis.c v1.22. A specially crafted .ogg file can lead to an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

stb \_vorbis.c v1.22

##### PRODUCT URLS

stb\_vorbis.c - <https://github.com/nothings/stb>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-190 - Integer Overflow or Wraparound

##### DETAILS

`stb_vorbis.c` is a single-header file library for decoding Ogg Vorbis non-proprietary audio files.

The `stb_vorbis.c` allows parsing of Ogg Vorbis files. Comments can be store in this file format. Following the relevant code that parses the comments in the `stb_vorbis.c` file:

```
    static int start_decoder(vorb *f)
    {
       [...]
   [1] f->comment_list_length = get32_packet(f);
       f->comment_list = NULL;
       if (f->comment_list_length > 0)
       {
   [2]    f->comment_list = (char**) setup_malloc(f, sizeof(char*) * (f->comment_list_length));
          if (f->comment_list == NULL)                  return error(f, VORBIS_outofmem);
       }

       for(i=0; i < f->comment_list_length; ++i) {
          len = get32_packet(f);
   [3]    f->comment_list[i] = (char*)setup_malloc(f, sizeof(char) * (len+1));
          if (f->comment_list[i] == NULL)               return error(f, VORBIS_outofmem);

          for(j=0; j < len; ++j) {
             f->comment_list[i][j] = get8_packet(f);
          }
          f->comment_list[i][len] = (char)'\0';
       }
       [...]
    }

```

The comment list starts with 4 bytes for the `comment_list_length` field, which specifies the number of comment entries that follow this field. Each entry is composed of two fields: the size of the comment and the comment itself. The encoding looks like this:

```
<32bit comment_list_length> (<32bit comment_length> <comment[comment_length]>)[comment_list_length]

```

At `[1]` the `comment_list_length` is parsed and later used at `[2]` for allocating an array of `char*`. The array is filled up iterating the code at `[3]` that allocates the size of the current comment.

At `[2]` the size used for allocating the array is calculated through `sizeof(char*) * (f->comment_list_length)`. This calculation could cause an integer overflow, which would lead to allocation of less space than required for the comment pointers. Because the integer overflow occurs only during the calculation of the space required, this will not impact the `f->comment_list_length` value itself, leading to allocation of more comment pointers than there is space. This leads to an out-of-bounds write at `[3]`. With enough heap grooming an attacker would be able to use this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.
