Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The mini-app 'animal-art-lab' exposes the channel access token in its client-side code. This token, which is meant to be a secret, is included in the response of a specific request, making it accessible to anyone who can access the mini-app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the channel access token to an unauthorized actor (the client-side). This token is a critical credential used to secure communication within the Line platform.
*   **Client-Side Storage of Credentials:** The application stores a sensitive credential in a place where it can easily be retrieved.
*   **Lack of proper authorization checks:** The channel access token is included in the response for  `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`, indicating that there are no checks to prevent the token from being leaked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** Attackers can use the exposed channel access token to broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'animal-art-lab' mini-app.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Access to the token could be leveraged to perform more sophisticated attacks.
*   **User harm**: Users are at risk of receiving harmful content, fraud information, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Request Interception:** An attacker can retrieve the channel access token by inspecting the response from the request to `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card` when using the 'animal-art-lab' mini-app.
*   **Client-Side Script Access:** Once the mini-app is opened, any malicious script could access this token and use it in any way it sees fit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Line App Access:** The attacker needs to be able to open the 'animal-art-lab' mini-app through the Line app.
*   **Network Monitoring Capabilities (optional):** While not strictly required, observing network requests/responses aids an attacker in pinpointing the vulnerability.
*   **Basic understanding of web requests and inspecting them:** To access the token, the attacker must understand the basics of web requests and responses and know how to inspect them

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes screenshots that highlight the location of the exposed token and the official definition of the channel access token.
*   The vulnerability affects all users of the 'animal-art-lab' mini-app.
*   The affected version of the app is v13.6.1.
