The provided content relates to CVE-2024-3357.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page through the `end` parameter in the `/admin/mod_reports/index.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take control of a user's browser or steal user information by executing malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a crafted `end` parameter, containing JavaScript code. When a victim clicks on this manipulated URL, the malicious code executes in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL containing the payload. The attacker would then need to trick a user into clicking the link, typically through phishing or other social engineering methods. No special privileges on the target system or network are needed.
