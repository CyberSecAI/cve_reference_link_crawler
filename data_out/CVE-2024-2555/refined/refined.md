Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

The document details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities found in a Task Management System. Specifically, the following files are vulnerable:

1.  **`edit-task.php`**:
    *   **Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates the `task_id` parameter from the URL into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection via the `task_id` GET parameter
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive data, modify the database, or potentially gain unauthorized access. The provided example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `edit-task.php` with a malicious `task_id` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

2.  **`task-details.php`**:
    *   **Root Cause:** Similar to `edit-task.php`, the application uses the unsanitized `task_id` parameter in a SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection via the `task_id` GET parameter.
    *   **Impact:**  Same as `edit-task.php` - data exfiltration, modification, or unauthorized access. The provided example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `task-details.php` with a malicious `task_id` parameter.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

3.  **`update-employee.php`**:
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses the `admin_id` parameter directly in an SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection via the `admin_id` GET parameter
    *   **Impact:**  Same as other SQLi vulnerabilities, allowing data breaches, alterations, and unauthorized system access. The provided example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `update-employee.php` with a malicious `admin_id` parameter.
   *  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

4.  **`update-admin.php`**:
    *   **Root Cause:** The application directly uses the `admin_id` parameter from the URL in a SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection via the `admin_id` GET parameter
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, modification of admin data, or potentially complete system takeover. The provided example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `update-admin.php` with a malicious `admin_id` parameter.
     *  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Common Weakness:**

*   All four vulnerabilities stem from the same root cause:  **Lack of input sanitization and proper parameterization of SQL queries.** The application uses GET parameters directly in SQL queries, making them susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes proof of concept (POC) requests demonstrating time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP()` in the SQL queries.
*   The content also includes screenshots of `sqlmap` results, which further confirms the SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The application seems to use a PHP backend and is likely using direct database queries instead of prepared statements or parameterized queries.
*   The source code snippets provided for each file confirm that GET parameters are being directly used in the SQL queries without sanitization.

This analysis provides a detailed breakdown of multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, including the root cause, impact, attack vector, and technical details.
