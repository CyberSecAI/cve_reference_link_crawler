- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory due to lack of permissions control and lack of control in the path name construction.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Stealing secrets to unlock admin controllers based on ajax script.
    - Exfiltrating all modules with all versions.
    - Stealing table\_prefix to facilitate SQL injections or steal database access.
    - Bypassing WAF / htaccess restrictions to read forbidden files.
    - Downloading personal information without restriction.
- **Attack vectors**: Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction required, guest access is sufficient. The attacker sends a crafted URL parameter to the vulnerable script.
