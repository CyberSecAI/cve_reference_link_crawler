-----END PGP MESSAGE-----

### Randomly generated private key

Private keys provide an extra layer of security, allowing only key holders with the passphrase to access and decrypt data, while also ensuring a cryptographically-backed audit trail.
### End-to-end encryption

Enhances security by ensuring that the private key, generated and stored on the user's device, never passes through the server, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
### Multifactor by default

Provides a default two-factor authentication by design, requiring both a private key and a passphrase. Plus, it also supports additional MFA layers for even more robust authentication.
### Brute force protection

Protects against brute force attacks by encrypting each password with a user‚Äôs auto-generated, unguessable private key - unlike legacy password managers that rely solely on the user's master password.
### Phishing resistant

On top of a private key and passphrase, Passbolt uses a 3-letter token and color combination, as well as URL matching, to protect against phishing.
### 1:1 encryption

Passbolt encrypts each password individually for granular, containerised data privacy, ensuring that the compromise of one password does not affect others.
### Interoperable

Passbolt is built on top of a JSON API and uses interoperable cryptography (OpenPGP). All operations can be run from any server using our CLI or SDKs.
### Admin controlled recovery mechanisms

Passbolt offers an account recovery feature, allowing users to regain access with admin approval, and provides organisation-wide policies for account recovery preferences.
## Secure, private, compliant collaboration

Passbolt helps you check the boxes even with the most stringent compliance and regulatory frameworks.
