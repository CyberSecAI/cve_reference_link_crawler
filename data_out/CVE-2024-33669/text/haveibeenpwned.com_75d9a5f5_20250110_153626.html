### Breaches you were pwned in

A "breach" is an incident where data has been unintentionally exposed to the
public. Using the [1Password password manager](https://1password.com/haveibeenpwned/)
helps you ensure all your passwords are strong and unique such that a breach of one service
doesn't put your other services at risk.

### Pastes you were found in

A [paste](/Pastes) is information that has been published to a
publicly facing website designed to share content and is often an early indicator of a data
breach. Pastes are automatically imported and often removed shortly after having been
posted. Using the [1Password password manager](https://1password.com/haveibeenpwned)
helps you ensure all your passwords are strong and unique such that a breach of one service
doesn't put your other services at risk.
