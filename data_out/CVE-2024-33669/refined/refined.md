Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-33669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Passbolt's implementation of the Pwned Passwords service. Passbolt was sending queries to the HaveIBeenPwned API as users typed in their passwords, rather than after the password was fully entered. This incremental querying, combined with the API's k-anonymity feature, allowed an attacker to progressively deduce the password by observing the series of partial SHA1 hash prefixes sent to the API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Leakage:**  Sending partial password hashes incrementally to the Pwned Passwords API leaks information about the password as it's being typed.
*   **Misuse of k-Anonymity:** The k-anonymity property of the Pwned Passwords API was not designed for incremental queries, allowing attackers to narrow down password candidates as more of the password was typed.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting/Debouncing (Initially):** The Passbolt browser plugin initially did not implement adequate delays when making API requests. This allowed multiple queries to be sent in quick succession while a user was typing their password.  Though a 300ms debounce was implemented, it still allowed for multiple queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Password Recovery:** An attacker could recover a user's password by observing the sequence of partial SHA1 hashes sent to the Pwned Passwords API. This is especially true for passwords of 11 characters or more.
*   **Credential Compromise:** Recovered passwords could be used to access the user's Passbolt account and other accounts where the same password was used.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the Passbolt browser extension and the Pwned Passwords API. This could be achieved through:
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting traffic on a network the user is connected to.
    *   **Compromised TLS Proxies:** In scenarios where TLS proxies are used in corporate environments, and the attacker has control of the proxy.
    *   **Malicious Browser Extensions/Software:**  An attacker could potentially control a compromised browser extension or other software on the user's machine and observe the API calls.
    *   **Compromised DNS Servers:** Attackers controlling DNS servers could redirect requests.
    * **Compromised Pwned Password Mirror:**  Attackers who have deployed their own local mirror of the Pwned Passwords database and can intercept queries from Passbolt users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Visibility:** The attacker needs the ability to observe network traffic between the Passbolt client and the Pwned Passwords API.
*   **Technical Proficiency:**  The attacker needs to be able to extract the partial SHA1 hashes from the intercepted traffic and then use this information to brute-force the password using tools like Hashcat (as demonstrated in the blog).

**Additional Details from the Content:**
*   **Hashcat Module:** The blog post details the development of a custom Hashcat module to demonstrate the password recovery attack. This module takes the intercepted partial hashes as input and recovers the password using a brute-force technique enhanced by filtering based on the hashes.
*   **Performance:** The blog post evaluates the performance of the attack on different GPUs. Recovery time was on the order of seconds to minutes for weaker passwords and a few hours using rented high-end GPUs for complex passwords.
*   **Passbolt Fix:** Passbolt addressed the issue by:
    *   Querying the Pwned Passwords API only when saving a new or updated password.
    *   Querying the API only if the password's estimated entropy is larger than 60 bits (approximately 10 mixed-case characters).

**Mitigation:**
*  Passbolt now only queries the Pwned Passwords API when saving a password and if the password meets a certain level of complexity.
*   The Pwned Passwords API documentation was updated to warn about the risks of incremental searches.
*   Passbolt implemented fixes in their browser extensions (v4.6.2 and later).
