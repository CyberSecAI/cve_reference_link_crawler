- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error in the social login implementation for guest users on Cisco Business Wireless Access Points.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication leading to a bypass of the social login mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the social login authentication and gain access to the Guest Portal without proper credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: An adjacent attacker can attempt to authenticate to an affected device by exploiting the logic error.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in an adjacent network position to the vulnerable device and does not need any credentials.
