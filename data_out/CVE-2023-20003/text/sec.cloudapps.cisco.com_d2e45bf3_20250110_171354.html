This vulnerability is due to a logic error with the social login implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the Guest Portal without authentication.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
