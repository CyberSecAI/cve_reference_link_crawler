- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization in FortiClient Windows related to the handling of session IDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-285) leading to web filter bypass. Modifying the session-id parameter allows an unauthenticated attacker to circumvent the web filter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass web filter restrictions.
- **Attack vectors:** Modifying the session-id parameter within the FortiClient Windows application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker needs to be able to modify the session ID parameter within the FortiClient application. This implies the attacker has some degree of access to or control over the FortiClient instance.
