Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-4047:

**Root Cause:**
A flaw in the way Firefox calculates the delay for popup notifications, specifically related to the `timeShown` variable when a notification panel is hidden and reshown, allows for bypassing clickjacking protections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Clickjacking vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the logic of the security delay mechanism implemented for permission prompts. The `timeShown` variable was not properly overridden when a popup was hidden and then reshown.
- **Incorrect delay calculation:** The delay timer is not correctly reset or updated when the popup notification is hidden and then redisplayed, leading to a situation where the delay is bypassed and an attacker can immediately trigger the permission prompt buttons.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Permissions bypass:** Attackers can trick users into granting permissions (like geolocation, camera, microphone) that they would not normally grant, bypassing the intended security measure designed to prevent accidental clicks. This can be achieved by obscuring the prompt with a window.open() call, and subsequently closing it.
- **Potential for privilege escalation:**  By gaining access to sensitive permissions, attackers can potentially escalate their privileges on the user's system or gain access to private data.
- **Spoofing:** The user can be tricked into believing that they are interacting with a legitimate request, while they are actually interacting with a manipulated interface controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Clickjacking:** The primary attack vector is clickjacking. The attacker overlays a transparent or opaque malicious layer over the intended permission prompt using a new window created via `window.open()`, and rapidly closes the window after a delay.
- **New window manipulation:** The attacker uses a new window, opened via JavaScript `window.open()`, to hide the permission prompt and then close it in order to reset the timer used for the security delay.
- **Timing manipulation:**  The vulnerability exploits the fact that the delay timer on the notification panel is not reset when the window is hidden and reshown.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page. This could be achieved via a compromised website or through a cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS).
- The attacker needs to be able to create a new window via `window.open()` and close it after a delay.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the user's system.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is a regression from a previous fix for a similar issue (CVE-2023-32207), highlighting that the previous fix was incomplete.
- The vulnerability affects desktop versions of Firefox. Android is not affected.
- The fix involves ensuring that the `timeShown` variable is correctly updated when a popup is hidden and reshown.
- The fix has been implemented in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 115.1, and Firefox ESR 102.14.
