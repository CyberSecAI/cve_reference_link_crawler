# ipl\Web\Common\CsrfCounterMeasure is susceptible to CSRF

Low

[nilmerg](/nilmerg)
published
GHSA-w9pg-7c3h-fc8j
Aug 5, 2024

## Package

ipl-web
(Icinga)

## Affected versions

<0.10.1

## Patched versions

0.10.1

## Description

### Impact

Some of the recent development by Icinga is, under certain circumstances, susceptible to cross site request forgery. (CSRF)

Affected products:

* Icinga Web (>=2.12.0)
* Icinga DB Web (>=1.0.0)
* Icinga Notifications Web (>=0.1.0)
* Icinga Web JIRA Integration (>=1.3.0)

All affected products, in any version, will be unaffected by this once `icinga-php-library` is upgraded.

### Patches

Version 0.10.1 will include a fix for this. It will be published as part of the `icinga-php-library` v0.14.1 release.

### Severity

Low

3.9

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
