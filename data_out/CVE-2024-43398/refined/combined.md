### Improvements

* Removed duplicated entity expansions for performance.

  + [GH-194](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/pull/194)
  + Patch by Viktor Ivarsson.
* Improved namespace conflicted attribute check performance. It was

  too slow for deep elements.

  + Reported by l33thaxor.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that default entity expansions are counted for

  security check. Default entity expansions should not be counted

  because they don't have a security risk.

  + [GH-198](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/issues/198)
  + [GH-199](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/pull/199)
  + Patch Viktor Ivarsson
* Fixed a parser bug that parameter entity references in internal

  subsets are expanded. It's not allowed in the XML specification.

  + [GH-191](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/pull/191)
  + Patch by NAITOH Jun.
* Fixed a stream parser bug that user-defined entity references in

  text aren't expanded.

  + [GH-200](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/pull/200)
  + Patch by NAITOH Jun.

published
GHSA-vmwr-mc7x-5vc3
Aug 22, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 3.3.6

## Patched versions

3.3.6

## Description

### Impact

The REXML gem before 3.3.6 has a DoS vulnerability when it parses an XML that has many deep elements that have same local name attributes.

If you need to parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API like `REXML::Document.new`, you may be impacted to this vulnerability. If you use other parser APIs such as stream parser API and SAX2 parser API, this vulnerability is not affected.

### Patches

The REXML gem 3.3.6 or later include the patch to fix the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Don't parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API.
