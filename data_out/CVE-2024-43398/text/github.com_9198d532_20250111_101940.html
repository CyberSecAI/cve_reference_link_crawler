### Improvements

* Removed duplicated entity expansions for performance.

  + [GH-194](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/pull/194)
  + Patch by Viktor Ivarsson.
* Improved namespace conflicted attribute check performance. It was

  too slow for deep elements.

  + Reported by l33thaxor.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that default entity expansions are counted for

  security check. Default entity expansions should not be counted

  because they don't have a security risk.

  + [GH-198](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/issues/198)
  + [GH-199](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/pull/199)
  + Patch Viktor Ivarsson
* Fixed a parser bug that parameter entity references in internal

  subsets are expanded. It's not allowed in the XML specification.

  + [GH-191](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/pull/191)
  + Patch by NAITOH Jun.
* Fixed a stream parser bug that user-defined entity references in

  text aren't expanded.

  + [GH-200](https://github.com/ruby/rexml/pull/200)
  + Patch by NAITOH Jun.
