# Apple web content filter bypass allows unrestricted access to blocked content (macOS/iOS/iPadOS/visionOS/watchOS)

*From*: Nosebeard Labs <labs () nosebeard co>

```

Dear colleagues,

```
Nosebeard Labs is pleased to share its latest advisory, detailing a
bypass of Apple's system wide web content filter. The HTML version of
this advisory is also available at:
```

<https://nosebeard.co/advisories/nbl-001.html>

Warmest regards,
Nosebeard Labs

## Summary
Nosebeard Labs Security Advisory NBL-001

```
Title: Apple web content filter bypass allows unrestricted access to
blocked content (macOS/iOS/iPadOS/visionOS/watchOS)
```

Advisory ID: NBL-001
Date: 2024-11-15
Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.1)
Affected Product: Safari on any Apple device with Screen Time enabled
CVE ID: CVE-2024-44206

## Overview

```
Nosebeard Labs has identified a critical vulnerability in Apple’s system
wide web content filter that allows a full bypass of content
restrictions. This vulnerability, which occurs specifically when Screen
Time’s content filtering settings are enabled, permits users or
attackers to access restricted websites in Safari without detection. By
exploiting a misalignment between Screen Time’s Access Control List
(ACL) and WebKit’s URI validation, a specially crafted URI can
circumvent both layers of protection.
Apple has assigned CVE-2024-44206 to this issue and issued a fix for
macOS Sonoma 14.x, iOS/iPadOS 17.x, watchOS 10.x, visionOS 1.x, Safari
17.x and up.
```

However, a fix is still pending for the backport channels.

## Description

```
This vulnerability arises when the WebKit Cocoa layer in Safari ingests
a URI without performing comprehensive validation, combined with a
failure by the Screen Time ACL filter to recognize and block the
malformed URI. The flaw allows a crafted URI to bypass all Screen Time
content filtering settings, including deny/allow lists and parental
content filters, providing unrestricted access to blocked content.
```

## Affected Systems

```
This vulnerability affects all devices on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS
and visionOS platforms with Safari and Screen Time enabled, impacting an
estimated 250 million devices globally.
```

## Attack Scenarios
The vulnerability can be exploited both locally and remotely:

```
1. Local Exploitation: Users can manipulate the address bar to manually
enter a crafted URI, bypassing Screen Time restrictions.
2. Network-Based Exploitation: Attackers can load restricted content
remotely by embedding a crafted URI within an iframe, bypassing
restrictions without requiring user interaction.
```

## Impact

```
1. Confidentiality: Unrestricted access to restricted websites
compromises the confidentiality of content filtering controls,
potentially exposing sensitive or inappropriate material.
2. Scope and Integrity: This vulnerability spans across two separate
security mechanisms (Screen Time and WebKit), representing a critical
architecture-level issue. Additionally, accessing unsecured or unlogged
resources poses potential integrity risks.
```

## CVSS Score
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N
Score: 9.1 (Critical)

## Mitigations

```
Upgrade to the latest iOS/iPadOS 17.x or 18.x / macOS Sonoma 14.x /
visionOS 1.x / watchOS 10.x / Safari 17.6 respectively. Users who are
unable to apply a fix can contact us for more info.
```

## Vendor Response

```
Apple has issued CVE-2024-44206 and supplied a fix within WebKit;
however, a fix remains pending for iOS/iPadOS version 16.x. We recommend
that Apple undertake further review to address the issue comprehensively.
