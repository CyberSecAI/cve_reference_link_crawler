Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the unexpected automatic deserialization of Java objects within the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver. This occurs when the driver processes data received from a MySQL server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe Deserialization: The core weakness is the driver's susceptibility to processing malicious serialized Java objects. Java deserialization, if not handled carefully, can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The driver does not adequately validate the incoming data stream, allowing an attacker to inject a harmful payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the machine running the vulnerable MySQL Connector/J client. This could lead to:
- Complete system compromise
- Data exfiltration or modification
- Denial of service
- Installation of malware

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the MySQL protocol. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered when a vulnerable client establishes a connection to a malicious MySQL server, which sends back a crafted, malicious payload during data transfer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A malicious MySQL server is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to make the vulnerable client connect to the malicious server. This could be achieved through DNS poisoning, a man-in-the-middle attack, or by tricking the user into connecting to the malicious server directly.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create a malicious serialized Java object payload targeting vulnerable versions of mysql-connector-java.

**Additional Notes:**
The Debian security advisory notes that the issue was discovered by Thijs Alkemade. Oracle's advisory mentions that the fix for CVE-2017-3523 is included in their April 2017 Critical Patch Update. The provided oracle advisory also indicates that affected versions are 5.1.41 and earlier
