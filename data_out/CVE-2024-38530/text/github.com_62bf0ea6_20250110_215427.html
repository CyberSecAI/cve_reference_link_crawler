# Arbitrary File Upload in "modules/h5p/save.php"

Critical

[adia](/adia)

GHSA-88c3-hp7p-grgg
Aug 12, 2024

## Package

Open eClass

## Affected versions

<= 3.15

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the "save" functionality of the H5P module enables unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This may lead in unrestricted RCE on the backend server, since the upload location is accessible from the internet.

### Details

The root cause of this issue, is that there is no validation/sanitization of the user-controllable file input, including the filename and its contents.

As seen in the snippet below, L38 sets the "$target\_file" variable, which is the filename on the server's filesystem to store the user's uploaded file,

to the user-controlled filename under the publicly-accessible directory specified in L36.

```
// File: modules/h5p/save.php
        $require_current_course = true;
        require_once '../../include/baseTheme.php';
        require_once 'classes/H5PFactory.php';

26:     uploadContent();
        header("location: index.php");

        function uploadContent(): bool {
            global $course_id, $course_code, $webDir;

36:         $upload_dir = $webDir . '/courses/temp/h5p/' . $course_code;
            if (file_exists($upload_dir)) {
                H5PCore::deleteFileTree($upload_dir);
            }
            mkdir($upload_dir, 0755, true);

38:         $target_file = $upload_dir . "/" . my_basename($_FILES["userFile"]["name"]);
39:         move_uploaded_file($_FILES["userFile"]["tmp_name"], $target_file);

            $factory = new H5PFactory();
            $framework = $factory->getFramework();

            $h5pPath = $webDir . '/courses/h5p';
```
### Impact

Unauthenticated users are able to upload arbitrary files in the server's filesystem, under a publicly accessible location through the internet. By uploading a PHP file, users are able to execute OS commands on the backend server (RCE).

It should be noted that exploitation of this issue requires the H5P functionality to be enabled in a course accessible by the adversary's user role.
