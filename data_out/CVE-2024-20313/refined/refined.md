- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of OSPF updates processed by a device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to the lack of validation in OSPF update processing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malformed OSPF update to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must be able to reach the OSPF adjacency of the target device to send the malformed update.
