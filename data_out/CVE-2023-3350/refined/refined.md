The content is related to CVE-2023-3350.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cryptographic issue in the Iberm√°tica RPS 2019 software. Specifically, the application logs SQL queries, including password hashes, using AES-CBC-128 bit encryption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-310: Cryptographic Issues:** The application uses a weak encryption method (AES-CBC-128 bit) to store password hashes in logs, which can be easily decrypted.
- The log file containing the sensitive information is accessible to unauthenticated users, after enabling the logging mechanism by accessing the `/RPS2019Service/status.html` URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can download the log file, decrypt the password hashes, and obtain user passwords in plain text. This could lead to unauthorized access and control over user accounts and the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** An attacker can access the vulnerable web endpoint (`/RPS2019Service/status.html`) over the network.
- **Log File Access:** The attacker needs to download the log file generated by the application.
- **Decryption:** The attacker needs to decrypt password hashes using a .NET function, revealing plaintext passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Unauthenticated network access to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Ability to download the log file.
- Ability to use a .NET function to decrypt the password hashes from the log file.
