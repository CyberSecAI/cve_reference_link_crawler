- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from a misconfiguration in Cloud Foundry deployments using HAProxy where the `ha_proxy.forwarded_client_cert` property is set to `forward_only_if_route_service` combined with route services enabled. This allows crafted HTTP requests to bypass mTLS authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - mTLS bypass due to improper handling of client certificates when using route services.
    - The `forward_only_if_route_service` setting does not correctly enforce mTLS when route services are involved.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass mTLS authentication to Cloud Foundry applications, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests targeting Cloud Foundry applications via HAProxy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the Cloud Foundry environment and exploit the specific misconfiguration in HAProxy. This usually means being able to make network requests to the router.
