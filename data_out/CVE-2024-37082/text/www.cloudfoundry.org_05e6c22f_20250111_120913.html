## Severity

CRITICAL

## Vendor

CloudFoundry Foundation

## Versions Affected

Routing Release < 0.299.0 (in combination with HAProxy Release > 10.6.0)

## Description

When deploying Cloud Foundry together with the haproxy-boshrelease and using a non default configuration, it might be possible to craft HTTP requests that bypass mTLS authentication to Cloud Foundry applications.

You are affected if you have route-services enabled in routing-release and have configured the haproxy-boshrelease property “ha\_proxy.forwarded\_client\_cert” to “forward\_only\_if\_route\_service”.

## Mitigation

In case your setup – CF with HAProxy release, route-service enabled and mTLS authentication used – is affected by this vulnerability, it is strongly recommended to apply the following mitigation:

Upgrade routing\_release version to 0.299.0 or greater

Set “router.route\_services\_strict\_signature\_validation” to “true”

The cf-deployment release v40.17.0 can be used to upgrade the routing release.

This issue was responsibly reported by Christian Schubert.
