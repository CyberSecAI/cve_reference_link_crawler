Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-24998:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from wpscan.com explicitly mentions CVE-2021-24998 and describes an "Insecure Password Creation" vulnerability in the "Simple JWT Login" plugin. The vulnerability is directly linked to this CVE ID, therefore the content is relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The plugin uses the PHP function `str_shuffle` to generate random passwords.
   - `str_shuffle` is not cryptographically secure, as stated in the PHP documentation.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   -  **Insufficient Cryptography**: The plugin uses a non-cryptographically secure function (`str_shuffle`) for password generation, making the generated passwords weak and predictable.
  
**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   -  **Insecure Password Creation**: Attackers can potentially predict and compromise user passwords created using the vulnerable function, leading to account takeover and unauthorized access.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is present in the password generation function used when creating new user accounts via the plugin. 
    -  An attacker does not require specific privileges or access to exploit the weakness
  
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - An attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the user creation function and then gain access to the created password.

**Additional Notes**
   - This content provides much more specific details than a generic CVE description including the specific vulnerable function used, and references to the commit where the fix was applied
