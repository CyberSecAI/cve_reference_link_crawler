*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the file upload feature of OTRS and ((OTRS)) Community Edition.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22). This allows users to upload files outside the intended application directory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload malicious files to directories accessible by the web server. This can potentially lead to the execution of local code, such as Perl scripts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the file upload feature, which can be triggered by authenticated agents or customer users.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated agent or customer user. They also need to be able to manipulate the filename during upload. The UI interaction requirement is user interaction
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   OTRS: Versions 7.0.x through 7.0.49, 8.0.x, 2023.x, and 2024.x through 2024.3.2
    *   ((OTRS)) Community Edition: Versions 6.0.1 through 6.0.34
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in OTRS 7.0.50 and OTRS 2024.4.3.
