# Path traversal in javadoc file expansion (arbitrary file creation/overwrite) (`GHSL-2024-073`)

Moderate

[dzikoysk](/dzikoysk)
published

Jun 17, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 3.3.0

## Patched versions

3.5.12

## Description

### Summary

Reposilite v3.5.10 is affected by an Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability via path traversal in expanding of Javadoc archives.

### Details

Reposilite provides support for JavaDocs files, which are archives that contain documentation for artifacts. Specifically, [JavadocEndpoints.kt](https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/blob/68b73f19dc9811ccf10936430cf17f7b0e622bd6/reposilite-backend/src/main/kotlin/com/reposilite/javadocs/infrastructure/JavadocEndpoints.kt#L28) controller allows to expand the javadoc archive into the server's file system and return its content. The problem is in the way how the archives are expanded, specifically how the new filename is created:

[JavadocContainerService.kt#L127-L136](https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/blob/68b73f19dc9811ccf10936430cf17f7b0e622bd6/reposilite-backend/src/main/kotlin/com/reposilite/javadocs/JavadocContainerService.kt#L127-L136)

```
jarFile.entries().asSequence().forEach { file ->
    if (file.isDirectory) {
        return@forEach
    }

     val path = Paths.get(javadocUnpackPath.toString() + "/" + file.name)

    path.parent?.also { parent -> Files.createDirectories(parent) }
    jarFile.getInputStream(file).copyToAndClose(path.outputStream())
}.asSuccess<Unit, ErrorResponse>()
```

The `file.name` taken from the archive can contain path traversal characters, such as '/../../../anything.txt', so the resulting extraction path can be outside the target directory.

### Impact

If the archive is taken from an untrusted source, such as Maven Central or JitPack for example, an attacker can craft a special archive to overwrite any local file on Reposilite instance. This could lead to remote code execution, for example by placing a new plugin into the '$workspace$/plugins' directory. Alternatively, an attacker can overwrite the content of any other package.

Note that the attacker can use its own malicious package from Maven Central to overwrite any other package on Reposilite.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a malicious javadoc archive that contains filenames with path traversal characters:

```
zip test-1.0-javadoc.jar ../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.txt index.html
```

Make sure that `../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.txt` and `index.html` files exist on the system where you create this archive.

2. Publish this archive to the repository which Reposilite is mirroring, such as Maven Central or JitPack. For the test purposes, I used my own server that imitates the upstream maven repository:

   <http://artsploit.com/maven/com/artsploit/reposilite-zipslip/1.0/reposilite-zipslip-1.0-javadoc.jar>
3. Start Reposilite with 'releases' repository mirroring to '<http://artsploit.com/maven/>'
4. Now, if the attacker send the request to <http://localhost:8080/javadoc/releases/com/artsploit/reposilite-zipslip/1.0>, the aforementioned archive will be obtained from the <http://artsploit.com/maven/com/artsploit/reposilite-zipslip/1.0/reposilite-zipslip-1.0-javadoc.jar> address and its 'evil.txt' file will be expanded to '$workspace$/tmp/evil.txt'. Note that to perform this action, an attacker does not need to provide any credentials, as fetching from the mirrored repository does not require authentication.
5. Confirm that '$workspace$/tmp/evil.txt' is created on the server where Reposilite is running.

### Remediation

Normalize (remove all occurrences of `/../`) the `file.name` variable before concatenating it with `javadocUnpackPath`. E.g.:

```
val path = Paths.get(javadocUnpackPath.toString() + "/" + Paths.get(file.name).normalize().toString())
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

**Security**

In a collaboration with [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) *(big thanks to [@artsploit](https://github.com/artsploit) 🤍)* we've managed to resolve 3 vulnerabilities noticed in Reposilite:

* GHSL-2024-072
* GHSL-2024-073
* GHSL-2024-074

It is highly recommended to update your instances as soon as possible to mitigate the risks. For the time being, we're not revealing details on each one of them, but every instance running on versions between 3.3.0 to 3.5.11 should be considered as vulnerable.

We also recommend regenerating your access tokens, because those could be leaked via malicious Javadocs archives. As long as it's unlikely that you were affected, it's a general good practice in such cases.

**Other changes**

* Fixed invalid SHA checksums generated for files uploaded via the dashboard *(thanks [@laszlof](https://github.com/laszlof))*
* Bumped dependencies
