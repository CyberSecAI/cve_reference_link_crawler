Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient path sanitization when extracting files from a Javadoc archive. The `file.name` taken directly from the archive is used to construct the extraction path, without proper sanitization, allowing path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The application fails to sanitize the filenames from the archive, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences like `../` to write files outside the intended directory.
- Arbitrary File Upload/Overwrite: Due to the path traversal vulnerability, an attacker can upload or overwrite arbitrary files on the server running Reposilite.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By placing a malicious plugin in the '$workspace$/plugins' directory or overwriting other packages, an attacker could achieve remote code execution.
- Data Integrity Compromise: An attacker could overwrite existing files, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation.
- Potential for Information Disclosure (though not explicitly mentioned, overwriting files could leak sensitive data if the overwritten file is later accessed)

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted request to the Reposilite instance.
- Uploading a malicious Javadoc archive via a mirrored repository (e.g. Maven Central, JitPack).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to publish a malicious javadoc archive to a repository that is mirrored by the vulnerable Reposilite instance.
- The attacker does not require authentication for the initial step of fetching from the mirrored repository.
- The attacker needs to know the request format to trigger the extraction of the malicious javadoc file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Reposilite versions 3.3.0 to 3.5.11.
- The vulnerability is located in `JavadocContainerService.kt`.
- The fix involves normalizing (removing `/../` sequences) from `file.name` before constructing the destination path.
- The vulnerability was reported by artsploit.
- The CVSS score is 6.8, with an attack vector of Network, high complexity, low privileges, no user interaction, unchanged scope, high confidentiality impact, high integrity impact and no availability impact.
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory).

The provided content includes a commit that attempts to fix the vulnerability, using the following logic:
```kotlin
   val processedArchiveFileLocation = file.name.toLocation()
    
    processedArchiveFileLocation
        .toPath()
        .map { javadocUnpackPath.resolve(it) }
        .peek {
            it.parent?.also { parent -> Files.createDirectories(parent) }
            jarFile.getInputStream(file).copyToAndClose(it.outputStream())
        }
        .onError {
            failureFacade.throwException(
                "Malicious resource path detected: $processedArchiveFileLocation in $jarPath",
                IllegalArgumentException("Malicious resource path detected: $it")
            )
        }
```
This attempts to convert the file name to a location, which will trigger the sanitization implemented in the toPath() method.
