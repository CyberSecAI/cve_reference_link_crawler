Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `edit_user.php` file of the Kashipara College Management System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This occurs because the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the `edit_user.php` file is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
  - Leaking of sensitive user data and system data.
  - Potential compromise of system security.
  - Malicious users gaining unauthorized access and control.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `edit_user.php` file. By manipulating this parameter with malicious SQL code, an attacker can inject SQL commands into the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have the ability to manipulate the `id` parameter within the request to include SQL injection payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The provided payload `id=(select(0)from(select(sleep(8)))v)` demonstrates how an attacker could inject a sleep function to verify the existence of the SQL injection vulnerability. This payload attempts to introduce a time delay by utilizing the `sleep()` function within the SQL query, thereby confirming a successful injection.
- The vulnerable system is Kashipara College Management System version 1.0 or lower.
