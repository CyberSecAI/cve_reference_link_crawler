- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VOD Infomaniak WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when users visit the site. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including user redirection, data theft, and defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through user inputs or other means. The specific input vector is not detailed in this document but the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious script into a vulnerable area of the plugin. The attacker does not need to have any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
