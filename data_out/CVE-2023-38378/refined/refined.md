Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `changepwd.cgi` binary. This occurs because the program uses the `system()` function to execute a shell command constructed with user-supplied input, specifically the new password (`pass1`).  The program also incorrectly checks the old password (`pass0`) by comparing it to a stored password using `strncmp` with a length parameter derived from the length of the user-provided `pass0`, which can be zero, allowing the check to be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection:** The `system()` function is used to execute a shell command (`echo admin:user_password > /rigol/data/user.conf`) which includes user-controlled input (`pass1`). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by inserting special characters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`) in `pass1`.
*   **Insecure Password Check:** The `strncmp` function is used to compare the old password with the user-provided value, but the length parameter is obtained using `strlen()` on the user-provided old password (`pass0`). Passing an empty string makes the length zero, effectively bypassing the check.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code lacks proper sanitization of user-provided input before constructing the shell command or comparing password strings.
*   **Cleartext Storage of Password:** The password is stored in clear text inside the `/rigol/data/user.conf` file, instead of being hashed or encrypted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the RIGOL oscilloscope. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including:
*   **Full System Compromise:** Complete control over the oscilloscope's system.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Modification:**  Access and manipulation of sensitive data stored on the device.
*   **Denial of Service:** Rendering the oscilloscope unusable.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Potentially using the compromised oscilloscope as a foothold to attack other systems on the same network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network via HTTP requests to the web interface.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/changepwd.cgi` endpoint. The request must include form data with the keys `pass0` and `pass1` and the values for these keys are used to bypass the password check and inject commands.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the RIGOL oscilloscope.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web interface of the vulnerable RIGOL oscilloscope over the network (e.g., same LAN, or exposed via internet).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerable code is part of a CGI binary.
*   The vulnerability is present due to a combination of poor coding practices including use of system(), lack of sanitization of user-controlled input and poor understanding of the `strncmp` function.
*   The attacker can use a simple `curl` command to exploit this vulnerability
*   The provided article includes detailed steps on how to emulate the oscilloscope firmware to test this vulnerability, as well as the exploit itself.
