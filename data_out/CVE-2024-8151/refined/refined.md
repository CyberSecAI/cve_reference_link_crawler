Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `mark` parameter in the `delete-mark.php` file of the Sourcecodester Interactive Map with Marker 1.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input (`mark` parameter) before displaying it on the webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** With malicious JavaScript, the attacker can potentially steal session cookies.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could read or modify data within the application.
- **Defacement:** An attacker can alter the appearance of the website.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the victim to a malicious website or force the download of malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** An attacker can manipulate the `mark` parameter in the HTTP GET request to `delete-mark.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the `mark` parameter in `delete-mark.php` is vulnerable.
- **Ability to Intercept or Craft Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the request, for example via a proxy like Burp Suite or through their own custom script.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `mark` in `delete-mark.php`
- The provided XSS payload is: `%3cIMG%20%22%22%22%3e%3cSCRIPT%3ealert(%22XSS%22)%3c%2fSCRIPT%3e%22%3e` which decodes to `<IMG """"><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">`
- This payload demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

**Summary of the Exploitation:**
1. The attacker crafts a malicious URL or HTTP request to `delete-mark.php` which contains the XSS payload in the `mark` parameter.
2. When the victim's browser makes a request to the vulnerable page including the crafted payload, the web server will return a response with the attacker's malicious script within the HTML.
3. The victim's browser executes the malicious JavaScript, leading to an XSS attack.
