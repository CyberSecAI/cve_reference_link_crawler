[**sqli\_delete\_blood\_blank.md**](#file-sqli_delete_blood_blank-md)

## **Affected Version:**

* **BloodBank Management System**: 1.0

## **Vulnerability Information:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection (Time-Based Blind)
* **Severity:** HIGH
* **Status:** Unpatched

## **Vulnerable Endpoint:**

* `/file/delete.php?bid=6`

## **Vulnerability Description:**

A **time-based SQL Injection vulnerability** was discovered in the **delete request functionality** of the **BloodBank Management System** version 1.0. This vulnerability occurs because the `bid` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands into the backend database query.

This attack relies on a **blind SQL injection technique**, where the attacker uses time-based delays (via the **`BENCHMARK` function**) to infer if the injection was successful. If the system delays its response, the attacker knows the SQL query was executed, allowing them to:

* **Tamper with or delete sensitive records** (e.g., blood bank data).
* **Extract data slowly** by chaining multiple queries.
* **Cause Denial of Service (DoS)** by overloading the system with intensive queries.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Below is a **GET** request demonstrating the vulnerability using a **time-based SQL injection payload**:

```
GET /file/delete.php?bid=3'%20AND%204994%3dBENCHMARK(5000000%2cMD5(0x51494778))--%20ntES HTTP/1.1

```
### **Explanation:**

This payload injects the SQL command:

```
' AND 4994=BENCHMARK(5000000, MD5(0x51494778))-- ntES
```

This causes the backend to execute **5,000,000 MD5 operations**, significantly delaying the response if the query executes correctly. The delay confirms that the system is vulnerable to SQL injection.

## **Impact:**

* **Data Integrity Compromise:** Attackers can delete or modify blood bank records.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated injections can exhaust system resources, making the application unresponsive.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to further explore the database and escalate privileges.

---

## **Mitigation Recommendations:**

1. **Use Prepared Statements:** Employ parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize the `bid` parameter to allow only expected values (e.g., numeric IDs).
3. **Database Permissions:** Restrict database user privileges to limit the potential damage of SQL injections.
4. **Monitoring & Logging:** Track and alert unusual patterns, such as slow queries or repetitive access attempts.
5. **Security Testing:** Perform regular penetration testing and code reviews to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
6. **Error Handling:** Avoid exposing database-related errors in responses, which may assist attackers.
