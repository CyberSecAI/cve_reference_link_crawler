The content relates to CVE-2024-42461.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing checks during the decoding of signatures in the `elliptic` library, specifically for ECDSA and EDDSA algorithms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **EDDSA:** Missing length check during signature creation allows appending or removing zero bytes from the signature, leading to malleability.
2.  **ECDSA:**
    *   Missing check if the leading bit of r and s is zero in DER encoded signatures. According to the ASN.1 standard, leading bits for r and s should be zero.
    *   Allowing BER-encoded signatures instead of enforcing DER, creating ambiguity and potential malleability. Leading zeros for length sequences in DER encoding should be rejected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The malleability issues could allow attackers to modify signatures without invalidating them. This could potentially lead to:
   - Tampering of transactions and data.
   - Bypassing signature verification.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit these weaknesses by crafting or manipulating signatures:
*   For EDDSA, by adding or removing leading zero bytes.
*   For ECDSA, by including signatures with non-zero leading bits for 'r' and 's' values or by crafting BER-encoded signatures with leading zeros in length fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to manipulate signatures before they are verified using the vulnerable `elliptic` library. This could be achieved by:
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks where the attacker can intercept and modify signatures in transit.
*   Compromise of systems that are creating/verifying signatures using the vulnerable library.
