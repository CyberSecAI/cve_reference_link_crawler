## Installation

### One-click Known sites

If you want to install on your own web space, we recommend [Reclaim Hosting](https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/aff.php?aff=013),
which includes one-click Known installation. Known is also known to work on [DreamHost](https://dreamhost.com), a high-quality
web hosting provider.

### Installing

Known is under active development and requires PHP 8.1+ with selected extensions, together with a supported database backend. You can find detailed installation instructions here: <http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/install/index.html>

#### Installing from packages

*Unofficial* install packages, which are periodically built from the latest code, are available: <https://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/known/>

#### Installing from Github

You can opt to check out the work-in-progress development code from the git repository: <https://github.com/idno/known>

* Check out the repo: `git clone https://github.com/idno/known.git`
* Fetch dependencies: `cd known; composer install`

#### Installing with composer

You can install Known directly from composer using: `composer create-project idno/known`

Optionally, you can install the latest bleeding edge code the same way: `composer create-project idno/known -s dev`
