  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2021-4411",
      "description": "The WP EasyPay â€“ Square for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpep_download_transaction_in_excel() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger a transactions download via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a missing nonce check in the `wpep_download_transaction_in_excel` function. The code checks for the presence of the nonce but does not enforce its verification if the nonce is not present in the request.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can trick an administrator into downloading transaction data via a forged request, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a forged request, likely triggered by a user interaction like clicking a malicious link.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a crafted URL.",
       "additional_info": {
           "vulnerable_code": "if ( ! isset($_POST['nonce']) && ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_key($_POST['nonce']), 'nonce' )  ) {\n   die('access denied! Nonce not verify.');\n}",

    {
      "cve": "CVE-2021-4411",
         "description": "The WP EasyPay plugin, version 3.2.0 and below, has a CSRF vulnerability where if the `$_POST['nonce']` variable is set, the nonce verification won't be performed. ",
      "root_cause": "The plugin fails to properly validate nonces, specifically in the `wpep_setup.php` file, the nonce check within the conditional statement only triggers if the nonce is set, otherwise, the check is bypassed. `if ( ! isset($_POST['nonce']) && ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_key($_POST['nonce']), 'nonce' )  )`. This logic dictates that if `$_POST['nonce']` is not set, no check will occur. ",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit this to bypass security checks and perform actions on behalf of a logged-in admin, leading to unauthorized settings changes, potentially arbitrary code execution, or data modification depending on the actions that are vulnerable.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack is conducted through a crafted request that targets the vulnerable functions in the plugin. This is done through social engineering an admin to access a forged link, and could lead to full site take over.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in administrator to click on a crafted link, and will have to know the nonce parameter name.",
