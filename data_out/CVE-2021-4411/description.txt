The WP EasyPay â€“ Square for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpep_download_transaction_in_excel() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger a transactions download via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
