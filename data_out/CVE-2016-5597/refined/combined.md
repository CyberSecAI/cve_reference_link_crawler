## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [openjdk-7](/security/cves?package=openjdk-7) - Open Source Java implementation

## Details

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not restrict the set of algorithms used

for Jar integrity verification. An attacker could use this to modify

without detection the content of a JAR file, affecting system integrity.

([CVE-2016-5542](/security/CVE-2016-5542))

It was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK did not sufficiently

perform classloader consistency checks. An attacker could use this to

bypass Java sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5554](/security/CVE-2016-5554))

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly

check received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could

use this to send debugging commands to a Java application with debugging

enabled. ([CVE-2016-5573](/security/CVE-2016-5573))

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly

check arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An

attacker could use this to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

([CVE-2016-5582](/security/CVE-2016-5582))

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly handle HTTP proxy

authentication. An attacker could use this to expose HTTPS server

authentication credentials. ([CVE-2016-5597](/security/CVE-2016-5597))

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0061)

## Topic

An update for java-1.6.0-openjdk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
5, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives
a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.6.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment
and the OpenJDK 6 Java Software Development Kit.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check

arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An untrusted Java
application or applet could use this flaw to corrupt virtual machine's memory
and completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5582)

* It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check

received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could possibly use
this flaw to send debugging commands to a Java program running with debugging
enabled if they could make victim's browser send HTTP requests to the JDWP port
of the debugged application. (CVE-2016-5573)

* It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not restrict the

set of algorithms used for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an
attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash
algorithm. (CVE-2016-5542)

Note: After this update, MD2 hash algorithm and RSA keys with less than 1024
bits are no longer allowed to be used for Jar integrity verification by default.
MD5 hash algorithm is expected to be disabled by default in the future updates.
A newly introduced security property jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms can be used to
control the set of disabled algorithms.

* A flaw was found in the way the JMX component of OpenJDK handled classloaders.

An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain
Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5554)

* A flaw was found in the way the Networking component of OpenJDK handled HTTP

proxy authentication. A Java application could possibly expose HTTPS server
authentication credentials via a plain text network connection to an HTTP proxy
if proxy asked for authentication. (CVE-2016-5597)

Note: After this update, Basic HTTP proxy authentication can no longer be used
when tunneling HTTPS connection through an HTTP proxy. Newly introduced system
properties jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes and
jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes can be used to control which
authentication schemes can be requested by an HTTP proxy when proxying HTTP and
HTTPS connections respectively.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in
this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running instances of OpenJDK Java must be restarted for this update to take
effect.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [openjdk-6](/security/cves?package=openjdk-6) - Open Source Java implementation

## Details

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not restrict the set of algorithms used

for Jar integrity verification. An attacker could use this to modify

without detection the content of a JAR file, affecting system integrity.

([CVE-2016-5542](/security/CVE-2016-5542))

It was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK did not sufficiently

perform classloader consistency checks. An attacker could use this to

bypass Java sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5554](/security/CVE-2016-5554))

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly

check received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could

use this to send debugging commands to a Java application with debugging

enabled. ([CVE-2016-5573](/security/CVE-2016-5573))

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly

check arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An

attacker could use this to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

([CVE-2016-5582](/security/CVE-2016-5582))

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly handle HTTP proxy

authentication. An attacker could use this to expose HTTPS server

authentication credentials. ([CVE-2016-5597](/security/CVE-2016-5597))

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2658)

## Topic

An update for java-1.7.0-openjdk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
5, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives
a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.7.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 7 Java Runtime Environment
and the OpenJDK 7 Java Software Development Kit.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check

arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An untrusted Java
application or applet could use this flaw to corrupt virtual machine's memory
and completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5582)

* It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check

received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could possibly use
this flaw to send debugging commands to a Java program running with debugging
enabled if they could make victim's browser send HTTP requests to the JDWP port
of the debugged application. (CVE-2016-5573)

* It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not restrict the

set of algorithms used for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an
attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash
algorithm. (CVE-2016-5542)

Note: After this update, MD2 hash algorithm and RSA keys with less than 1024
bits are no longer allowed to be used for Jar integrity verification by default.
MD5 hash algorithm is expected to be disabled by default in the future updates.
A newly introduced security property jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms can be used to
control the set of disabled algorithms.

* A flaw was found in the way the JMX component of OpenJDK handled classloaders.

An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain
Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5554)

* A flaw was found in the way the Networking component of OpenJDK handled HTTP

proxy authentication. A Java application could possibly expose HTTPS server
authentication credentials via a plain text network connection to an HTTP proxy
if proxy asked for authentication. (CVE-2016-5597)

Note: After this update, Basic HTTP proxy authentication can no longer be used
when tunneling HTTPS connection through an HTTP proxy. Newly introduced system
properties jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes and
jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes can be used to control which
authentication schemes can be requested by an HTTP proxy when proxying HTTP and
HTTPS connections respectively.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in
this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running instances of OpenJDK Java must be restarted for this update to take
effect.

# IcedTea: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-43**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IcedTea allowing remote
attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability through
various vectors.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/icedtea-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.2.6.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.2.6.8**>= **3.2.0** |

### Background

IcedTea’s aim is to provide OpenJDK in a form suitable for easy
configuration, compilation and distribution with the primary goal of
allowing inclusion in GNU/Linux distributions.

### Description

Various OpenJDK attack vectors in IcedTea, such as 2D, Corba, Hotspot,
Libraries, and JAXP, exist which allows remote attackers to affect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of vulnerable systems. Many
of the vulnerabilities can only be exploited through sandboxed Java Web
Start applications and java applets. Please review the CVE identifiers
referenced below for details.

### Impact

Remote attackers may execute arbitrary code, compromise information, or
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All IcedTea-bin 7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-7.2.6.8:7"

```

All IcedTea-bin 3.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-3.2.0:8"

```

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2079)

## Topic

An update for java-1.8.0-openjdk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.8.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 8 Java Software Development Kit.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to corrupt virtual machine's memory and completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5582)
* It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to send debugging commands to a Java program running with debugging enabled if they could make victim's browser send HTTP requests to the JDWP port of the debugged application. (CVE-2016-5573)
* It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not restrict the set of algorithms used for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash algorithm. (CVE-2016-5542)

Note: After this update, MD2 hash algorithm and RSA keys with less than 1024 bits are no longer allowed to be used for Jar integrity verification by default. MD5 hash algorithm is expected to be disabled by default in the future updates. A newly introduced security property jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms can be used to control the set of disabled algorithms.

* A flaw was found in the way the JMX component of OpenJDK handled classloaders. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5554)
* A flaw was found in the way the Networking component of OpenJDK handled HTTP proxy authentication. A Java application could possibly expose HTTPS server authentication credentials via a plain text network connection to an HTTP proxy if proxy asked for authentication. (CVE-2016-5597)

Note: After this update, Basic HTTP proxy authentication can no longer be used when tunneling HTTPS connection through an HTTP proxy. Newly introduced system properties jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes and jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes can be used to control which authentication schemes can be requested by an HTTP proxy when proxying HTTP and HTTPS connections respectively.

Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running instances of OpenJDK Java must be restarted for this update to take effect.
