```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromDhcpListClient` function due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `list1` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The overflow overrides the `LISTEN` pointer variable. Subsequent execution of `atoi` with the overwritten pointer leads to a crash, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/DhcpListClient` endpoint, with a crafted `list1` parameter that contains a large payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device's web interface."
