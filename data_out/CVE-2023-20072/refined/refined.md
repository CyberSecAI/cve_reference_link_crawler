- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of large fragmented tunnel protocol packets in Cisco IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of fragmented packets. Specifically, the fragmentation handling code for tunnel protocol packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted fragmented packets to an affected system. The vulnerability is triggered via traffic directed to the affected system's tunnel interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted fragmented packets to a vulnerable Cisco IOS XE device that has a tunnel interface configured. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

The advisory states that the vulnerability is present in Cisco IOS XE Software releases 17.9.1, 17.9.1a, or 17.9.1w if a tunnel interface is configured.
