- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stemmed from sending information over the network without using HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of encryption for network communication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in a privileged network position could intercept network traffic.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, specifically Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, due to the lack of HTTPS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, meaning they have some control or visibility over the network traffic.
