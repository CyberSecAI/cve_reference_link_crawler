**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper memory initialization during the parsing of SKP files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An uninitialized memory access vulnerability exists in the SKP file parsing process.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction. The victim must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious SKP file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious SKP file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when a user interacts with it via the SketchUp Viewer.
