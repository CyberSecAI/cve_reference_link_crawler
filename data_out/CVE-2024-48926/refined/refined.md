{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Backoffice displays the logout page with a session timeout message before the server session has fully expired.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system prematurely displays a logout message, which is not synchronized with the actual server session expiration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users may believe they have been logged out approximately 30 seconds before they actually are, potentially causing confusion and minor disruption. The impact is relatively low.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No specific attacker capabilities or position are described, but the network vector suggests it's remotely exploitable."
