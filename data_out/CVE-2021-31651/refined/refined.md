- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows an administrator to inject malicious JavaScript code within the copyright setting in the background. This code is then executed when a user accesses the foreground.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the copyright setting before rendering it in the foreground.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, leading to potential actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be logged in as an administrator to access the copyright settings. Once the malicious payload is entered, it is stored and executed when users access the application's foreground.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the copyright settings in the backend.
