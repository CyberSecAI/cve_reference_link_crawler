Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Grafana Image Renderer plugin, when using HTTP remote rendering, embeds a Chromium browser that allows for printing of files. This functionality can be exploited to disclose unauthorized files by rendering them as PNG images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthorized file disclosure: The Chromium browser within the image renderer can be manipulated to "print" files, making their content accessible via a rendered PNG image.
- Lack of proper access control: The renderer does not adequately restrict which files it can access and render.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of sensitive information: An attacker can potentially access and retrieve unauthorized files from the server where the image renderer is running.
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could potentially target extremely large files, causing resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP remote rendering: The vulnerability is triggered when the Grafana Image Renderer is used with HTTP remote rendering enabled.
- Network conditions or fake datasource: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability under certain network configurations or by utilizing a fake datasource, if the attacker has admin access to Grafana.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileges: An attacker needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the Grafana instance.
- Knowledge of how to use the HTTP rendering functionality, potentially including manipulation of data sources or specific network configurations.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is associated with CVE-2022-31176.
- The CVSS score is 8.3 (High) CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H
- Affected versions of Grafana Image Renderer are <= 3.5.0, and the patched version is 3.6.1
- The vulnerability affects Grafana instances that use the Grafana Image Renderer plugin.
-  The fix involves upgrading the Grafana instance and Image Renderer docker image, setting a strong secret in `renderer_token`, configuring the same secret for the Image Renderer, and restarting both services. A workaround is to disable HTTP remote rendering or stop using the plugin.
