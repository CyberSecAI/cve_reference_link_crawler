Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) and as always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. This is also applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana.

## Unauthorized file disclosure (CVE-2022-31176)

### Summary

On July 21 an internal security review identified an unauthorized file disclosure vulnerability in the Grafana Image Renderer plugin when [HTTP remote rendering](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-image-renderer/) is used.

The Chromium browser embedded in the Grafana image renderer allows for ‘printing’ of unauthorized files in a PNG file. This makes it possible for a malicious user to retrieve unauthorized files under some network conditions or via a fake datasource (if the user has admin permissions in Grafana). This vulnerability permits unauthorized file disclosure and is a potential DoS vector through targeting of extremely large files.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.3 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H) for Grafana instances using [Grafana Image Renderer](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-image-renderer/) plugin with HTTP remote rendering.

### Impacted versions

All Grafana installations with the [Grafana Image Renderer](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-image-renderer/) plugin used with HTTP remote rendering are affected by this vulnerability.

### Solutions and mitigations

All Grafana installations and the Grafana Image Renderer plugin should be upgraded as soon as possible by following all the steps below. They are only required if you are using the Image Renderer plugin with HTTP remote rendering.

* Upgrade your Grafana instance
* Upgrade your Image Renderer docker image with the Docker image `grafana/grafana-image-renderer:3.6.1`
* In the rendering section of Grafana configuration file, define a strong secret in `renderer_token`
* Configure the same secret for the Image Renderer either via an environment variable called `AUTH_TOKEN` or by adding `auth_token` config key in the `[plugin.grafana-image-renderer]` section of Grafana config.
* Restart your Grafana instance
* Restart your Image Renderer docker image

If you can’t upgrade, as a workaround it is possible to [disable HTTP remote rendering](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#plugingrafana-image-renderer), or stop using Grafana Image Renderer plugin entirely.

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
