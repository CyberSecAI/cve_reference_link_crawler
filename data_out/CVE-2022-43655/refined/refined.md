- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it into a fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing FBX files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious FBX file or visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious FBX file or control a malicious page that the victim will open/visit. User interaction is required.
