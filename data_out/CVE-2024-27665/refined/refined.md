Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling file uploads in the Syllabus module of Unifiedtransform v2.X. Specifically, the application doesn't sanitize the content of uploaded PDF files, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to Stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is injected within a PDF file and stored on the server. When a user downloads the syllabus, this malicious code gets executed within the user's browser context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser when they download the malicious file. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacement, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector involves using the file upload feature in the Syllabus module. By uploading a specially crafted PDF file with a malicious XSS payload, an attacker can inject the payload into the application.
- **Download Trigger:** The XSS payload is triggered when a user navigates to the "Classes -> Syllabus" section and downloads the malicious PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account with access to the application and the ability to navigate to the Academic and Syllabus modules.
- **File upload capability:** The attacker needs to be able to upload PDF files to the Syllabus module.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content includes step-by-step instructions and screenshots (Proof of Concept) to demonstrate how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The XSS payload is embedded within a PDF file.
