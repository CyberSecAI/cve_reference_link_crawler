###### SUMMARY

### MXsecurity Series Multiple Vulnerabilities

* Security Advisory ID: MPSA-230403
* Version: V1.1
* Release Date: Sep 01, 2023
* Reference:
  + [CVE-2023-39979 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39979)
  + [CVE-2023-39980 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39980)
  + [CVE-2023-39981 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39981)
  + [CVE-2023-39982 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39982)
  + [CVE-2023-39983 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39983)

These vulnerabilities are caused by the improper design or implementation of authentication mechanisms and input validation. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could enable an attacker to bypass authentication, which could lead to the unauthorized disclosure or tampering of authenticated information, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and remote access without proper authorization.

| Item | Vulnerability Type | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Small Space of Random Values (CWE-334) CVE-2023-39979 | An attacker can bypass authentication to gain unauthorized access. |
| 2 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-89) CVE-2023-39980 | An attacker can change the SQL command to gain unauthorized access to disclose information. |
| 3 | Improper Authentication (CWE-287) CVE-2023-39981 | An attacker can gain unauthorized access to disclose device information. |
| 4 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798) CVE-2023-39982 | An attacker can facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks and enable the decryption of SSH traffic. |
| 5 | Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes (CWE-915) CVE-2023-39983 | An attacker can register/add a device via the nsm-web application. |

###### AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS

## Affected Products:

The affected products and firmware versions are shown below.

| Product Series | Affected Versions |
| --- | --- |
| MXsecurity Series | Software version v1.0.1 and prior versions |

## Solutions:

Moxa has developed appropriate solutions to address the vulnerabilities. The solutions for affected products are shown below.

| Product Series | Solutions |

## **Mitigation**

* Minimize network exposure to ensure the device is not accessible from the Internet.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
* The starting point of all the above vulnerabilities is from the web service, so it is suggested to disable web service temporarily if you completed configuration to prevent further damages from these vulnerabilities until installed patch or updated firmware.
