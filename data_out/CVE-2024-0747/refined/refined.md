Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-0747:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles Content Security Policy (CSP) when a parent page loads a child page within an iframe and uses `document.write()`. Specifically, when a parent page with `unsafe-inline` CSP loads a child iframe, the parent's CSP could incorrectly override the child's CSP, if the child's document is modified using `document.write()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **CSP Bypass:** The core issue is a bypass of the intended CSP rules.  The child's CSP, defined with `default-src 'none'`, which should block inline scripts, is overridden by the parent's `unsafe-inline` CSP due to improper handling of `document.write()`.
- **Incorrect CSP Inheritance:** The browser incorrectly inherits the parent's CSP when the iframe's content is modified via `document.write()`, instead of preserving the iframe's originally defined CSP.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Unintended Script Execution:** An attacker can bypass the child's stricter CSP and inject and execute arbitrary inline JavaScript code within the iframe. This can lead to various attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) if the attacker manages to control the parent page.
- **Compromise of Protected Resources:** Depending on the specifics of the application, injected scripts could access sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Iframe Injection:** The attacker needs to inject a malicious iframe into a vulnerable parent page or control the parent page to load a malicious iframe with an unsafe-inline CSP.
- **`document.write()` manipulation:** The parent page uses `document.write()` to modify the iframe's document, triggering the incorrect CSP inheritance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the content of a parent page to inject a malicious iframe or the attacker needs to control the parent page directly.
- The attacker needs to cause the parent page to use `document.write()` to modify the content of the iframe.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug report on Bugzilla indicates that the issue is related to how the browser handles `document.open()` which is implicitly called by `document.write()`. Instead of treating the operation as modifying the existing document, the browser was creating a new document from scratch without proper inheritance of the original CSP.
- Other browsers (Chrome, Edge, and Safari) correctly enforce the child page's CSP in similar scenarios.
- The fix involves removing steps in `Document::Open` that are not derived from the specification, which were causing the incorrect CSP inheritance.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 122 and Firefox ESR 115.7, as well as Thunderbird 115.7.
- This vulnerability is considered a moderate security risk.
