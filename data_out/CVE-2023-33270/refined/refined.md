- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `url` parameter within the cURL check function of DTS Monitoring 3.57.0 is vulnerable to OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary OS commands through the `url` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the server hosting DTS Monitoring. This can lead to a full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ajax.php` endpoint. The `url` parameter within the `check_params` is injected with malicious commands using command substitution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the DTS monitoring instance and must be able to access the `/ajax.php` endpoint. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
