- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Arigato Autoresponder and Newsletter plugin for WordPress, in versions 2.7.2.2 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin, under the user's authentication. The specific impact can vary on a case by case basis.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into executing it, typically through social engineering (e.g., sending a link).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user (with sufficient privileges) to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious website containing the crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
