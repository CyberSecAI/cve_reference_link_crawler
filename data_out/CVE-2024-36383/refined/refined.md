Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `state` parameter within the SAML SSO-URL response. This allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:** The injected content within the `state` parameter is used in a way that allows for arbitrary file deletion. This indicates that the injected content likely controls, at least in part, the path or filename that is targeted for deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Successful exploitation leads to the deletion of files on the system.
*   **Denial of Service:** The arbitrary file deletion can lead to users being unable to log in using SAML authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Injection:** An attacker injects malicious content into the `state` parameter of the SAML SSO-URL response. This is done through manipulation of the SAML response, likely by intercepting and modifying the response from the Identity Provider.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to intercept and modify the SAML response.
*   **SAML knowledge:**  Understanding of SAML authentication flows is necessary to craft malicious payloads.
*   **Man-in-the-middle:** The attacker likely needs a position in the network to intercept the SAML response.
