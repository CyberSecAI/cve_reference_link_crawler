- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IFrame Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts into the website, leading to redirects, advertisements, or other malicious HTML payloads being executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the plugin's input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a WordPress contributor to inject the malicious code.
