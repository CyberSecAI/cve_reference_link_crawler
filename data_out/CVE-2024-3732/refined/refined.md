Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `gd_single_tabs` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes used in the `gd_single_tabs` shortcode. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `gd_single_tabs` shortcode.
- An attacker injects malicious script within an attribute of the shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site.
- **Contributor or higher access:**  The attacker needs at least contributor-level access to create or edit content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the GeoDirectory plugin up to and including version 2.3.48.
- The fix was implemented in version 2.3.49, which includes additional sanitization for shortcode tag selectors
