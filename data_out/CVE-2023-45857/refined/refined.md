Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Axios library including the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header with the value of the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie in **all** requests to any server when the `withCredentials` setting is enabled and the cookie exists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359):** The `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie value, intended for CSRF protection, is being disclosed to third-party hosts, thus potentially allowing unauthorized access to this sensitive information.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass potential:** By obtaining the `XSRF-TOKEN` value, a malicious actor could potentially bypass the CSRF defense mechanism of a web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** The `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie value, which should be kept confidential, is exposed.
- **CSRF defense bypass:** An attacker could potentially bypass CSRF protections.
-  The impact is rated as **High** with a CVSS score of 7.1

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-domain requests:** The vulnerability is triggered when a cross-domain request is made using an Axios instance with the `withCredentials` option enabled.
- **Client-side JavaScript access:** The `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie needs to be accessible to client-side JavaScript for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to:
    -  Make a request to a server that uses axios
    -  Intercept or obtain the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie when the `withCredentials` flag is enabled in the axios client.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Axios versions from `v0.8.1` to `v1.5.1` and likely all versions released since commit `415ff773cc01cd52a9eeafc2c9c28cc0d94f8db3`
- The vulnerability is present when the `withCredentials` flag is set to `true` regardless of whether the cookie is created on the client or server side.
- A fix was introduced in a later version of `axios` by not sending the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header on cross-domain requests.
- The vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID `CVE-2023-45857`.
- A temporary workaround is to change the default XSRF-TOKEN cookie name in the Axios configuration and manually include the corresponding header only in the specific places where it's necessary.
