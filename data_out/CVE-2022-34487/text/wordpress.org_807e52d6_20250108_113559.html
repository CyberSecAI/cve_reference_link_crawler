From distance looks good and has many codes, but in real life, it`s very dangerous. In my case, it messed up my whole web page. Had to disable the plugin to get it working again. No help from the support either :/ BE CAREFUL

Got a license a year ago, tested it but didn’t have a use for it before today. Today the plugin is blank. It’s nothing there. I can add my license, but that’s it.
The website with all documentation and codes for download is deleted. The links for the plugin from the main page (Oxilab) go nowhere.
yeah, I would probably don’t purchase this if I were you.
