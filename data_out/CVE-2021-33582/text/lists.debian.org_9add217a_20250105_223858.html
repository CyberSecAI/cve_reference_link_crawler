Package        : cyrus-imapd
Version        : 2.5.10-3+deb9u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18928 CVE-2021-33582
Debian Bug     : 993433

It was discovered that the Cyrus IMAP server was prone to a denial of service
attack via input that is mishandled during hash-table interaction. Furthermore
it allowed privilege escalation because an HTTP request may be interpreted in
the authentication context of an unrelated previous request that arrived over
the same connection.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.5.10-3+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd packages.

For the detailed security status of cyrus-imapd please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cyrus-imapd>
