| Please clean up the "poc" file to only keep the commands that matter. Most of the garbage is probably irrelevant. |

| I cleaned up. I can reproduce it with the latest vim-8.2.2348:  ``` $ cd vim/src $ ./vim --clean -c'au * * blast' -c'edit foo1' -c'au * foo* ball' -c'edit foo2' Vim: Caught deadly signal SEGV Vim: Finished.

Doing `au * * ...` is a bit crazy. Perhaps we can narrow down further to a few aucommands events instead of all events. |
