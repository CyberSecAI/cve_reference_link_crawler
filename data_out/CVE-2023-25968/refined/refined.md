- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows attackers to force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through crafted requests that, when triggered by a logged-in user, will execute an action without the user's consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with higher privileges to execute an action. The attacker does not need any authentication.
