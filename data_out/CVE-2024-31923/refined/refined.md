- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Feather Login Page plugin <= 1.1.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, could execute unintended actions on the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a forged form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
