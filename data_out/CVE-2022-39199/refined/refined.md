{
  "CVE-2022-39199": {
    "description": "The immudb client SDKs use the server's UUID to differentiate between different server instances, allowing the client to connect to multiple immudb instances and maintain their respective states. The SDK does not validate this UUID, accepting any value reported by the server. A malicious server could exploit this by changing the reported UUID, tricking the client into treating it as a different server and accepting a state irrelevant to the previously retrieved one.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of proper validation of server UUID by the client SDK.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-345"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious server can change the reported UUID, causing the client to treat it as a different server and accept a state that is irrelevant to the one previously retrieved. This could lead to the client using invalid proofs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the server to manipulate the server UUID.",
