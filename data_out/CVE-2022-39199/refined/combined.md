# Lack of proper validation of server UUID can be used by the server to trick the client to accept invalid proofs

Moderate

[byo](/byo)
published
GHSA-6cqj-6969-p57x
Nov 21, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/codenotary/immudb/pkg/client
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=1.4.0

## Patched versions

1.4.1

## Description

### Impact

immudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish between different server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep the state for multiple servers. SDK does not validate this uuid and can accept any value reported by the server. A malicious server can change the reported UUID tricking the client to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state completely irrelevant to the one previously retrieved from the server.

### Patches

The following Go SDK versions are not vulnerable

| **SDK** | **Version** |
| --- | --- |
| [go](pkg.go.dev/github.com/codenotary/immudb/pkg/client) | 1.4.1 |

### Workarounds

When initializing an immudb client object, a custom state handler can be used to store the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores the server UUID can be used to ensure that even if the server changes the UUID, client will still consider it to be the same server.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open a discussion in [immudb Discussions](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/discussions/new)
* Email us at immudb-security@codenotary.com

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Release notes

We're pleased to announce new version of immudb: 1.4.1. This is a smaller maintenance release that fixes important issues discovered in the previous 1.4.0 release.

## Important issues fixed

Along with this release, the go SDK for immudb comes with fixes to two security vulnerabilities ([CVE-2022-36111](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-672p-m5jq-mrh8 "CVE-2022-36111") and [CVE-2022-39199](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6cqj-6969-p57x "CVE-2022-39199")) that we've discovered through an internal security review. Those vulnerabilities only affect the client SDK that is part of the immudb release - for that reason make sure that the most recent go SDK version is used in your application.

More information about those vulnerabilities can be found in those adversaries:

* [GHSA-672p-m5jq-mrh8](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/security/advisories/GHSA-672p-m5jq-mrh8 "GHSA-672p-m5jq-mrh8")
* [GHSA-6cqj-6969-p57x](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/security/advisories/GHSA-6cqj-6969-p57x "GHSA-6cqj-6969-p57x")

## Small improvements

Besides important fixes, this release also comes with improved naming convention related to replication options and an option to reset admin password without knowledge of the previous password. Such password reset is helpful in case the admin password is lost and can also be used to ensure there's a correct admin password set in cloud deployments such as Kubernetes.

## Package

gomod

([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.4.1

## Patched versions

1.4.1

## Description

### Impact

In certain scenario a malicious immudb server can provide a falsified proof that will be accepted by the client SDK signing a falsified transaction replacing the genuine one. This situation can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server and requires the client to perform a specific list of verified operations resulting in acceptance of an invalid state value.

This vulnerability only affects immudb client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected by this vulnerability.

### Detailed description

immudb uses Merkle Tree enhanced with additional linear part to perform consistency proofs between two transactions. The linear part is built from the last leaf node of the Merkle Tree compensating for transactions that were not yet consumed by the Merkle Tree calculation.

The Merkle Tree part is then used to perform proofs for things that are in transaction range covered by the Merkle Tree where the linear part is used to check those that are not yet in the Merkle Tree.

When doing consistency checks between two immudb states, the linear proof part is not fully checked. In fact only the first (last Merkle Tree leaf) and the last (current DB state value) are checked against new Merkle Tree without ensuring that elements in the middle of that chain are correctly added as Merkle Tree leafs.

This lack of check means that the database can present different set of hashes on the linear proof part to what would later be used once those become part of the Merkle Tree. This property can be exploited by the database to expose two different transaction entries depending on the other transaction that the user requested consistency proof for.

In practice this could lead to a following scenario:

* a client requests a verified write operation
* the server responds with a proof for the transaction
* client stores the state value retrieved from the server and expects it to be a confirmation of that write and all the history of the database before that transaction
* a series of validated read / write operations is performed by the client, each accompanied by a successfully validated consistency proof and update of the client state
* the client requests verified get operation on the transaction it has written before (and that was verified with a proof from the server)
* the server replies with a completely different transaction that can be properly validated according to the currently stored db state on the client side

### Patches

The following Go SDK versions is not vulnerable:

| **SDK** | **Version** |
| --- | --- |
| [go](pkg.go.dev/github.com/codenotary/immudb/pkg/client) | 1.4.1 |

### Workarounds

Invalid proofs can not be generated in a normal immudb server and will be detected by a genuine replica server.

To ensure that the server does not produce invalid proofs and to check that the history presented by the server

does not contain falsified transactions, one should run a genuine immudb replica server in a safe environment

and fully synchronize all databases with the primary.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
