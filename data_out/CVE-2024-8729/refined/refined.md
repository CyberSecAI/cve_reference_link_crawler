- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute if a user clicks a malicious link, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into clicking a crafted link containing malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click it. No authentication is required.
