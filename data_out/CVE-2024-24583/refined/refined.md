{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `readMSH` function in libigl makes an assumption that the number of entries in the `ElementData` section of a .msh file is synchronized with the number of elements in the `Element` section. This assumption is not enforced, and if there are more elements than expected based on the `ElementData`, it leads to an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `field` vector.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) in `MshLoader::ELEMENT_TRI` when processing triangular elements.",
    "Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) in `MshLoader::ELEMENT_TET` when processing tetrahedral elements."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure by leaking heap data. This leaked data could be used to bypass ASLR or access sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted .msh file with an inconsistent number of elements in the `Element` and `ElementData` sections.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .msh file to the application using the vulnerable `readMSH` function from libigl."
