Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45308:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the case-insensitive nature of string comparisons in MySQL and MariaDB databases when used with HedgeDoc. When the `freeURL` feature is enabled, users can create notes with custom aliases. If a user creates a new note with an alias that matches the lowercased ID of an existing note, the database will return the new note first due to case-insensitive matching. This makes the original note inaccessible.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Case-insensitive database queries:** The core weakness is the use of default case-insensitive comparisons in MySQL and MariaDB queries when looking up notes by alias or short ID.
*   **FreeURL feature abuse:** The `freeURL` feature, which allows users to create notes with arbitrary aliases, provides the attack vector.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can effectively hide existing notes by creating new notes with aliases matching the lowercased IDs of those notes, preventing users from accessing the original content.
*   **Content manipulation:** Attackers can create a manipulated copy of the original note, replacing links or content, and present this to users instead of the original.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network via the HedgeDoc web interface.
*   **FreeURL feature:** The attack exploits the `freeURL` feature, which allows arbitrary alias creation, combined with the database's case-insensitive matching.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Knowledge of existing note IDs:** The attacker needs to know the ID (or the lowercased ID) of the target note they want to hide or replace.
*  **Permissions to create freeURL notes:** Depending on the instance's settings, this could be any user or require a logged-in user status. The vulnerability can be exploited by logged-in users, or, depending on the permission settings, by all users (including non-logged-in).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects HedgeDoc instances using MySQL or MariaDB databases.
*   The provided commit (380587b) fixes the issue by ensuring case-sensitive comparisons using `BINARY` in the database queries when matching aliases or short IDs, specifically targeting the affected queries.
*   Workarounds for this vulnerability include disabling the `freeURL` feature or restricting its usage to trusted users with authentication enabled.
*  The CVSS score is 6.5, categorized as Moderate severity. The CVSS vector string is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L
*   The reported weakness is CWE-1289 (Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity)
