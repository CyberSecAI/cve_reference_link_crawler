# MySQL & free URL mode allows to hide existing notes

Moderate

[davidmehren](/davidmehren)
published
GHSA-pjf2-269h-cx7p
Sep 1, 2024

## Package

hedgedoc

## Affected versions

<=1.9.9

## Patched versions

1.10.0

## Description

### Summary

When using HedgeDoc 1 with MySQL or MariaDB, it is possible to create notes with an alias matching the ID of existing notes.

The affected existing note can then not be accessed anymore and is effectively hidden by the new one.

### Patches

This issue was fixed in [380587b](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/380587b7fd65bc1eb71eef51a3aab324f9877650)

### Details

When the freeURL feature is enabled (by setting the `allowFreeURL` config option or the `CMD_ALLOW_FREEURL` environment variable to `true`), any user with the appropriate permissions can create a note with an arbitrary alias, e.g. by accessing it in the browser.

When MySQL or MariaDB are used, it is possible to create a new note with an alias that matches the lower-cased ID of a different note. HedgeDoc then always presents the new note to users, as these databases perform case-insensitive matching and the lower-cased alias is found first.

### Impact

This issue only affects HedgeDoc instances that use MySQL or MariaDB.

Depending on the permission settings of the HedgeDoc instance, the issue can be exploited only by logged-in users or by all (including non-logged-in) users. The exploit requires knowledge of the ID of the target note.

Attackers could use this issue to present a manipulated copy of the original note to the user, e.g. by replacing the links with malicious ones. Attackers can also use this issue to prevent access to the original note, causing a denial of service. No data is lost, as the original content of the affected notes is still present in the database.

### Workarounds

Disabling freeURL mode prevents the exploitation of this issue.

The impact can be limited by restricting freeURL note creation to trusted, logged-in users by enabling `requireFreeURLAuthentication`/`CMD_REQUIRE_FREEURL_AUTHENTICATION`.

### PoC

1. Create new note without an alias
2. Replace all upper case letters in the URL with lower case letters and visit this new URL
3. A new empty note with an alias will be created
4. The original link now redirects to the lower-case version, the original content is no longer accessible

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
