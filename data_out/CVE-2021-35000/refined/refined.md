- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper memory initialization within the multicast routing implementation in the OpenBSD Kernel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uninitialized memory is accessed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can disclose sensitive information. This can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
