Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Organizer tags" field within the image properties section of the Zenario application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects the user-provided input (the malicious script) back to the user's browser without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Account Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could perform malicious actions on behalf of the victim, like changing settings, posting content, or redirecting to malicious websites.
- **Data Theft**: Could be used to steal information entered on the page

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker manipulates the "Organizer tags" field when editing the properties of an image in the Image library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the Zenario application with administrative privileges in order to access the image library and the ability to edit image properties.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter**: The attacker needs to know that the "Organizer tags" field is vulnerable to XSS.
