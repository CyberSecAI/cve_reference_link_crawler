### @alexmurray **[alexmurray](/alexmurray)** commented [May 25, 2023](#issue-1725813490)

Update snap-seccomp to support explicitly denying certain syscall argument combinations via a new `~` prefix - and use this to block the use of `ioctl` with `TIOCLINUX` - to fix snapd [CVE-2023-1523](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-55wx-23fj-c2v5 "CVE-2023-1523") (similar to flatpak CVE-2023-28100 [GHSA-7qpw-3vjv-xrqp](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7qpw-3vjv-xrqp "GHSA-7qpw-3vjv-xrqp"))

`[snap-seccomp: support explicitly blocking of syscalls](/canonical/snapd/pull/12849/commits/0e879069008948ab15624473c597c72190b6848e "snap-seccomp: support explicitly blocking of syscalls

snap-seccomp has always implemented an allow-list approach to syscalls - such
that the listed syscalls are allowed and any non-listed will get
blocked. However, in the case where we want to disallow a syscall with
particular arguments, it is only possible to block one instance of the sycall
with a given argument. If a second similar rule is added, each rule effectively
allows the other and so neither get disallowed as a result.

So introduce the concept of explicitly denying system calls listed in the
seccomp profile by prefixing them with a tilde (~). The seccomp action for these
is then EACCES (since EPERM is the default for unmatched syscalls and seccomp
doesn't allow to specify an action which is the same as the default).

This then allows to specify to block various syscall argument combinations as
expected, and so is used as the mechanism to fix CVE-2023-1523.

After some playing and poking I think this is okay short term but I think we should replace it ASAP in a followup. The issue is that it seems like libseccomp will "optimize" rules away. As it is designed as an allow-list, the behavior of this:

```
~ioctl - TIOCSTI
~ioctl - TIOCLINUX
ioctl

```

is counter intuitive - it will generate an allow rule for "ioctl" and discard the "~ioctl" entirely:

```
echo -e '~ioctl - TIOCSTI\nioctl\n' > seccomp-profile && SNAP_SECCOMP_DEBUG=1  ./snap-seccomp compile seccomp-profile /tmp/xxx
#
# pseudo filter code start
#
# filter for arch x86_64 (3221225534)
if ($arch == 3221225534)
  # filter for syscall "ioctl" (16) [priority: 65535]
  if ($syscall == 16)
    action ALLOW;
  # default action
  action ERRNO(1);

```

this only works as expected hen combined with another specific rule like:

```
~ioctl - TIOCSTI
~ioctl - TIOCLINUX
ioctl - !TIOCSTI

```

see

```
$ echo -e '~ioctl - TIOCSTI\n~ioctl - TIOCLINUX\nioctl - !TIOCSTI' > seccomp-profile && SNAP_SECCOMP_DEBUG=1  ./snap-seccomp compile seccomp-profile /tmp/xxx
#
# pseudo filter code start
#
# filter for arch x86_64 (3221225534)
if ($arch == 3221225534)
  # filter for syscall "ioctl" (16) [priority: 65532]
  if ($syscall == 16)
    if ($a1.hi32 == 0)
      if ($a1.lo32 == 21532)
        action ERRNO(13);
      if ($a1.lo32 == 21522)
        action ERRNO(13);
      else
        action ALLOW;
    else
      action ALLOW;
  # default action
  action ERRNO(1);

```

I think we probably want instead of "~" a new: `ioctl - !TIOCSTI&&!TIOCLINUX`

Unfortunately there is no way to express this in the libseccomp API <https://libseccomp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/man3/seccomp_rule_add.3/> that I am aware of - we can only do something like 'compare argument 1 is equal to this value' or 'compare argument 1 is greater than this value' - we can't do higher level operations like booleans etc - so I don't think that is possible with libseccomp. If we were to write the BPF filter by hand we could add this but that would be a significant departure from the current implementation.

| So just to clarify - I think we want to tweak this a bit but it's also working correctly and protecting from TIOCLINUX so it's fine to go in but for long term maintainence I think we need something slightly different in the near future. |

When a denylist was introduced in PR#12849 we reached the limits
of the API of libseccomp and some things are now hard to reason
about [1]. This is mostly because of the way libseccomp is working.

So this commit changes the approach and instead of trying to use
a single filter the work is split into two filters:
1. explicit allow list
2. explicit deny list

and then load both filters into the kernel. The way the kernel
works is that it selects the most restrictive action.

So in the case of PR#12849:
```
~ioctl - TIOCSTI
~ioctl - TIOCLINUX
ioctl
```
For `ioctl(TIOCLINUX)` the first allow filter would pass `ioctl`
but the second deny filter would correctly deny the TIOCLINUX.

When a denylist was introduced in PR#12849 we reached the limits
of the API of libseccomp and some things are now hard to reason
about [1]. This is mostly because what we try to do does not
match the libseccomp API very well and a slightly different
approach is probably more aligned with it's design (see also
this libseccomp issue [2] that is related to our issue).

So this commit changes the approach and instead of trying to use
a single filter the work is split into two filters:
1. explicit allow list
2. explicit deny list

and then load both filters into the kernel. The way the kernel
works is that it selects the most restrictive action.

So in the case of PR#12849:
```
~ioctl - TIOCSTI
~ioctl - TIOCLINUX
ioctl
```
For `ioctl(TIOCLINUX)` the first allow filter would pass `ioctl`
but the second deny filter would correctly deny the TIOCLINUX.

The exiting tests for negative filtering got also updated so that
the deny/allow is tested via different errno numbers to ensure that
the expected filter denies the access.

match the libseccomp API very well and a slightly different
approach is probably more aligned with it's design (see also
this libseccomp issue [2] that is related to our issue).

So this commit changes the approach and instead of trying to use
a single filter the work is split into two filters:
1. explicit allow list
2. explicit deny list

and then load both filters into the kernel. The way the kernel
works is that it selects the most restrictive action.

So in the case of PR#12849:
```
~ioctl - TIOCSTI
~ioctl - TIOCLINUX
ioctl
```
For `ioctl(TIOCLINUX)` the first allow filter would pass `ioctl`
but the second deny filter would correctly deny the TIOCLINUX.

The file format of the `snap.snap.app.bin` changes to `.bin2`
and includes a proper header that would allow us to extend more
easily in the future.

The exiting tests for negative filtering got also updated so that
the deny/allow is tested via different errno numbers to ensure that
the expected filter denies the access.

The `snap-seccomp` spread test now also runs on all ubuntu releases.

This work will also allow us to remove the `global.bin` seccomp
filter in a followup PR.

I believe this is the post in question:

Nice, but...

On Linux virtual terminals, it's possible to achieve pretty much the
same effect using TIOCLINUX, the ioctl used by gpm to implement
copy&pasting.

I've attached a minimal PoC. A more elaborate one is here:

# USN-6125-1: snapd vulnerability

31 May 2023

An intended access restriction in snapd could be bypassed by strict mode snaps.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 23.04](/security/notices?release=lunar)
* [Ubuntu 22.10](/security/notices?release=kinetic)
* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)
* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [snapd](/security/cves?package=snapd) - Daemon and tooling that enable snap packages

## Details

It was discovered that the snap sandbox did not restrict the use of the

ioctl system call with a TIOCLINUX request. This could be exploited by a

malicious snap to inject commands into the controlling terminal which would

then be executed outside of the snap sandbox once the snap had exited. This

could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands outside of the

confined snap sandbox. Note: graphical terminal emulators like xterm,

gnome-terminal and others are not affected - this can only be exploited

when snaps are run on a virtual console.
