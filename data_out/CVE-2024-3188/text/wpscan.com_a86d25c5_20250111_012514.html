## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Shortcodes Ultimate < 7.1.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put the following shortcode in a post: [su\_dailymotion url='123"onload="alert(`XSS`)"']
The XSS will be triggered when (pre)viewing the post
