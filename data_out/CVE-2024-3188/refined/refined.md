Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Shortcodes Ultimate plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page or post. Specifically, the `url` attribute of the `su_dailymotion` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability, where malicious scripts are injected through shortcode attributes and stored in the database. These scripts are then executed when a user views the affected post or page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers could use the injected scripts to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, potentially leading to account takeover.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could alter the content and appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript via a crafted shortcode. Specifically the `su_dailymotion` shortcode with a malicious `url` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Contributor Role or Higher:** The attacker must have at least a Contributor role in the WordPress site. This role allows users to create and edit posts but with limited administrative privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to know how to use shortcodes and the vulnerable attributes within the Shortcodes Ultimate plugin.

**Additional details:**

*   The specific shortcode and vulnerable attribute is: `[su_dailymotion url='123"onload="alert(`XSS`)"']`
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.1.0 of the Shortcodes Ultimate plugin.
