- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions in the Intel(R) ITS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Incorrect default permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privilege, allowing an authenticated user to potentially gain higher privileges via local access.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) and has a high attack complexity (AC:H).
