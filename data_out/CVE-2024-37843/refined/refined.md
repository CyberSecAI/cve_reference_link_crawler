- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `orderBy` argument of a GraphQL query in Craft CMS. Specifically, the use of the backtick character (`) allowed injection into the SQL query.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **SQL Injection:** A blind, time-based SQL injection vulnerability is present due to the lack of proper sanitization.
    - **Verbose Error Messages:** The `orderBy` argument returns verbose errors that leak full file paths and the executed SQL query, aiding in exploitation.
    - **Unauthenticated Access:** The GraphQL endpoint did not require authentication for the vulnerable queries.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract data from the database.
    - **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Since the default MySQL user in Craft CMS is `root`, attackers may be able to gain write access to the system and upload webshells, leading to RCE.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - **GraphQL Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is publicly accessible and does not require prior authentication.
    - **`orderBy` Argument:** The injection occurs via manipulation of the `orderBy` argument within a GraphQL query.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Craft CMS instance.
    - **Knowledge of GraphQL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific GraphQL queries that include the injected SQL.
    - **Ability to identify vulnerable argument:** The attacker needs to identify that the `orderBy` parameter is vulnerable.
