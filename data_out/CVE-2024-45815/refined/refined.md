- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted query to the catalog API can cause a prototype pollution vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Prototype pollution (CWE-1321)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A malicious actor with authenticated access to a Backstage instance can interrupt the service using the crafted query, leading to a denial of service (availability impact).
- **Attack vectors**: Network access (remote attack).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have authenticated access to a Backstage instance with the catalog backend plugin installed.
