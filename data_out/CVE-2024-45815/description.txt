Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. A malicious actor with authenticated access to a Backstage instance with the catalog backend plugin installed is able to interrupt the service using a specially crafted query to the catalog API. This has been fixed in the `1.26.0` release of the `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
