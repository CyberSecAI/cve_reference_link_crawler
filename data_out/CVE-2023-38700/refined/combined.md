It is **strongly** reccomended you upgrade your bridge, as this release contains security fixes.

## 🔒 Security

* Fixes for [GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x "GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x").
* Fixes for [GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3 "GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3").
* Fixes for [GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q "GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q")

## Bugfixes

* Improve processing speed of commands sent to and from the proxy when the bridge is configured in pooling mode. ([#1751](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1751))
* Ensure QUIT messages are always sent. ([#1752](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1752))
* Ensure we don't bloat irc supported state. ([#1753](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1753))
* Fix a case where the bridge would not listen for and apply bans for legacy/unspec'd `m.room.rule.*` types in use by Mjolnir. ([#1755](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1755), [#1759](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1759))
* Refactor the command parser for admin and room commands, ensuring we correctly trim the command. ([#1756](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1756))

## Internal Changes

* Update matrix-appservice-bridge to 9.0.1. ([#1760](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1760))

# Events can be crafted to leak parts of targeted messages from other bridged rooms

Low

published
GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q
Aug 4, 2023

## Package

npm

matrix-appservice-irc
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

It was possible to craft an event such that it would leak part of a targeted message event from another bridged room. This required knowing an event ID to target.

### Patches

Please upgrade to 1.0.1.

### Workarounds

You can set the `matrixHandler.eventCacheSize` config value to `0` to workaround this bug. However, this may impact performance.

### Credits

Discovered and reported by [Val Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
