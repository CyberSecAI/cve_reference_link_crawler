- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Location Picker at Checkout for WooCommerce plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis, but it could potentially lead to unauthorized actions by lower-privileged users.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is in the plugin itself, and exploitation would likely occur through the WordPress interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber, a user role with lower privileges than administrators.
