- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation of the "price" and "sname" parameters in the `/edit-services-details.php` page of the Client Management System.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victimâ€™s browser, potentially leading to data theft or unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1. Navigate to the `/manage-services.php` page.
    2. Click the "Edit" button for a service.
    3. Inject a malicious XSS payload (e.g., `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) into the "price" or "sname" parameters.
    4. Save the changes by clicking the "Update" button.
    5. Accessing the edit page for the same service will trigger the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `/manage-services.php` page with the ability to edit service details.
