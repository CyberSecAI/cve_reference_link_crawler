### This SIS is a game changer for sure

After years of frustration with pricey and inadequate systems, we finally took a leap of faith for this new SaaS offering from our on-prem open-source version. This system is incredible in its architecture, security, and scalability. Â Less headache for us.

## Qwanisha Branch

Principal, Lawrence Day School, Arizona
### OMG! What a beautiful software!

Finally, software built for us, the Teachers. So beautiful and simple to use. I call it the "zero training" SIS. Our Teachers love it and are using it for real. This is a great achievement so far.

### ERP our way

Our schools needed an education management system that could connect to our many regional application providers. openSIS provided the flexibility to integrate with our cloud and on-premises software. We gained from a Â modern SIS as well kept our legacy apps.
