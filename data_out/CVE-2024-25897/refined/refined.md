The provided content is related to CVE-2024-25897.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the failure of the backend to effectively validate user input specifically the `CurrentFundraiser` GET parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in the following files:
- `/Reports/FRCertificates.php`
- `/Reports/FRBidSheets.php`
- `/Reports/FRCatalog.php`

These vulnerabilities occur due to the lack of proper input validation, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected via the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
- Spoofing identity
- Tampering with existing data
- Repudiation issues (e.g., voiding transactions, changing balances)
- Complete disclosure of all data on the system
- Data destruction or unavailability
- Potential for becoming administrators of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts, specifically by manipulating the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application. No special privileges or internal network access is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code using the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter in the URL.
- The application fails to sanitize this parameter, leading to direct execution of the injected code against the database.
- The provided proof of concept includes boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection payloads.
