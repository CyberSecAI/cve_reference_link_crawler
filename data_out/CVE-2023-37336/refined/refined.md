- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of TIF files, which leads to a write past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves user interaction, requiring the target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious TIF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious TIF file to the victim or trick the victim into visiting a malicious page hosting the malicious TIF file.
