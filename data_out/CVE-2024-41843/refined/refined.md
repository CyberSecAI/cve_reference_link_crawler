- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, categorized as CWE-79.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, where a malicious script is injected into the application. When a user interacts with the stored malicious content, the script executes in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application, which might be through a feature that allows user-submitted data. The attacker also needs a victim to interact with the stored malicious script via their web browser.
