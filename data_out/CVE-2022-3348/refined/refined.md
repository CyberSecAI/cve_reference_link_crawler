Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability fix:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit message "fix: hide user data from thread module" suggests that the vulnerability stemmed from the exposure of user data within the thread module. Specifically, the code was likely returning more user information than necessary when fetching threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Data Exposure:** The original code, as evidenced by the diff in `server/src/services/thread.service.ts`, was retrieving more user data than required. The `ManyToOne` relationship in `server/src/entities/thread.entity.ts` was using `eager: true`, which was likely causing the full user object to be fetched and returned when retrieving threads.
*   **Unnecessary Data Transfer:** The eager loading caused unnecessary data transfer of user information, potentially including sensitive data that should not be exposed in the context of threads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive user information that they were not authorized to view via the thread module.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Exposure of user data can lead to privacy violations, especially if the data included Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Request:** An attacker could make a standard API request to fetch threads. If the thread API returned complete user objects, this would expose the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker would likely need to be an authenticated user within the application to make requests to the thread API.
*   **API Access:** The attacker would need access to the application's API endpoint that serves thread data.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Code Changes:**
    *   `server/src/entities/thread.entity.ts`: The `eager: true` option was removed from the `ManyToOne` relationship with the `User` entity. This prevents the automatic loading of user data.
    *   `server/src/services/thread.service.ts`: The query builder was modified to specifically select only the required user fields ('user.id', 'user.firstName', 'user.lastName').

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by:
    *   Disabling eager loading of user data and using a query builder that only selects the necessary user fields when fetching thread data.
    *   This ensures that only the required user data (ID, first name, last name) is returned with thread information.

This analysis suggests that the commit addresses a vulnerability related to excessive data exposure within the thread module of ToolJet. While the provided content lacks a specific CVE ID, the code changes and commit message provide a good indication of the issue and how it was resolved.

**It is important to note that while this analysis is based on the provided information and common security best practices, a definitive vulnerability classification requires full access to the application code and its context.**

**NOINFO** - While the analysis highlights a potential vulnerability, it does not directly align with the CVE format. It describes a fix for data exposure rather than a confirmed CVE. Therefore, the response is "NOINFO"
