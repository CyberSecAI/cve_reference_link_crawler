Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The core issue lies in the lack of a state machine within the Agent15 TLS engine used by the Kwik QUIC implementation. This means the TLS engine doesn't track the connection's current state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing State Tracking:** The absence of state tracking allows overwriting of previously computed cryptographic parameters.
*   **Replay Vulnerability:**  Resending a Client Hello or Finished TLS message overwrites existing connection parameters at any connection state, even after the connection is established.
*   **Unused Key Processing:** The server processes Initial packets even after the handshake, leading to overwriting of connection parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overwriting connection parameters, an attacker can desynchronize a legitimate client-server connection, preventing further communication.
*   **Connection Hijacking:** After desynchronizing the victim, an attacker can complete the overwritten connection with a crafted Finished TLS message, effectively hijacking the connection.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Sniffing:** The attacker needs to monitor network traffic to capture the initial QUIC packets of a victim.
*   **Initial Packet Injection:** The attacker crafts and sends an Initial packet containing a malicious Client Hello message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be able to sniff network traffic between the client and server.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting valid QUIC and TLS packets, specifically Initial packets with modified Client Hello messages.
*   **Key Derivation:** The attacker must be able to compute the Initial encryption key as defined in RFC9001.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both Kwik (QUIC implementation) and Agent15 (TLS engine).
*   The attack is described as a remote attack.
*   The issue is linked with CVE-2024-22588, where an attacker can use the unused initial key to send an Initial packet with a malicious Client Hello message.
*   The provided information includes the commit hashes where the vulnerability was found and fixed for both Kwik and Agent15.
*   The exploitation steps are clearly outlined in the provided text.
