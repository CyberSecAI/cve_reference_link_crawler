- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formWifiBasicSet` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `security_5g` parameter, received from a POST request, is copied to a fixed-size buffer of 256 bytes (`v34`) using `strcpy`.  Since the length of `security_5g` is not validated, an attacker can provide a string longer than 256 bytes, causing a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint with a `security_5g` parameter that exceeds 256 bytes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
