In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: resolve memory leak from exfat_create_upcase_table()

If exfat_load_upcase_table reaches end and returns -EINVAL,
allocated memory doesn't get freed and while
exfat_load_default_upcase_table allocates more memory, leading to a
memory leak.
