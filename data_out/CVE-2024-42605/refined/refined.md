The provided content relates to CVE-2024-42605.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in Pligg CMS V2.0.2. Specifically, the `edit_page.php` endpoint does not properly validate the origin of the requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can induce an authenticated user into submitting a crafted request, leading to unintended changes to the page content. In this PoC, the attacker can modify page content using the form provided via CSRF. This could enable defacement of the site or injection of malicious content into the webpage.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that targets the vulnerable endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/edit_page.php?link_id=1`.
- This page is served to a user who is logged into the Pligg CMS instance.
- When the victim visits this page, the attacker-controlled form will make a request to the CMS with the victim's credentials, thus performing unintended changes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in user into visiting a malicious webpage controlled by the attacker. The attacker does not need any prior access to the CMS.
- The attacker also needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint, `edit_page.php`, and its parameters.
