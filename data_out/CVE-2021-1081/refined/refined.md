Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-1081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA vGPU software, specifically in the guest kernel mode driver and Virtual GPU manager (vGPU plugin).
*   The root cause is a lack of proper input length validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insufficient input validation is the primary weakness. The software does not check the length of input data before processing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Exploitation can lead to:
    *   Information Disclosure: Attackers might gain access to sensitive information.
    *   Data Tampering: Attackers could potentially modify data.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): The system or service may become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local, unprivileged access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   User interaction is not required (UI:N).

**Summary**

The vulnerability is due to a missing input length validation in the NVIDIA vGPU software's guest kernel mode driver and Virtual GPU manager (vGPU plugin). This can allow an attacker with local access to cause information disclosure, data tampering, or denial of service.

**CVSS Vector:** AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
