The provided content is related to a fix for a harmless warning in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem, specifically within the nf_tables module. This is not a security vulnerability and thus does not relate to a CVE.

Specifically, the issue was that on network namespace (netns) removal, the netdev event UNREGISTER was being generated after the base hook had already been removed, which caused a harmless warning. The fix is to skip these netdev events generated on netns removal because the core nf_tables subsystem now handles the unregistration during the .pre_exit hook.

The relevant commit messages are:
- "netfilter: nf_tables: skip netdev events generated on netns removal" (commit 68a3765c659f809dcaac20030853a054646eb739)
- "netfilter: nf_tables: skip netdev events generated on netns removal" (commit 90c7c58aa2bd02c65a4c63b7dfe0b16eab12cf9f)

Both commits address the same issue and contain the same code changes.

Root cause of the issue:
- The netdev event UNREGISTER was triggered on netns removal after the nf_tables core had already unregistered the base hook causing a harmless warning

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- None. This was a race condition leading to a harmless warning, not a security vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
- There is no impact because this was not a security issue.

Attack vectors:
- Not applicable. No exploitation.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Not applicable. No exploitation.

Additional details:
- The fix involves checking if the network namespace is still valid before processing the netdev event and skipping the event if the netns is no longer valid.
- The issue was reported by syzbot, a kernel fuzzer.
- The fix was backported to multiple stable kernel branches.
