Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `${}` in the `mybatis-mappers/DeptMapper.xml` file to directly embed user-controlled input into SQL queries, specifically within the `params.dataScope` parameter. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw caused by using `${}` for string interpolation in MyBatis, instead of parameterized queries which would properly sanitize user inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could use this SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Depending on the database permissions, an attacker might be able to modify or delete database records.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, successful SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the application or underlying system.
*   **Potential for complete system compromise**: If the application is running with high permissions an attacker could leverage the SQL injection for a complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the `params["dataScope"]` parameter in an HTTP request to inject malicious SQL code.
*   Specifically, the endpoint `/api/dept/build` is vulnerable through the `params[dataScope]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
*   **Understanding of the application's database:** To achieve successful exploitation, the attacker requires knowledge of the underlying database structure.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found by Chaitin Security Research Lab
*   The vulnerable parameter is `dataScope`, accessible through the `params` map in the `DeptDto` object, within the `BaseEntity` class.
*   The exploit can be confirmed with the SQLMap tool.
*   The provided SQLMap command-line parameters demonstrate a time-based blind SQL injection.

In summary, the provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `my-springsecurity-plus` project due to the unsafe use of string interpolation for constructing SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability by manipulating HTTP request parameters to perform arbitrary database queries, potentially leading to data breaches and more.
