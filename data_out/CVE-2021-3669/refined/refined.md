{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's method of measuring shared memory usage does not scale efficiently with a large number of shared memory segments.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource exhaustion",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service by creating a large number of shared memory segments.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the kernel's inability to efficiently handle large numbers of shared memory segments.",
        "Reading the /proc/sysvipc/shm file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create shared memory segments. This usually requires local access to the system, or the ability to run code on the system. The attacker needs to create a large number of shared memory segments, which may exceed the normal ulimits."
