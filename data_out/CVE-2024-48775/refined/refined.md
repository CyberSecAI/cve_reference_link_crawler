Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper access controls on the vendor's firmware server. The server allows direct access to firmware update files without any form of authentication or authorization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The firmware server does not restrict access to firmware files.
- **Firmware leakage:** The vulnerability results in the exposure of firmware files to unauthorized individuals.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized firmware download:** Attackers can download the latest firmware before it is officially released.
- **Firmware analysis:** Attackers can analyze the firmware for vulnerabilities or proprietary information.
- **Creation of malicious firmware:** Attackers can create modified firmware images with malicious code.
- **Malicious firmware distribution:** Attackers can distribute compromised firmware updates to unsuspecting users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending direct HTTP GET requests to the firmware server using publicly available URLs extracted from the mobile app.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to perform static reverse engineering of the mobile app to extract the necessary URLs.
- The attacker also needs to be capable of making HTTP requests.
- No authentication or special authorization is required, and the attacker does not require a privileged position on the network.
