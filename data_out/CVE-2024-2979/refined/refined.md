Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setSchedWifi` function of the Tenda F1203 V2.0.1.6 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `schedEndTime` parameter, received from a POST request, is copied into a fixed-size buffer (`ptr`) using `strcpy`.
- The size of the destination buffer is 25 bytes, while the length of the input `schedEndTime` is not validated, leading to a buffer overflow when a string longer than 15 bytes (25 - 10) is provided.
- Specifically the line `strcpy((char *)ptr + 10, v6);` copies user-controlled input into an offset of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The buffer overflow can lead to a crash, potential denial of service (DoS), and potentially remote code execution (RCE).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint.
- The `schedEndTime` parameter in the POST request is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker could be on the same network as the router or have remote access.
- No authentication required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a Python script and the `requests` library.
- The PoC sends a POST request with an oversized `schedEndTime` parameter to overflow the buffer.
- The vulnerability affects Tenda F1203 V2.0.1.6 firmware.
