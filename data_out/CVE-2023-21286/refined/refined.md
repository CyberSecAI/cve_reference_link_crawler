Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of URI checks in nested views when using ViewGroupActionAdd in RemoteViews, potentially allowing notifications to display resources belonging to other users.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of URIs within nested views when processing RemoteViews actions, specifically when using ViewGroupActionAdd. This allows for the possibility of accessing resources that should be restricted to other users.

Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized information disclosure, where a malicious application can display resources from other users within a notification. This might include sensitive information depending on the resources exposed.

Attack vectors: The attack vector involves crafting malicious notifications that include nested views with crafted URIs via `ViewGroupActionAdd`. These notifications would then be displayed on the target device, leading to the potential disclosure of resources.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need the ability to send notifications to the target device. This could be accomplished by having a malicious app installed on the device, or exploiting other means of sending a malicious notification. No user interaction is explicitly required for the exploit once a notification is displayed.
