Subject: CVE-2024-30251: DoS in aiohttp

Aiohttp is an HTTP client and server-side web framework in Python. This issue only affects
users of the server-side web framework. We've not seen any evidence of this being
exploited in the wild yet, and fixes were already included in the 3.9.4 and 3.9.5
releases.

<https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-5m98-qgg9-wh84>

### Summary
An attacker can send a specially crafted POST (multipart/form-data) request. When the
aiohttp server processes it, the server will enter an infinite loop and be unable to
process any further requests.

### Impact
An attacker can stop the application from serving requests after sending a single request.

-------

For anyone needing to patch older versions of aiohttp, the minimum diff needed to resolve
the issue is (located in `_read_chunk_from_length()`):

   diff --git a/aiohttp/multipart.py b/aiohttp/multipart.py
   index 227be605c..71fc2654a 100644
   --- a/aiohttp/multipart.py

This does however introduce some very minor issues with handling form data. So, if
possible, it would be recommended to also backport the changes in:
