# DoS when trying to parse malformed POST requests

High

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-5m98-qgg9-wh84
May 2, 2024

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.9.4

## Patched versions

3.9.4

## Description

### Summary

An attacker can send a specially crafted POST (multipart/form-data) request. When the aiohttp server processes it, the server will enter an infinite loop and be unable to process any further requests.

### Impact

An attacker can stop the application from serving requests after sending a single request.

---

For anyone needing to patch older versions of aiohttp, the minimum diff needed to resolve the issue is (located in `_read_chunk_from_length()`):

```
diff --git a/aiohttp/multipart.py b/aiohttp/multipart.py
index 227be605c..71fc2654a 100644
--- a/aiohttp/multipart.py
+++ b/aiohttp/multipart.py
@@ -338,6 +338,8 @@ class BodyPartReader:
         assert self._length is not None, "Content-Length required for chunked read"
         chunk_size = min(size, self._length - self._read_bytes)
         chunk = await self._content.read(chunk_size)
+        if self._content.at_eof():
+            self._at_eof = True
         return chunk

     async def _read_chunk_from_stream(self, size: int) -> bytes:
```

This does however introduce some very minor issues with handling form data. So, if possible, it would be recommended to also backport the changes in:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
