{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the 'id' parameter in the deleteProduct.php file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access and extraction of sensitive information from the database. This could include reading, modifying, or deleting data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'id' parameter in the deleteProduct.php file via a crafted HTTP request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.  They need to be able to intercept and modify the request. The attacker must also have access to an account with the ability to delete product entries which is likely an admin account."
