- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The lack of HSTS allows a remote attacker to potentially intercept and obtain sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the CP4S server.
