Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-20089

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `parseString` and `merge` functions within the `purl.js` library. These functions are used to parse URL query parameters and fragment identifiers. The `merge` function recursively sets values on the object without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the prototype of an object through crafted input. Specifically, the code doesn't prevent overwriting properties on the `__proto__` and `constructor` objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prototype pollution: The `merge` function can modify the prototype of the base object due to the lack of proper validation of the input keys. This occurs when the provided key contains `__proto__` or `constructor`
- Lack of sanitization:  The code does not sanitize or validate the keys extracted from the URL query parameters and fragment identifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Prototype pollution can lead to a variety of issues, including:
    - Denial of Service (DoS): By modifying properties on the prototype chain, an attacker could potentially cause unexpected behavior or crashes in the application using the library.
    - Arbitrary Code Execution: In specific cases, prototype pollution can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code by manipulating properties of the base Javascript objects.
    - Data corruption: By manipulating object properties an attacker might also be able to corrupt the data used by the application
- The provided PoC demonstrates that an attacker can modify `__proto__` and `constructor` properties of the base object, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URL query parameters: An attacker can craft a URL with malicious query parameters that contain `__proto__` or `constructor` keys, such as `?__proto__[test1]=test1`.
- Crafted URL fragment identifiers: An attacker can craft a URL with malicious fragment identifiers that contain `__proto__` or `constructor` keys, such as `#constructor[prototype][test]=test`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the URL that is processed by the vulnerable `purl.js` library. This might include manipulating links, redirects, or any other mechanism that involves processing a URL.
- The attacker needs no user interaction once the URL is loaded and processed by the victim application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC shows how to exploit this vulnerability using crafted query parameters and fragment identifiers.
- The vulnerability exists in versions of `purl.js` prior to the fix.
- The affected lines of code are located within the `parseString` function and in the `merge` function.
- The content provides a good detailed explanation of the vulnerability, the PoC and the vulnerable code section, which is more detailed than the basic CVE description which contains a placeholder.
