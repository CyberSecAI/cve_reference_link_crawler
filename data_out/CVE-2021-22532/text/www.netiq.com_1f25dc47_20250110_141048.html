## 1.0 Whatâs New?

eDirectory 9.2 SP5 provides the following fixes in this release:

### 1.1 Updates for the eDirectory Docker Containers

We are shipping a preview version of Docker Container-based deployment with eDirectory 9.2 SP5 for customers to use and provide feedback. Customers wishing to deploy in production will be supported only with a Professional Services engagement. For more information, see [Deploying eDirectory Using Docker Container](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_install/data/t49vfpqotaz8.html) in the [eDirectory Installation Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_install/).

### 1.2 New edirAdmin User Group Created While Installing eDirectory on Linux

From eDirectory 9.2.5 release and onward, the installer creates a new user group called edirAdmin during installation. This user group has access permission to the directories where the data, log, and configuration files are installed. Any user added to this group will have the group permissions assigned to these directories. However, for non-root installation or configuration, this group must be manually created before installing or upgrading eDirectory on the server. After creating the user group, the user must be added to this group to be able to configure eDirectory server instances using his or her individual tarball installation, or by using a binary installation. For more information, see [Adding the edirAdmin User Group](/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_install/data/t4g6f1uekq6m.html) in the [eDirectory Installation Guide](/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_install/data/bookinfo.html).

### 1.3 Operating System Support

In addition to the operating systems supported in previous versions of eDirectory, this release adds support for the following:

* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 15 SP3
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.4

### 1.4 Fixed Issues

eDirectory 9.2 SP5 includes the following software fixes that resolve several previous issues:

#### Resolved Security Vulnerability

This version of eDirectory resolves CVE-2021-22532 and CVE-2021-22533.

#### Discrepancy When Using Microsoft Server 2008 Password Policy Where the Actual Password Violations Exceed the Number of Complexity Violations Set in eDirectory

*Fix:*
This issue was occurring because eDirectory categorized alphabets with diacritical marks as extended ASCII characters. From this release, eDirectory will not consider them as extended characters. (Defect 235445)

#### High-Valued Attributes Adversely Affecting eDirectory Services Performance

*Fix:*
When any of the two high-valued attributes namely, DirXMLEntitlementResult and oidpInstanceData exceed a certain threshold value, eDirectory now triggers a new DSE\_HIGH\_VALUED\_ATTR(341)event to alert the user. This event is logged into the hvAttr-alert.log file. (Defect 257205)

#### Broken Links While Searching for Errors in iMonitor

*Fix:*
The links are working correctly.(Defect 235439)

#### Connection Between eDirectory and Identity Applications Terminates with an Error Code -5875 in ndstrace

*Fix:*
This occurs due to asynchronous requests from the client over SSL connection. This version of eDirectory implements a synchronization mechanism that prevents simultaneous access to SSL connection. (Defect 322019)

#### Using the NOT Operator "!" in Search Query Does Not Return Correct Results When Searching Nested Groups with NDSD\_USE\_GROUPMEMBERSHIP\_OPTIMIZATION=true

*Fix:*
Searching nested groups using the NOT operator "!" in the search query now displays the result as expected, irrespective of the value set for the NDSD\_USE\_GROUPMEMBERSHIP\_OPTIMIZATION flag. (Defect 329530)

#### Path for the env\_custom Environment File in SystemD Service File Set Incorrectly After Upgrading eDirectory to 9.2.x Version

*Fix:*
In eDirectory 9.2.5 version, the path for the env\_custom evironment file is set properly in the service file created for the nds.conf file. (Defect 314445)
