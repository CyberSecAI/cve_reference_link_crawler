```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mergeDeep` function in the `@abip/sp-common` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `mergeDeep` function does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` via the `__proto__` property.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Prototype pollution can lead to Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, or Cross-Site Scripting attacks, depending on the specific application logic and how the polluted prototype is used.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can call the vulnerable `mergeDeep` function with a crafted object containing the `__proto__` property.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to pass arguments to the vulnerable `mergeDeep` function. The specific capabilities depend on how the function is exposed within the application."
