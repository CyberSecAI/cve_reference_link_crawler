  "CVE-2023-46892": {
    "Description": "The radio frequency communication protocol being used by Meross MSH30Q 4.5.23 is vulnerable to replay attacks, allowing attackers to record and replay previously captured communication to execute unauthorized commands or actions (e.g., thermostat's temperature).",
    "Root cause": "The radio frequency communication protocol lacks replay protection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Vulnerable to replay attacks"
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers can record and replay previously captured communication to execute unauthorized commands or actions such as changing the thermostat's temperature.",
    "Attack vectors": "Radio frequency communication",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to capture the radio frequency communication between the device and its controller."
