{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The OpenShift Deployer Plugin does not perform sufficient permission checks in its form validation methods.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing permission check",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system and upload a SSH key file from the Jenkins controller file system to an attacker-specified URL.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting malicious HTTP requests, attackers can exploit missing permission checks to perform unauthorized file system checks and SSH key uploads.",
        "CSRF attacks, due to the lack of POST request requirements, can be used to trigger these actions by a victim's browser"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs Overall/Read permissions to exploit the vulnerability."
