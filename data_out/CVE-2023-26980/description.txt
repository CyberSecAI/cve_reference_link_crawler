PAX Technology PAX A920 Pro PayDroid 8.1suffers from a Race Condition vulnerability, which allows attackers to bypass the payment software and force the OS to boot directly to Android during the boot process. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the attack is not feasible: the home launcher will be loaded before any user applications.
