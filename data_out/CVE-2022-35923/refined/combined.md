# Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity

High

[imbrn](/imbrn)
published
GHSA-xrx9-gj26-5wx9
Jul 26, 2022

## Package

npm

v8n
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.5.1

## Patched versions

1.5.1

## Description

### Impact

Inefficient regular expression complexity of `lowercase()` and `uppercase()` regex could lead to a denial of service attack. With a formed payload `'a' + 'a'.repeat(i) + 'A'`, only 32 characters payload could take 29443 ms time execution when testing `lowercase()`. The same issue happens with `uppercase()`.

### Patches

v1.5.1

### References
