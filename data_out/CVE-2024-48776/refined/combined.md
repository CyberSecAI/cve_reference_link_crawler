[#### Smart Electric Car Charger

Mark Boyle 🇬🇧

I automated my EV charger using a Shelly 1 to control charging times based on my night-time tariff, optimizing energy use for my Nissan Leaf.

[#### Heater Smart Switch

by Gerhard Müller 🇩🇪

To automate my home heating system, I installed a Shelly 1PM Mini Gen3 switch to control the gas boiler based on sensor data, reducing standby energy consumption.

[#### Project Luma: Home Cinema

Luca Scaringella 🇩🇪

Luma is a fully automated home cinema that I built with my father, combining his construction skills with my technical expertise in software engineering, using Shelly components, a custom server, and app.

[#### RV Trailer As A Shelly Smart Home

Christian Hunziker 🇩🇪

It all started with the desire to monitor the temperature in the refrigerator while traveling and the first Shelly H&T. In the meantime, almost 30 Shelly products are in use and have turned it into a real "smart home on wheels".

[#### Door Closed and Locked Monitoring with Shelly BLU Door Window

Beat Frei 🇩🇪

By adding a limit switch to the Shelly Blu Door/Window sensor, I enabled it to detect both closed and locked status. Now, you can check the door's security anytime via the Shelly app, ensuring peace of mind.

[#### Using Photovoltaic Energy for Water Heating

Bence Harvan 🇭🇺

With Shelly devices, you can efficiently use excess photovoltaic energy to heat water in your home. The system directs surplus energy to the water heater, reducing grid dependence. This setup helps lower energy costs and promotes sustainability.

[#### Smart Automation For A Windmill Villa With Pool

Nuno Vicente 🇵🇹

With Shelly I control pool systems, lights, and monitor water levels remotely for my holiday home. Sensors help manage temperature, humidity, and even notify me when the rat trap is triggered.

# Vulnerability Report - com.home.shelly- Incorrect Access Control

**Product:** `com.home.shelly`

**Vendor:** [Shelly](https://www.shelly.com/)

**Version:** 1.0.4

**Vulnerability Type:** Incorrect Access Control

**Severity:** High

## Description

The `com.home.shelly` , developed by Shelly, suffers from an Incorrect Access Control vulnerability during the device firmware update process. The app uses HTTPS requests to download firmware updates. By reverse engineering the app, it was possible to identify the firmware download mechanism and the download link. Dynamic testing revealed that the vendor's firmware server lacks proper access control, leading to **firmware leakage**.

> Although the vendor has discontinued the use of the application, the URL for obtaining firmware has not been deprecated.

## Reproduction Steps

1. The `checkFirmware(JSONObject)` method in the `BackgroundFCMHandler` class provides the necessary URL and other information required for the HTTP request. Static reverse engineering allows for the reconstruction of the complete request as follows:

   [![image-20241002220234191](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1ec210d3caa62fb47f7ff6fef86bdf8726edf5c86b7f672c5886413e875889f5/68747470733a2f2f73322e6c6f6c692e6e65742f323032342f31302f30322f4d673375315336344963435739376d2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1ec210d3caa62fb47f7ff6fef86bdf8726edf5c86b7f672c5886413e875889f5/68747470733a2f2f73322e6c6f6c692e6e65742f323032342f31302f30322f4d673375315336344963435739376d2e706e67)
2. Sending this URL request to the firmware server results in a direct response containing the latest firmware information as follows:

   > Request

   ```
   GET https://api.shelly.cloud/files/firmware HTTP/1.1
   Host: api.shelly.cloud
   Content-Type: text/plain
   ```
   > Response:

   ......
   ```
3. Consequently, the unprotected firmware can be directly downloaded using this information.
