Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-44977**.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation on the size of the Trusted Application (TA) binary loaded through the debugfs interface in the AMD GPU driver. Specifically, the code did not check if the provided TA binary size `ta_bin_len` exceeded a predefined maximum `PSP_1_MEG` before allocating memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** Without proper size validation, a user could provide a `ta_bin_len` larger than the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write when copying the TA binary data, `copy_pos += sizeof(uint32_t)`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:**  Out-of-bounds writes can corrupt kernel memory, leading to system instability, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access via debugfs:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user who has write access to the debugfs interface of the AMD GPU driver (`ta_if_load_debugfs_write`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system and must have the ability to write to the debugfs file associated with the AMD GPU driver.
- Knowledge of the debugfs interface of the AMD GPU driver is required.

**Mitigation:**
- The provided patches add a size validation check. Before allocating memory for the TA binary, the code now verifies that `ta_bin_len` is not larger than `PSP_1_MEG`. If it is, the function returns an error, preventing the out-of-bounds write.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_psp_ta.c` file.
- The provided information contains the fix for the vulnerability, validating the size of the TA binary.
- The fix is included in multiple commits, indicating it was backported to stable kernel branches.
