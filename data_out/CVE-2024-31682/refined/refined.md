- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's fingerprint authentication mechanism has several flaws: insecure cryptographic parameter configuration, use of a deprecated API, failure to disable fingerprint auth on new fingerprint registration, and lack of user verification when disabling the fingerprint feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure cryptographic parameter configuration in fingerprint authentication, allowing bypass.
    - Usage of deprecated FingerprintManager API, susceptible to UI attacks.
    - Failure to disable fingerprint authentication when a new fingerprint is added, allowing access with new fingerprint.
    - Lack of user verification when disabling fingerprint, compromising fingerprint protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass fingerprint authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application, and also disable fingerprint protection completely without authentication.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Using Frida to hook and spoof the fingerprint authentication function.
    - Adding a new fingerprint on the device.
    - Directly disabling the fingerprint functionality of the app
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run Frida on the target device, which suggests physical or remote access to the device, and the ability to add a fingerprint to the target device.
