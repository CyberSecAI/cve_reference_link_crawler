{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `ffs_data_clear` function in the Linux kernel's USB gadget filesystem (f_fs) driver was being called multiple times during the teardown of a function, leading to a double free of the eventfd context when userland provides an eventfd.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Multiple calls to `ffs_data_clear` during unmount and ep0 close operations.",
      "Failure to clear the `ffs_eventfd` pointer after releasing the eventfd context.",
      "Refcount underflow due to repeated calls to eventfd_ctx_put."
    ],
    "impact": "A refcount underflow leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in the kernel, causing a system crash or unexpected behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious or faulty userland application using the f_fs gadget function.",
       "Closing the ep0 and then unmounting f_fs, causing `ffs_data_clear` to be called more than once."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to control the userland application which interacts with f_fs and needs to be able to trigger the specific sequence of closing ep0 and unmounting f_fs.",
     "additional_info": "The `ffs_data_clear` function is indirectly called from both `ffs_fs_kill_sb` and `ffs_ep0_release`, resulting in multiple calls during teardown. The fix involves NULL-ifying `ffs_eventfd` to prevent extraneous `eventfd_ctx_put` calls. Also, setting `epfiles` to `NULL` after deallocation was done for readability. A trace example shows the sequence and call stack that triggers the vulnerability."
