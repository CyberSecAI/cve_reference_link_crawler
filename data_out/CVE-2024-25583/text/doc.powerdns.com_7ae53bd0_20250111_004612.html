# PowerDNS Security Advisory 2024-02: if recursive forwarding is configured, crafted responses can lead to a denial of service in Recursor[Â¶](#powerdns-security-advisory-2024-02-if-recursive-forwarding-is-configured-crafted-responses-can-lead-to-a-denial-of-service-in-recursor "Permalink to this headline")

* CVE: CVE-2024-25583
* Date: 24th of April 2024.
* Affects: PowerDNS Recursor 4.8.7, 4.9.4 and 5.0.3; earlier versions are not affected
* Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor 4.8.8, 4.9.5 and 5.0.4
* Severity: High (only when using recursive forwarding)
* Impact: Denial of service
* Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker publishing a crafted zone
* Risk of system compromise: None
* Solution: Upgrade to patched version

A crafted response from an upstream server the recursor has been configured to forward-recurse to can cause a Denial of
Service in the Recursor. The default configuration of the Recursor does not use recursive forwarding
and is not affected.

CVSS Score: 7.5, only for configurations using recursive forwarding, see
<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1>

The remedy is to update to a patched version.
