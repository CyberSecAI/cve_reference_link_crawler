- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user on the host system.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker needs the ability to execute high-privileged code on the guest system. The attacker can then trigger the overflow by providing user-supplied data of a size greater than the fixed-length buffer within the Toolgate component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must first gain high-privileged code execution on the guest system, and then exploit the Toolgate component to escalate privileges on the host system.
