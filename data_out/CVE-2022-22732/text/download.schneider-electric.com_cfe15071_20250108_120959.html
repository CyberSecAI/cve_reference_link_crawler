Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when upgrading their systems. We
strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of this upgrade in a Test
and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric’s
Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing the software installation.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Configure firewall to restrict network access to authorized IP addresses as applicable.
•  Use low privileged user account for running EPC. Do not run EPC with administrator

privilege.

•  Keep Operating System and Chrome browser up to date.
•  Recommend not to use any web browser while using EPC.
•  Do not open unknown or malicious websites in browser while using EPC.
•  Do not click on unknown links or open attachments from unknown source.
•  Train the users - Provide cybersecurity training to all your employees to help keep your
organization secure. Explain phishing emails, infected attachments, malicious websites,
and other methods that attack them directly.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
