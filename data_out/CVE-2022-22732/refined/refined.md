- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Exposure of resource to wrong sphere. The vulnerability exists because all remote domains can access resources (data) supplied by the server when an attacker sends a fetch request from a third-party or malicious site.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access data supplied by the server. This could lead to loss of data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a fetch request from a third-party or malicious site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a fetch request from a third-party or malicious site. The attacker requires low privileges and a user interaction (UI) component for successful exploitation.
