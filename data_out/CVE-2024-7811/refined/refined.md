Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `delete-expense.php` file of the "Daily Expenses Monitoring App" version 1.0.
*   The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (the `expense` parameter from the GET request) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization/parameterization when constructing the SQL query. The `$expense` variable is directly inserted into the SQL query string.
    ```php
    $query = "DELETE FROM tbl_expense WHERE tbl_expense_id = '$expense'";
    ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete arbitrary data in the `tbl_expense` table.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user credentials, financial data, or other confidential information.
*   **Database Compromise:** In some cases, a successful SQL injection could even lead to full database compromise, allowing the attacker to gain control of the database server and potentially the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `delete-expense.php` endpoint.
*   **`expense` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the `expense` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL queries.
*   **Knowledge of Application Structure:** The attacker needs to know the application's endpoint (`delete-expense.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`expense`).

**Technical Details:**
* The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using `GTID_SUBSET` function, where the response time will vary depending on the success of the query, allowing the attacker to infer information from the database.

   ```
*   The code snippet from `delete-expense.php` confirms that the `$expense` value is used directly in the SQL query, without any sanitization:
    ```php
    if (isset($_GET['expense'])) {
        $expense = $_GET['expense'];
        $query = "DELETE FROM tbl_expense WHERE tbl_expense_id = '$expense'";
    ```
