- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of `assetId` during file storage in the backup restore process. Specifically, the `assetId` is directly inserted into the file name without sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the filename through a specially crafted backup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The lack of sanitization of the `assetId` when constructing the filename allows an attacker to introduce characters like `../` to traverse directories and write files to arbitrary locations within the server's file system.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By writing malicious files to arbitrary locations on the server, an attacker can achieve remote code execution. This can be done by overwriting existing system files or placing new executable files.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - **Malicious Backup:** An attacker crafts a malicious backup archive containing specially crafted `.asset` files and corresponding JSON event files.
  - **`squidex.admin.restore` privilege:** The attacker needs to have the `squidex.admin.restore` privilege to initiate the backup restore process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with the `squidex.admin.restore` permission.
  - **Malicious Backup Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious backup with a crafted `assetId`.
