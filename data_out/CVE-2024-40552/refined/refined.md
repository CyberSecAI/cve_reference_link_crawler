Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a combination of two issues:
1.  **Command Injection via `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`:** The `ScriptComponent.java` uses `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` with a controllable `cmdarray` parameter, allowing for command execution if manipulated.
2.  **Arbitrary File Write via `CmsFileUtils#replaceFileList`:** The `CmsFileUtils#replaceFileList` method allows arbitrary file content replacement due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled file paths in `CmsTemplateAdminController.java`. This allows an attacker to write malicious code into a file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unvalidated input:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for command parameters, specifically within the `SysSiteAdminController` and `CmsTemplateAdminController`. This lack of validation allows for the manipulation of file paths and command parameters.
*   **Direct command execution:** The use of `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` with user-controlled input directly translates to a command injection vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary file write:** The `replaceFileList` method allows the replacement of file contents with attacker-controlled content via the `CmsTemplateAdminController`, leading to the ability to write malicious scripts to the file system.
*   **Path traversal:** The `replaceFileList` method does not filter `../` allowing modification of files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary command execution on the server hosting the application. This can lead to:

*   **Complete system compromise:** The attacker can execute arbitrary system commands, gaining full control of the server.
*   **Data breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Malware installation:** The attacker can install malware, such as backdoors, to maintain persistent access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could potentially crash the server or disrupt services.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the following endpoints:

1.  `/admin/sysSite/execScript`: Used to trigger script creation and execution
2.  `/admin/cmsTemplate/replace`: Used to modify the contents of arbitrary files

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **HTTP request knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP POST requests with the correct parameters.

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  The attacker sends a POST request to `/admin/sysSite/execScript` to create the `sync.sh` script file.
2.  The attacker sends a POST request to `/admin/cmsTemplate/replace` to write malicious commands into the `sync.sh` file by exploiting the arbitrary file write vulnerability and the lack of path traversal filtering.
3.  The attacker sends another POST request to `/admin/sysSite/execScript` to trigger the execution of the modified `sync.sh` script.
