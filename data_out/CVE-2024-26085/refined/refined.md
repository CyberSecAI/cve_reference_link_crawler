- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) due to improper handling of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks where a user with low privileges can inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server. When a higher privileged user views the injected content, the script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs low-level privileges to inject the malicious scripts. A user with higher privileges needs to view the malicious content for the attack to be successful.
