- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack vector that targets the RelayState of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XSS vulnerability in the SAML RelayState handling leading to session leakage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** User session leakage, leading to authentication bypass and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack exploiting a vulnerability in the SAML implementation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SAML response to trigger the XSS vulnerability and requires user interaction, specifically through their browser session.
