Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-23595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue found in version 5.6 of the `yzmcms` application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF: The application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially perform unauthorized actions on the `yzmcms` application. The specific actions are not detailed, but the vulnerability allows an attacker to use a logged in user's session without their consent. The provided proof of concept (PoC) suggests that the impact could be modifying data, since the reported test is to modify the content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious web page or link that triggers a request to the vulnerable application while the user is authenticated. A user with a valid session to `yzmcms` is targeted to visit a malicious webpage, that would trigger an unintended action in `yzmcms`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that targets the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to induce a logged in user of `yzmcms` to visit a webpage controlled by the attacker, or otherwise trick the victim into triggering the request (e.g. via email).
- The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable server, or the credentials of the user to make use of this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes links to a proof of concept (PoC) video and image, however those are not directly viewable or extractable.
- The issue was reported and closed, suggesting that a fix was implemented.
- The issue report is for version 5.6, and does not provide details on other vulnerable versions.
