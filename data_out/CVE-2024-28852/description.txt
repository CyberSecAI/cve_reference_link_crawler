Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager. Ampache has multiple reflective XSS vulnerabilities,this means that all forms in the Ampache that use `rule` as a variable are not secure. For example, when querying a song, when querying a podcast, we need to use `$rule` variable. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.3.1
