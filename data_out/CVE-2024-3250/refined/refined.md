- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `pebble pull` API, which is used to read files from the workload container, allows access from any user instead of only admin users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization, specifically missing access control checks on the `GET /v1/files?action=read` API endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access to the container host can use the `pebble pull` API to read any file within the workload container, potentially exposing sensitive information like SSH keys or database passwords. This could then lead to further exploitation, such as SSH access to the workload or database access.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable via the `GET /v1/files?action=read` API endpoint of the Pebble service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local user access to the container host to exploit this vulnerability.
