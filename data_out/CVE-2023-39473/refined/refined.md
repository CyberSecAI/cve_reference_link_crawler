**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `AbstractGatewayFunction` class, which leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data
- Improper input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the affected Inductive Automation Ignition installation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted user-supplied data to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
