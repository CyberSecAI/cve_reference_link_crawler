- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software does not properly validate user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to arbitrary file read. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-36, which is related to Path Traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system. This could potentially expose sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, using a crafted HTTP request sent to the affected device's web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker is remote and needs network access to the vulnerable system.
