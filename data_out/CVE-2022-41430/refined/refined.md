The provided content details three distinct heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities found in Bento4, a multimedia processing library.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_Atom::TypeFromString(char const*)`.
*   **Weakness:** The `AP4_Atom::TypeFromString` function attempts to read a string, and if the provided string is too large, it results in writing past the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted input to `mp4tag` tool when using the `--remove` option.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a specific input file to `mp4tag`.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits(unsigned int)`.
*  **Weakness:** The `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits` function reads a specified number of bits from a buffer, and it appears that the function doesn't properly check for boundary conditions and reads out of bounds of the allocated memory.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted input to `mp4mux` tool when using the `--track h264` option.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a specific input file to `mp4mux`.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit()`.
*   **Weakness:** The `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit` function, which is used to read a single bit from a bit stream, appears to not properly handle cases where it attempts to read past the end of allocated buffer, resulting in a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted input to `mp4mux` tool when using the `--track h264` option.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a specific input file to `mp4mux`.

The provided information includes:
*   Detailed crash logs from AddressSanitizer (ASan), showing the exact locations of the buffer overflows, the affected functions, and the call stacks.
*   Specific commands to trigger the vulnerabilities with `mp4tag` and `mp4mux`.
*   Proof-of-concept (POC) files for each vulnerability.
*   The affected versions of Bento4 (master branch and release version 1.6.0-639).
*   The environment used for testing (Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS, clang 12.0.1).
