    <p>This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
       of Apache Tomcat<sup>&reg;</sup> 10.x. Each vulnerability is given a
       <a href="security-impact.html">security impact rating</a> by the Apache
       Tomcat security team &mdash; please note that this rating may vary from
       platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
       is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
       version with a question mark.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
       but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
       provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.</p>

    <p><strong>Please note that Tomcat 10.0.x has reached
       <a href="tomcat-10.0-eol.html">end of life</a> and is no longer supported.
       Vulnerabilities reported after 31 October 2022 were not checked against the
       10.0.x branch and will not be fixed. Users should upgrade to 10.1.x or
       later to obtain security fixes.</strong></p>

    <p>Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
       apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
       Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 10.0.x those are
       <a href="/tomcat-10.0-doc/building.html"><code>building.html</code></a> and
       <a href="/tomcat-10.0-doc/BUILDING.txt"><code>BUILDING.txt</code></a>.
       Both files can be found in the <code>webapps/docs</code> subdirectory
       of a binary distribution. You may also want to review the
       <a href="/tomcat-10.0-doc/security-howto.html">Security Considerations</a>
       page in the documentation.</p>

    <p>If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on

    <p>If the default servlet is write enabled (<code>readonly</code>
       initialisation parameter set to the non-default value of
       <code>false</code>) for a case insensitive file system, concurrent read
       and upload under load of the same file can bypass Tomcat's case
       sensitivity checks and cause an uploaded file to be treated as a JSP
       leading to remote code execution.</p>

    <p>If Tomcat was configured to use a custom Jakarta Authentication (formerly
       JASPIC) ServerAuthContext component which may throw an exception during
       the authentication process without explicitly setting an HTTP status to
       indicate failure, the authentication may not have failed, allowing the
       user to bypass the authentication process. There are no known Jakarta
       Authentication components that behave in this way.</p>

    <p>When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of
       excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active

       closed.</p>

    <p>Apache Tomcat did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request

       incorrectly ignored the transfer-encoding header if the client declared
       it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response; Tomcat honoured the identify
       encoding; and Tomcat did not ensure that, if present, the chunked

    <p>An error introduced as part of a change to improve error handling during
       non-blocking I/O meant that the error flag associated with the Request
       object was not reset between requests. This meant that once a

       request object would fail. Users were able to trigger non-blocking I/O
       errors, e.g. by dropping a connection, thereby creating the possibility

    <p>While investigating issue <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64830">64830</a> it was discovered that Apache

       <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13934" rel="nofollow">CVE-2020-13934</a></p>

    <p>An h2c direct connection did not release the HTTP/1.1 processor after the
       upgrade to HTTP/2. If a sufficient number of such requests were made, an
       OutOfMemoryException could occur leading to a denial of service.</p>

    <p>This was fixed with commit
       <a href="https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/c9167ae30f3b03b112f3d81772e3450b7d0e6a25">c9167ae3</a>.</p>

    <p>This issue was reported publicly via the Apache Tomcat Users mailing list
       on 22 June 2020 without reference to the potential for DoS. After further
       discussion to identify the steps necessary to reproduce the issue, the
       root cause of the issue and the associated DoS risks were identified by
       the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 26 June 2020. The issue was made
       public on 14 July 2020.</p>

    <p>Affects: 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M6</p>

    <p>A specially crafted sequence of HTTP/2 requests could trigger high CPU
       usage for several seconds. If a sufficient number of such requests were
       made on concurrent HTTP/2 connections, the server could become
       unresponsive.</p>

    <p>This was fixed with commit

    <p>This issue was reported publicly via the Apache Tomcat Users mailing list
       on 21 May 2020 without reference to the potential for DoS. The DoS risks
       were identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team the same day. The
       issue was made  public on 25 June 2020.</p>

    <p><strong>Important: Remote Code Execution via session persistence</strong>
       <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484" rel="nofollow">CVE-2020-9484</a></p>

    <p>If:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the
          server; and</li>
      <li>the server is configured to use the <code>PersistenceManager</code>
          with a <code>FileStore</code>; and</li>
      <li>the <code>PersistenceManager</code> is configured with
          <code>sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter="null"</code> (the default
          unless a <code>SecurityManager</code> is used) or a sufficiently lax
          filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized;
          and</li>
      <li>the attacker knows the relative file path from the storage location
          used by <code>FileStore</code> to the file the attacker has control
          over;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>then, using a specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able to
       trigger remote code execution via deserialization of the file under their
       control.</p>
       
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> All of conditions above must be true for the
       attack to succeed.</p>

    <p>As an alternative to upgrading to 10.0.0-M5 or later, users may configure
       the <code>PersistenceManager</code> with an appropriate value for
       <code>sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter</code> to ensure that only
       application provided attributes are serialized and deserialized.</p>

    <p>This was fixed with commit

    <p><strong>Critical: Remote Code Execution via log4j</strong>
       <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228" rel="nofollow">CVE-2021-44228</a></p>

    <p>Apache Tomcat 10.x has no dependency on any version of log4j.</p>
    
    <p>Web applications deployed on Apache Tomcat may have a dependency on
       log4j. You should seek support from the application vendor in this
       instance.</p>
    
    <p>It is possible to configure Apache Tomcat 10.x to use log4j 2.x for
       Tomcat's internal logging. This requires explicit configuration and the
       addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched Tomcat's
       internal logging to log4j 2.x is likely to need to address this
       vulnerability.</p>
   
    <p>In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest
       solution. Exactly how to do that depends on the exact version of log4j
       2.x being used. Details are provided on the
       <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html">log4j 2.x
       security page</a>.</p>
