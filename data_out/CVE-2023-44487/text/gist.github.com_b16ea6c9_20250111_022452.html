# Potential remediation

### NGINX

## can be configured to mitigate the vulnerability

* Disabling HTTP/2 in NGINX is not necessary. Simply ensure you have configured:

  + `keepalive_requests` should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests
  + `http2_max_concurrent_streams` should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams
  + `limit_conn` and `limit_req` should be set "with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security"

## If you want to remove `http2` support

* Remove reference to `http2` in the listening part

### DDoS protection / CDNs

Web apps that are behind the following DDoS protection providers / CDNs should not be impacted:

* AWS
* Cloudflare
* Google Cloud
* Microsoft Azure

You can prevent the openssl command from hanging by echoing input. Can also remove stderr output by redirecting stderr to stdout.

`echo 1 | openssl s_client -alpn h2 -connect google.com:443 -status 2>&1 | grep "ALPN"`

The blog also says that, in addition of keeping those at its default values, you should add [limit\_conn](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_conn_module.html) and [limit\_req](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html) "with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security"

[@ion-storm](https://github.com/ion-storm) There is a [pcap](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/files/2023/10/Rapid-Reset-1.pcapng) from Cloudflare. Suricata rule would be indeed a good idea.

NGINX mitigation: please note the nginx.com blog has been updated to separate *essential* configuration from *recommended*.

I wrote a [tool that implements a sparse HTTP/2 client](https://github.com/secengjeff/rapidresetclient) and emulates this attack. It can be used to test system behavior to rapid HEADERS + RST\_STREAM frames.

Apache Tomcat [apache/tomcat@9cdfe25](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/9cdfe25bad707f34b3e5da2994f3f1952a163c3e) was backported to the released 11.1.14. However, this version had a regression. So, it is better to use 11.1.15
