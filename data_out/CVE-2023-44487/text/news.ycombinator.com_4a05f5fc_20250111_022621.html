Why would anyone be willing to spend large amounts of money and develop a sophisticated attack against corporate cloud infrastructure? It seems like the only reasonable answer is foreign governments. But still what is the result - you inconvenience American tech companies and their customers for a few hours? This happens all the time, so clearly someone finds it worthwhile. Can anyone help me understand? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jedberg](user?id=jedberg) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37833074)   | [parent](#37832756) | [next](#37832817) [–]  I've been working on anti-DDOS off and on for 20 years now. The answer is sometimes government actors, but oftentimes scammers in Eastern Europe. They do these big attacks for street cred amongst the botting community. They then use their street cred to get paid by less scrupulous actors to attack their rivals. Sometimes the people paying are governments, sometimes just shady companies. For example last year there was a lot of crypto companies attacking each other's websites. Most of the people who do this have a lot of technical skill but not a lot of opportunity to get paid for it based on where they live or the circumstances of their upbringing. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jessriedel](user?id=jessriedel) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37833703)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37833074) | [next](#37835558) [–]  Very useful, thanks.

A single client request may result in 100x the work for the server.

Canceling the requests before a response is written reduces downlink (server/proxy to attacker) bandwidth. How is this an advantage? Can someone explain please? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jseutter](user?id=jseutter) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37835872)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37835658) | [next](#37835768) [–]  It's an advantage because you as a botnet client have made the server side do extra work. You sent two packets, one to request a new connection, and a second to immediately cancel the request. The server on the other hand sees a connection request and does some work like allocating memory and fetching the resource you requested. Once the server starts sending the response back to the client via the reverse proxy, the reverse proxy notices the request is no longer current and just drops the response on the floor. As a result, you made the server do some amount of work and you don't have to worry about saturating your internet connection. They call this a magnification attack because for the cost of two requests you made the server do some multiple of work. You could add some smarts to the server or reverse proxy that delays starting work in case a cancellation request quickly arrives. This is probably part of the mitigation work they refer to in the article. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [xnx](user?id=xnx) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37835768)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37835658) | [prev](#37835872) | [next](#37836040) [–]  The attacking system is shooting a firehose of requests at the target system, but doesn't have to deal with handling any responses being sent back to the requesting systems. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [imheretolearn](user?id=imheretolearn) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37835813)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37835768) | [next](#37836040) [–]  Makes sense, thank you! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [NoThankYouTho](user?id=NoThankYouTho) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37836040)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37834196) | [prev](#37835658) | [next](#37834942) [–]  This is sort of an aside based on something I read in the article but does anyone know why the RFC guidelines say that you should first send an informational GOAWAY that does not prevent opening new streams when gracefully closing a connection? They point out in the article that it's a better practice to immediately limit stream creation when you detect abuse - not wait for a round trip to complete first. I'm sure there's a good reason for the original guidelines; I'm just trying to get it and haven't found anything clarifying through Google. Was it specified before the rise of modern attacks? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Guvante](user?id=Guvante) [on Oct 11, 2023](item?id=37840359)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37836040) | [next](#37834942) [–]  How do you act on a GOAWAY you haven't received and allowing the server to unilaterally stop supporting things can lead to weird edge cases. After all you could say any client ignoring a GOAWAY is either bugged or malicious but certainly not until you get confirmation they go it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [KomoD](user?id=KomoD) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37834942)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37834196) | [prev](#37836040) | [next](#37843607) [–]  Yep: "a client can send a RST\_STREAM frame for a single stream. This instructs the server to stop processing the request and to abort the response, which frees up server resources and avoids wasting bandwidth." Pretty clever | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wtarreau](user?id=wtarreau) [on Oct 11, 2023](item?id=37843607)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37834050) | [prev](#37834196) | [next](#37840644) [–]  Of course. Depending on the machine and on the network, a single modern machine can do even up to a few millions RPS. This is routinely used in benchmarking tools. Here with the "attack", it's simply exploiting the ability of HTTP/2 to compress requests and reduce them to just a few bytes, meaning that within a few kilobytes of data you can easily have hundreds of requests. Again this is not new and was already being discussed in 2012 about SPDY's use of zlib to compress requests. The extra stuff that seems to have made this attack "new" for such service providers is that attackers took care of closing their requests so as not to have to wait for a response and be able to fill the wire with a flow of request. Again this has been known from the inception of HTTP/2 and routinely met by those dealing with proxies which timeout and send headers followed by rst\_stream. Here it makes noise because new records were broken, and likely because the stacks in place were not properly designed so they omitted to check for the *real* number of streams and only focused on the protocol validity... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [southernplaces7](user?id=southernplaces7) [on Oct 11, 2023](item?id=37840644)   | [root](#37832756) | [parent](#37833805) | [prev](#37834050) | [next](#37833933) [–]  If this attack takes only 20,000 machines to orchestrate, how is it the "largest DDoS attack to date"?

This technique wasn't known previously, or wasn't viable when HTTP/2 wasn't widespread. This technique is a ~100x multiplier on the impact any size botnet can have.

My bet is on the latter. Enshitification is a direct product of greed. No crafts person or creator I know of goes into something they enjoy creating with the intent to make it this monstrosity of money extraction. Most creators have a drive for their creation to be shared and experienced by many. Yes, you may want to get a reward in the process and for some creators, their motives may change over time if they see an opportunity to turn their creation into a wealth machine for themselves so they can do whatever after. Enshitification I believe is a secondary effect of something that becomes successful for the owners of something and either they or others change motives towards value. Optimization is no longer about the creation, sharing, experience, humanitarian, whatever motive and shifts to money. The second that becomes the goal, enshitication is just part of the optimization journey. In my line of thinking, it's the same reason monopolies or near monopolies tend to form, these are merely further states along optimization strategies in the monetary/wealth extraction goal. Part of that process is that when something starts to succeed, it attracts people with these goals so the goal of something shifts pretty rapidly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [andrei\_says\_](user?id=andrei_says_) [on Oct 11, 2023](item?id=37839933)   | [root](#37831230) | [parent](#37832344) | [next](#37831843) [–]  This is beautifully written, thank you. As a creator, my money ambitions fit between “does this thing provide enough value to pay for itself” and “could this provide enough value to pay for my needs”. The drive to create the thing comes from sincere enthusiasm + excitement that simply don’t leave me alone. Shifting the thing’s purpose from the original one that filled me with enthusiasm to the purpose of simply extracting money, corrupts its original purpose. I call this corruption. it is my observation that one kind of people create, and another kind of people corrupt. Unfortunately the economic system we have accepted as normal, leans toward corruption and extraction. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nordsieck](user?id=nordsieck) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37831843)   | [root](#37831230) | [parent](#37831359) | [prev](#37832344) | [next](#37831397) [–]  > if Google wasn't there and Altavista was the incumbent, would it be any different, or was the enshittification of search inevitable?

TL;DR: HTTP/2 is internally concurrent, can handle multiple streams. It is possible in HTTP/2 to send a nasty request that looks like so: ```   - GET x1   - GET x2   - GET x3   - ...   - GET x100   - Actually, cancel all of the above (uses multiple RST_STREAM frames)   - GET x101   - GET x102   - (...)   - GET x200   - Actually, cancel all of the above (uses multiple RST_STREAM frames)   - (...)  ``` This can be repeated a lot of times. The problem is that the endpoint, which typically is a reverse proxy, might start dispatching the requests before it reads about their cancellation. And sure it will cancel them, but by the time of cancellation it will already have resulted in some resource usage downstream. Such requests are accepted because at no point the client has opened more than 100 streams, which is the typical concurrency limit. The example from the blog manages to squeze in a single packet 1000 GETs (i.e. 1000 HEADERS) correctly interleaved with RST\_STREAM. Maybe it's just me, but it's always fun to see such creative and simple abuses of protocols/code. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ryanisnan](user?id=ryanisnan) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37834486)   | [root](#37831250) | [parent](#37832487) | [next](#37834741) [–]  That’s pretty fascinating.

A lot of DDoS traffic isn't actual HTTP traffic, it can be garbage targetted at your IP address to "fill the pipes" (bigger pipes help, as well as having multiple server geographically distributed). Some can be TCP SYN flood, to just open TCP connections and exhaust available ports. Etc. Oftentimes, multiple simple reverse proxies can handle these malformed requests in front of your server. Then, for the most sophisticated queries that send seemingly-legitimate HTTP traffic, one has to handle them... It could be serving requests from a cache, adding captchas to slow attackers and identify legitimate traffic, enforcing rate limits, etc. Usually, you'd like to be able to tell if a request is legitimate or not before forwarding it to the actual server, and you can deploy all sorts of tools to do so. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [toast0](user?id=toast0) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37833281)   | [root](#37831254) | [parent](#37831384) | [next](#37831289) [–]  > it usually involves being able to dynamically scale up your bandwidth and compute power to cope with the incoming flood. I don't think this is right. If you have a meaningful amount of bandwidth, dynamically scaling it is getting a connection upgraded in weeks instead of months. If you don't have a meaningful amount of bandwidth, you're rely on your provider(s) to have enough bandwidth and again, they can't expand quickly. > Some can be TCP SYN flood, to just open TCP connections and exhaust available ports. If you have a tcp stack from maybe 2003 or later (so excluding macos, unless they changed something in the past four years), it will have synflood protection, with syncookies. In the event of a heavy synflood, your system will send at most one syn+ack per incoming syn, and actually accept connections on the incoming ack. Yes, you miss out on detailed tcp options, but it's not that big of a deal, unless the volume impacts your available bandwidth. Also, as a tcp server, you can't meaningfuly run out of ports; your one listen ip:port can connect to all ip:ports, if you have the memory for it. You'll probably run out of total accepted sockets, but there's no real resource limit on partially accepted connections, because of syncookies. It can be much more draining when DDoS clients actually hold connections. But it's often simply about volumetrics, and it's easier to generate a high volume of SYN packets than to hold a connection. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [richardwhiuk](user?id=richardwhiuk) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37831289)   | [parent](#37831254) | [prev](#37831384) | [next](#37832039) [–]  Cloudflare, and other companies, can detect that requests are DDoS and either drop, throttle, or verify the traffic, instead of forwarding it your server.

The way we used to do it is have "filter boxes" with a real anycast IP address's which reverse connect to your origin.

Privacy, long term, will mean the fall of civilization. Sarcasm aside. I think I understand your point in which we shouldn't just delegate to cloud providers the whole effort in preventing attacks, but just with everything production-grade, the average enterprise just isn't ready to deal with all the upfront cost to run your entire computing solution. Because it doesn't end with this type of mitigation and dependency. A similar argument could be made for not using proprietary chip designs made by cloud providers. Or any proprietary API solution for that matter. It really is a matter of convenience that a community solution might cover in the future, abstracting away fundamental building blocks every cloud provider must have (name resolution, network, storage and computing services) to provide such higher level functions without lock in.

We’re not even trying to make the internet safe. There is zero (0) actions being taken to stop this madness. If you run a large website, you still regularly see attacks from routers compromised 3, 4, 5 years ago.

Why are these threats allowed to still exist? The only ones attempting something are governments shutting down booters (DDoS-as-a-service platforms). But that’s treating symptoms, not causes. We will eventually need to do something, or it will be impossible to run a website that can’t be kicked down for free by the next bored skid.

What would make it right is for there to be a more generalized remote blackholing system in place. ie my site runs on an IP, is able to tell my ISP to reject traffic to it from $sources, and my ISP can send that request to the source ISP.

Back in the day when the main bot net activity was spam if you were infected and you started sending TB of spam the ISP would first block your outgoing smtp.

As a relatively clueless kid I decided to portscan an IP range belonging to a mobile service company. Few days later my dad got a phone call saying their IDS flagged it and "don't do it or we'll cancel your service". For a port scan of few public IPs no less!

Back then, you got a piece of land, and really could do what you wanted with it. Build a business, farm, etc. some government taxes but nothing crazy. But you had to deal with criminals, lack of access to medical care, and lack of education. Now to do the same, you have a slew of building codes, regulations, zoning laws, and are basically forced to have municipal services. Higher Taxes to pay the roads, police force, fire fighters, education services etc. However, home owners can still just have an egg or vegetable stand at the end of their driveway. It won’t be the same as having a storefront in town, but it’s still doable without the overhead. Similarly, as the internet matures, we’re going to see more and more overhead to sustain a “basic” business. But you can still have a personal blog ran in your closet, for lower-level traffic. The analogy isn’t perfect, but unfortunately as threat-actor’s budgets increase, so too do their quality/sophistication of their attacks. If it was cheap to defend against some of the more costly attacks, they would find a different vector. The answer, to me, is some tangential technology that is some mix of federated or decentralization. Not in a crypto bro sense, but just some tech whose fundamental design solves the inherit problem with how our web is built today.

How would you go about maintaing that physical copy updated? What I think would make this approach hard is that you would have to ponder if a newly created account is important at creation time in order to know if you should update the off-site, physical copy of your most important passwords (I say this because if you want to backup everything and avoid the cloud entirely it is just not viable, having to update this physical backup for each new account. I am currently at over 400 logins in my pw manager, 2 years ago it was half as much). I think having your passwords encrypted with a high enough entropy master password and a quantum-resistant encryption algorithm, and having an off-site, physical backup of your cloud account credentials is enough for anyone not publicly exposed, like a politician or someone extremely wealthy, even though I would be skeptical these people go through such lengths to protect their online accounts. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rglullis](user?id=rglullis) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37833233)   | [root](#37831290) | [parent](#37832886) | [next](#37833654) [–]  The lesson is not to "avoid" the cloud, but to not be "dependent" on it. Doubly so if the service provided is one that keeps you locked in and can not be ported over. So yes, I feel comfortable with my strategy of having backups on bluray disks + S3. If AWS goes down or decides to jack up their prices to something unacceptable, I will take the physical copies and move then to the dozen others S3-compatible alternatives. I am not *dependent* on AWS.

There is no way for a router to send a packet to you in a way where you can reply to that router unless you are connected directly to it, unless all ISP routers start being assigned public IP addresses. Additionally, there are normally many paths between you and your attacker, and there is no guarantee that packets you send will take the same path as the packets you were receiving. Especially as the routing rules get modified by your successful blocking requests. That also means that every router now has to maintain a connection table to keep track of all of the pending confirmations, and to periodically check that table for expirations so it can clean it up. Maybe not that bad for a local router, but this is completely unworkable for routers handling larger parts of the internet. And of course, anyone who has a tap into that level can trivially spoof all of the correct replies so it's still not a secure mechanism. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [codedokode](user?id=codedokode) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37831911)   | [root](#37831290) | [parent](#37831836) | [prev](#37831871) | [next](#37831938) [–]  You can deny access only from your IP, not for anyone else. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hnlmorg](user?id=hnlmorg) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37832221)   | [root](#37831290) | [parent](#37831911) | [next](#37832172) [–]  IP addresses can be spoofed.

Some newer protocols are designed to limit the potential of reflected responses. Null routing is available in some situations, but of course it's not very specific: hey upstreams (and maybe their upstreams), drop all packets to my specific IP. My understanding is null routing is often done via BGP, so all the things (nice and not) that come with that. Asking for deeper packet inspection than looking at the destination is asking for router ASICs to change their programing; it's unlikely to happen. Anyway, the distributed nature of DDoS means you'd need hundreds of thousands of rules, and nobody will be willing to add that. Null routing is effective, but of course it takes you IP offline.

I'd imagine that the website owners that want the attack stopped will soon want to figure out how to get traffic back since they need users to pay the bills. Whats to stop someone from just making an app that participates in an attack when connected to public(ish) wifi networks and participating in attacks long enough to get those all shut off from major sites? How does this stop entire ISPs from getting shut off when the attackers have managed to cycle through all the IP pools used for natting connections? (e.g. the Comcasts of the world that use cg-nat to multiplex very large numbers of people to very small numbers of IPs)? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [codedokode](user?id=codedokode) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37835698)   | [root](#37831290) | [parent](#37833513) | [next](#37839595) [–]  > How does one get removed from the block list?

Which is to say that Google playing it safer and safer actually causes their potential adversaries to become stronger and stronger. You can see those paradoxes at play throughout the corporate world and especially when it comes to actual combat/war (to which actual combat/war these DOSes might actually be connected). For example the fact that Israel was relatively successful in implementing its Iron Dome shield only incentivised their adversaries to get hold of even more rockets, so that the sheer number of rockets alone would be able to overwhelm said Iron Dome. That's how Hamas got to firing ~4,000 rockets in one single day recently, that number was out of their league several years ago when Iron Dome was not yet functional. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [myth\_drannon](user?id=myth_drannon) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37837314)   | [root](#37831290) | [parent](#37833041) | [next](#37832236) [–]  It's the opposite, the number of rocket was growing and hence the Iron Dome was developed.

The fact that millions, if no more, devices can continue to access the internet regardless of how long they are compromised, is just crazy. I get that it put more responsibility upon end users to secure their devices, if they otherwise run the risk of get thrown of the internet, but I currently fail to see other options. Our device security still isn't good enough that we can just use them with reckless abandonment. Any "solution" that attempts to fix the problem of increasing DDoS attacks and their damage that doesn't address the issue of compromised devices being allowed to roam free on the internet is a band aid at best.

The problem is that ISPs whose customers are originating the attacks from don’t give a shit. If we have to give up 1% of legitimate traffic to thwart 90% of attacks, it is a good deal. If you and other customers complain to your ISP (or switch), eventually they’ll do something about it.

The net is currently broken in many ways. One of the many ways is fake negative reviews. They easily destroy small businesses. As I understand your argument, because the net has solid endpoints we can identify and isolate, we should ignore that fact. Instead we should create more and more complex systems to work around bad actors? Bad actor takes control of grandma's computer. We should do all sorts of things except stop talking to grandma's computer? The thing, I would suspect, that most people would expect? Businesses suffer from too much transparency. Got that part. They buy things that don't work and sometimes hurt people, even if they don't intend to do this. So far, so good. Where is the part where new businesses models are supposed to exist because some people made bad choices and the current models don't work? Why don't we just publicize the bad choices and let things work themselves out? Sorry.

It's proper feedback which can be acted upon. Every reasonable connectivity provider would pay attention to this info, or face intense complaints from its users with shared and dynamic IPs. It would identify sources of attacks, and block them at higher granularity level, reporting that the range has been cleared. (If a provider lied, everyone would stop believing it, and the disgruntled customers would leave it.) For shared hosting providers it would mean blocking specific user accounts using a firewall, notifying users, and maybe even selling cleanup services. For home internet users, it also would mean blocking specific users, contacting them, helping them identify the infected machine at home. It would massively drive patching of old router firmware which is often cracked and infected. Same for IoT stuff, infected PCs, malicious apps on phones, etc. There would be an incentive to stay clean. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [scrpl](user?id=scrpl) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37831912)   | [root](#37831290) | [parent](#37831793) | [next](#37831857) [–]  If the one doing the blocking is not at FAANG it would do nothing of sorts.

Therefore we need to add yet another layer to the mix, the cloud providers, and start paying those guys. And yes, we can block entire subnets. You own the IP addresses, you're responsible for stuff coming out of them, at least to the degree that it's not maliscious to the web as a whole. (but not the content itself, of course) I'm calling bullshit on these assumptions. The internet is a communications tool. If it's not communicating, it's broken. If you provide dynamic IPs to clients that attack people, you're breaking it. It's not my problem or something I should ever be expected to pay for. To be clear, my point is that we're suggesting yet another layer of commercial, paid crap on top of a broken system in order to fix it. It'd be phenomenally better just to publicly identify place and methods where it's broken and let other folks with more vested interests than information consumers worry about it.

One of the things that gets lost in this kind of debate is that the vast, vast majority of Internet users are not experts in how the Internet, computers, or their phones work. So expecting them to be able to "just not get exploited" is a naive strategy and bringing the pain to the ISP feels counterproductive because what, realistically, can they do to stop all of their unsophisticated users from getting themselves exploited? At the end of the day, the vast majority of the users of the Internet do not care how it works - they want their email, they want their cat videos, and they want to check up on their high school ex on Facebook. How can we rearchitect the Internet to be a) open b) privacy protecting, and c) robust against these kinds of attacks so that the targets of DDOS attacks have better protection than paying a third party and hoping that that third party can protect them? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [judge2020](user?id=judge2020) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37831676)   | [root](#37831290) | [parent](#37831637) | [prev](#37831703) | [next](#37831681) [–]  How does the ISP solve it?

It has to be all or nothing, which can only be compelled by law, and we have no global laws and no global law enforcement mechanism. Some countries inevitably don't care and the rest won't partition the entire Internet by permanently cutting them off. 2 would probably make the entire Internet of Things and a whole lot of home computing just not happen because it isn't economically feasible. Poor security effectively acts as a tacit tax. We all pay a little bit each, but the tax is collected by criminals instead of governments. Note that even your proposed solution here only works if 1 happened.

What if Google and Cloudflare collectively reverse-DoSed all the infected IPs, not by sending them any traffic, but simply by refusing to accept any connections from them to any part of their infrastructure? Whoever is on those IPs will suddenly find that half the internet doesn't work anymore. Which is probably a good enough incentive for them to replace their router, format their PC, or whatever else is necessary to disinfect themselves. In many parts of the world, landline IP allocations tend to be stable enough for this to have a real effect. Phones are a different story, but phones are also much less likely to be useful in a DDoS botnet. (The owner would immediately notice the sudden heat and data usage.)

Your droplet suddenly tries to log into somebody else's server 10 times a second.

DigitalOcean assumes that the report was made in good faith, forwards it to you and immediately suspends your droplet. It won't be reactivated until you reply with evidence that you have at least tried to clean up the problem. If it happens again, you won't get off so easily. I suppose that a similar system, in a more real-time fashion, could be set up between the maintainers of the blacklist (Google, Cloudflare, Amazon, etc.) and the ISPs. No need for the ISPs to sniff on everyone's traffic if they can rely on good-faith reports from the lion's mouth that somebody from port 52384 on 11.22.33.44 is DDoSing a Google property.

In theory I could send 4M requests in second with 1 Gbps connection. 1 Tbps total connection capacity could do close to 4.3B rps given perfect distribution. I imagine distributing the load becomes harder/more expensive the bigger the scale. In real network you probably have to find the paths that don't slow you down and then strike for short time before you are banned.
