| I believe cowboy is already protected against this by this [HTTP/2 option](https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.10/manual/cowboy_http2/), which by default permits resetting 10 streams in 10 seconds:  **max\_reset\_stream\_rate (`{10, 10000}`)**  Maximum reset stream rate per connection. This can be used to protect against misbehaving or malicious peers that do not follow the protocol, leading to the server resetting streams, by limiting the number of streams that can be reset over a certain time period. The rate is expressed as a tuple `{NumResets, TimeMs}`. This is similar to a supervisor restart intensity/period.  I have not tested this though.  [Edit] I was wrong. This option only controls resets done by the server. Loïc explains it in this comment: [#1615 (comment)](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/issues/1615#issuecomment-1757688553) |

| Oh nevermind that's not exactly the same. This one is the client doing request/cancel very fast many times. I don't think we have a protection against that one. |

| I think we basically need a `max_cancel_stream_rate` that works more or less the same as `max_reset_stream_rate`. Should be an easy enough contribution if anyone wants to do it. |

| There's a protocol-level draft in <https://martinthomson.github.io/h2-stream-limits/draft-thomson-httpbis-h2-stream-limits.html> that would likely prove better long term but in the meantime a `max_cancel_stream_rate` will remain necessary. |

| Note that these protections are not enough on their own. When Cowboy closes a connection when a reset/cancel rate has been reached, nothing prevents the misbehaving client from connecting again. Cowboy does not provide block lists or other features to fully prevent the DoS, it can only make it a little more expensive to the attacker. The protocol-level draft would work out much better against attack scenarios.  I believe if you have nginx, haproxy or Apache httpd in front of Cowboy you are not affected by this issue. |

| I think we basically need a `max_cancel_stream_rate` that works more or less the same as `max_reset_stream_rate`. Should be an easy enough contribution if anyone wants to do it.  What's the difference between "cancel" and "reset"? The frame to cancel a stream is called `RST_STREAM` and this is what the existing option controls. CANCEL is only an error code, which can be used in `RST_STREAM` or `GOAWAY`. There is no other mention of "cancel" in rfc7540. What am I missing? |

| What the option controls is when the server resets the stream due to an error. From Cowboy's point of view, if the stream has to be stopped due to an error it has to reset it, but if it's the client resetting then it has to cancel the request handling.  Right now Cowboy has protections against bad requests that it has to repeatedly reset, but there's nothing for the client doing the resets (cancelling requests).  Does Cowboy parse all stream messages in one packet before acting on them? If so, it could cancel out all request/cancel pairs that essentially are no-ops before handling them  No and that would only work for request -> cancel -> request -> cancel anyway. Clients could do N requests -> N cancels. |

### **[essen](/essen)** commented [Oct 11, 2023](#issuecomment-1758554710)

| Two more relevant points.  Depending on the server, and particularly in proxies, a stream may be reset by the client but a lot of resources may still be in use while the request is being shut down. In vanilla Cowboy there is no such problem because Cowboy will shutdown the request process. This process by default does not trap exits and so will terminate immediately.  The other angle of attack is the way streams are counted. HTTP/2 has a configurable stream limit. The number of current streams is the active streams, meaning the streams which have not ended and not been reset. In the scenarios where resources stay up for a while after the reset, this becomes a big problem because those reset streams do not count toward the limit, and therefore the attacker wastes a lot of resources with each canceled request.  So applications that are likely to be affected are those that have request handlers that trap exits. Others will see a waste of resources similar to a simple flood of requests. |

### swift-nio-http2 vulnerable to HTTP/2 Stream Cancellation Attack
[CVE-2023-44487](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487) /
[GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 5.3 / 10 (Medium)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http
[CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325) /
[GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

### swift-nio-http2 vulnerable to HTTP/2 Stream Cancellation Attack
[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487>) /
[[GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3")](<https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 5.3 / 10 (Medium)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue

| Note that these protections are not enough on their own. When Cowboy closes a connection when a reset/cancel rate has been reached, nothing prevents the misbehaving client from connecting again. Cowboy does not provide block lists or other features to fully prevent the DoS, it can only make it a little more expensive to the attacker. The protocol-level draft would work out much better against attack scenarios.  I believe if you have nginx, haproxy or Apache httpd in front of Cowboy you are not affected by this issue.  We use end-to-end TLS connections and terminate TLS on the Erlang node, and we use a load balancer (nginx, haproxy, etc.) only on the TCP layer. This is to keep the data encrypted even within a semi-trusted environment. With this setup, the load balancer can handle and block DoS attacks when many connections are created, but it cannot see the rapid reset attack, which is just a single TCP connection.  I have opened a PR. |

That's fine as long as it detects the many connections we keep closing and acts on that. That's what I meant.

Sounds good but fairly expensive still to the server.  I have opened a PR.  I will take a look next week when I get back to work. Thanks! |

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Details
##### HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [[CVE-2023-39325](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8 "CVE-2023-39325")](<https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417>)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Details
##### HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http
BIT-golang-2023-39325 /
[CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325) /
[GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8)
/ [GO-2023-2102](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2102)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 7.5 / 10 (High)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [[CVE-2023-39325](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8 "CVE-2023-39325")](<https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417>)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

/ [GO-2023-2102](<https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2102>)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 7.5 / 10 (High)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
