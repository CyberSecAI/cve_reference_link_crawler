Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in nghttp2, an implementation
of the HTTP/2 protocol.

    A denial-of-service could be caused by a large HTTP/2 SETTINGS
    frame payload.

    A denial-of-service could be caused by resetting many HTTP/2
    streams quickly.  This has been observed in the wild since August.
