|  |  |  |
|  |  | Yesterday, [CVE-2023-44487](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487), a |
|  |  | DDOS vulnerability in many HTTP/2 implementations, was disclosed. This was a |
|  |  | very interesting attack and there have been several great writeups on how it |
|  |  | works—see Cloudflare's [HTTP/2 Rapid Reset: deconstructing the record-breaking |
|  |  | attack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/) |
|  |  | and Google's [How it works: The novel HTTP/2 ‘Rapid Reset’ DDoS |
|  |  | attack](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-it-works-the-novel-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack) |
|  |  | for many details of how this attack works and the consequences. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | We're happy to report that due to Linkerd's internal security policies and the |
|  |  | security-awareness and rapid response of the Rust community, all recent versions |
|  |  | of Linkerd are resilient to this class of DDOS attack. (In fact, Linkerd can |
|  |  | actually help users who have vulnerable ingress proxies—simple mesh them with |
|  |  | Linkerd and have it handle HTTP/2 traffic.) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Versions of Linkerd that are resilient to CVE-2023-44487 include: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* All versions of Linkerd 2.14.x |
|  |  | \* Linkerd 2.13.1 and all later minor versions of Linkerd 2.13 |
|  |  | \* Linkerd 2.12.5 and all later minor versions of Linkerd 2.12 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Astute Linkerd adopters will realize that these versions are all as of April |
|  |  | 2023, six months ago. This is thanks to our rigorous vulnerability mitigation |
|  |  | procedures, and to the security-mindedness and fast response of the Rust |
|  |  | community. |
| **wmorgan** marked this conversation as resolved.   Show resolved  Hide resolved | | |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Let's see just how this feat happened. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Linkerd is a security-first project |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | It's no understatement to say that Linkerd treats security as a critical |
|  |  | requirement. Organizations around the world rely on Linkerd for everything from |
|  |  | protecting sensitive customer medical and financial data, to scheduling COVID |
|  |  | tests, to building 911 call centers. For some people, Linkerd is quite literally |
|  |  | a life-or-death project. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Part of that approach is the choice of technologies like Rust, of course, which |
|  |  | allow us to avoid an entire class of buffer overflow exploits and other |
|  |  | vulnerabilities that are endemic to languages like C and C++. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | But another, just as important part is simply how seriously the project takes |
|  |  | potential security vulnerabilities. Tracing the path to resolution for |
|  |  | CVE-2023-44487 is a great example of that. Here's how it happened: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This issue was first tracked as a vulnerability in the Rust community as |
|  |  | [RUSTSEC-2023-0034](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0034.html) on |
|  |  | April 14, 2023. At that point it had actually already been fixed in h2, the |
| **wmorgan** marked this conversation as resolved.   Show resolved  Hide resolved | | |
|  |  | underlying library that Linkerd uses to parse HTTP/2 requests, as a change that |
| **wmorgan** marked this conversation as resolved.   Show resolved  Hide resolved | | |
|  |  | had gone out [on April 12th, two days |
|  |  | earlier](https://github.com/hyperium/h2/pull/668). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The fix was published in [h2 |
| **wmorgan** marked this conversation as resolved.   Show resolved  Hide resolved | | |
|  |  | v0.3.17](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0034.html). Linkerd |
|  |  | automatically pulled in that dependency [on April |
|  |  | 13th](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy/commit/67306bc7ba19286352762362e4e1876ce5924442) |
|  |  | via [GitHub's Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot), the automated |
|  |  | dependency tool that Linkerd uses to ensure it stays up-to-date with critical |
|  |  | dependencies, where it was published as [proxy release |
|  |  | v2.198.1](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy/releases/tag/release%2Fv2.198.1). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | On April 13th, the proxy version [was pulled into the main Linkerd |
|  |  | repo](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/commit/19a404fd196e251e969ac6c4a552a3c7af698dc5). |
|  |  | On April 14th, we pushed it to [Linkerd |
|  |  | 2.13.1](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.13.1)—two days |
|  |  | after the underlying fix in h2, and the same day it was recognized as an |
| **wmorgan** marked this conversation as resolved.   Show resolved  Hide resolved | | |
|  |  | vulnerability in the Rust ecosystem. The fix also went out on |
|  |  | [edge-23.4.2](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-23.4.2) on |
|  |  | April 21st, and from there it was in all future and stable releases. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In short: two days after the fix was made in the underlying Rust HTTP/2 library, |
|  |  | it was already in the hands of Linkerd users as a stable release, and all |
|  |  | Linkerd releases since April have been protected against this vulnerability. |
|  |  | While this vulnerability is making the news this week, Linkerd adopters have |
| **wmorgan** marked this conversation as resolved.   Show resolved  Hide resolved | | |
|  |  | been protected for almost 6 months. |
