[envoyproxy/envoy#30055](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/30055)

1. Set `max_concurrent_stream=100` to limit streams per connection. Helps limit memory usage.
2. Set `http.max_requests_per_io_cycle=1` to limit requests processed in one IO cycle.
3. Set `overload.premature_reset_total_stream_count=50`. This kept low enough to reduce impact.
4. Set `overload.premature_reset_min_stream_lifetime_seconds=1`.

I was working on [#5827](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/5827) while this was submitted and looks like there is some overlap

It seems pretty much all of these are set via Envoy defaults already

| Hey [@akshaysngupta](https://github.com/akshaysngupta) I don't think we will merge this PR as structured, but would rather prefer PRs that solve the targeted issues I just created and linked. I personally would not consider those blockers for a release since there are other mitigations for [CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487") in place with defaults and other Contour changes. IMO they are a nice to have that we would appreciate community contributions for. |

| [@sunjayBhatia](https://github.com/sunjayBhatia) those other defaults are not enough. Contour-managed Envoy are getting OOM killed within the first 5 seconds (depends on memory allocated) of the attack without a limit on the max streams. But it also makes sense to keep this configurable. Sadly, I don't have the bandwidth right now to make the contribution.  What are the options that users have until this setting is exposed to mitigate the attack? Should users build their own custom Contour images to have some sort of mitigation? How will the users discover the settings that will help mitigate ? |

### swift-nio-http2 vulnerable to HTTP/2 Stream Cancellation Attack
[CVE-2023-44487](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487) /
[GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 5.3 / 10 (Medium)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http
[CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325) /
[GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity
Moderate

limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

### swift-nio-http2 vulnerable to HTTP/2 Stream Cancellation Attack
[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487>) /
[[GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3")](<https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 5.3 / 10 (Medium)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

| Hi [@akshaysngupta](https://github.com/akshaysngupta) ,  We are also investigating how new Contour parameters shall be introduced due to the rapid reset attack. And you mentioned:  Contour-managed Envoy are getting OOM killed within the first 5 seconds (depends on memory allocated) of the attack without a limit on the max streams.  Did you refer to [max-concurrent-streams](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/core/v3/protocol.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-config-core-v3-http2protocoloptions-max-concurrent-streamsl) of Envoy? If yes then can you please explain a little bit how it is related to the rapid reset attack? My understanding is that this is actually one of the main points of the attack that prematurely closed streams by RSTs are not counted in the [max-concurrent-streams](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/core/v3/protocol.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-config-core-v3-http2protocoloptions-max-concurrent-streamsl).  Or exposing this parameter in general is useful since its high default value can be exploited easily even without the rapid reset attack? |

| That's right. Rapid resets don't increase the stream count. This helps with later where attacker creates too many streams. |

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Details
##### HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [[CVE-2023-39325](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8 "CVE-2023-39325")](<https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417>)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Details
##### HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http
BIT-golang-2023-39325 /
[CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325) /
[GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8)
/ [GO-2023-2102](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2102)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 7.5 / 10 (High)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [[CVE-2023-39325](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8 "CVE-2023-39325")](<https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417>)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

/ [GO-2023-2102](<https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2102>)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 7.5 / 10 (High)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
