| The fix in apiserver seems a little bit more involved than just bumping dependencies: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121120/files>  Thanks [@tjungblu](https://github.com/tjungblu) for pointing this out. (I am not an api-server expert) based on the PR, it seems api-server made two changes:   * In `(r *rudimentaryErrorBackoff) OnError(error)`, do not sleep with the lock, so as not to block all callers; * Do not allow unauthenticated clients to keep the connections open;   I don't think etcd has similar problems (note K8s doesn't enable auth at all).  Another thing... I noticed that Kubernetes hasn't bumped grpc-go version yet (note latest grpc-go versions have fix to [CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")), I guess probably it's because api-server doesn't start grpc server at all.

| Bump grpc-go: 1.56.3 or 1.57.1 or 1.58.3 for 3.4/3.5.  Just took a quick peak at the gRPC dependency upgrade history on the difference of 3.4 and 3.5:   1. [tools: Update tools & go.mod for protos (gogo/protobuf 1.3.1, grpc 1.29.1, grpc-gateway 1.14.6) #12397](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12397) 2. [Update grpc dependency to 1.32. #12709](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12709) 3. [Update dep: github.com/golang/protobuf v1.3.5 ->  v1.5.1, grpc: 1.32->1.36 #12801](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12801) 4. [Add initial Tracing with OpenTelemetry #12919](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12919) 5. [backport-3.5: Update of dependencies:zap, bbolt, grpc, ... #13079](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13079) 6. [[3.5] etcdserver: bump OpenTelemetry to 1.0.1 and gRPC to 1.41.0 #14312](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14312)   I think goal will be let 3.4 catch up with 3.5 first, ignore other unrelated dependency upgrade and eventually upgrade to `1.58.3`, correct?  Is there any major call outs this upgrade could potentially break 3.4 release? [@ahrtr](https://github.com/ahrtr) [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius) [@fuweid](https://github.com/fuweid) |

| I think goal will be let 3.4 catch up with 3.5 first, ignore other unrelated dependency upgrade and eventually upgrade to `1.58.3`, correct?  I am good as long as eventually we can resolve the CVE for both 3.5 and 3.4.  Is there any major call outs this upgrade could potentially break 3.4 release? [@ahrtr](https://github.com/ahrtr) [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius) [@fuweid](https://github.com/fuweid)  No immediate call out in my head for now. We can have more discussion if we run into any issue during the upgrade. thx |

| Just quick bump the version in my local for v3.4. It might introduce other changes, such as [#12675](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12675). We might need to try to bump and get the changes result and then evaluate it. |

Another such example: [#12671](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12671)  <https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.30.0>   1. This release removed the deprecated `naming` package that etcd `3.4` depends on in <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/release-3.4/clientv3/naming/grpc.go#L25>. etcd client won't compile without backport [Cleanup grpc client/v3/naming API #12675](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12675). 2. etcd `3.4` balancer is built on top of the removed API `balancer.ClientConn.UpdateBalancerState`.   I guess we have to check in [#12675](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12675) and [#12671](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12671) in release-3.4 in order to bump up gRPC-go version instead of forking the gRPC usage in another release branch to fix the CVE. |

| 1.

Is there a simple solution to just replace the removed `balancer.ClientConn.UpdateBalancerState`, instead of replacing the whole client side load balancer solution?

| Is there a simple solution to just replace the removed balancer.ClientConn.UpdateBalancerState, instead of replacing the whole client side load balancer solution? Note the grpc.Resolver is still an experimental package.  I need to investigate more to fully understand before adapting any code changes to the release.34 client based on the gRPC update since `v1.26.0`. ETA is end of this week.  Based on [#12124 (comment)](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12124#issuecomment-674368288) and [#12652](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12652), if we still maintain release-3.4 for a prolonged time, it will bite us again since it's forked. |

### swift-nio-http2 vulnerable to HTTP/2 Stream Cancellation Attack
[CVE-2023-44487](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487) /
[GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 5.3 / 10 (Medium)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http
[CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325) /
[GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity
Moderate

### swift-nio-http2 vulnerable to HTTP/2 Stream Cancellation Attack
[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487>) /
[[GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3")](<https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 5.3 / 10 (Medium)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http
[[CVE-2023-39325](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8 "CVE-2023-39325")](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325>) /

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

| etcd 3.4 balancer is built on top of the removed API `balancer.ClientConn.UpdateBalancerState`  This one seems easy to fix. We just need to replace the API with new type input.  Remove the original balancer plugin API, based on grpc.Balancer, and all related functionality.  From <https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.30.0> REF: [grpc/grpc-go#3180](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3180)  But for the balancer v2 API, [grpc/grpc-go#3431](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/pull/3431) has changed the `Balancer` API. I think we can't rewrite all the things to adapt the new API because it needs more test cases to ensure the functionality is working. We can just backport this [clientv3: Replace balancer with upstream grpc solution](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12671) and then bump the grpc.   ---   I try to backport the following pull requests in my local (without test code and testing) and then with their changes, we can bump grpc to v1.52.0 easier. However, each change needs more eyes to check it.   * clientv3: replace deprecated UpdateBalancerState/Picker API (Part of [update grpc-go version to v1.32.0 which has some breaking api changes #12398](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12398)) * Introduce grpc-1.30+ compatible client/v3/naming API.

| cc [@dfawley](https://github.com/dfawley) for opinion about upgrading grpc from 1.26 to 1.56.3 to fix [CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")  Was there something specific you wanted information about?  Generally speaking, that CVE isn't very important if you are only handling traffic from trusted clients. In other circumstances, we would highly recommend using a frontend for (D)DOS protection/etc, which could also be used to mitigate that CVE.  That said, 1.26 is very old, and I'd highly recommend upgrading versions on a far more frequent basis to get other bug and security fixes. |

The attacking client was using less than 75% of a single core and less than 150 MB of RAM. I could have trivially bumped the connection count number until etcd OOM'd. |

| How many data (K/V pairs) roughly are there in the etcd db file?  `0` I think, it is just a blank local server running via:  ``` etcd --advertise-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:PORT --data-dir DIR --listen-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:PORT --log-level=warn --cert-file CRT --key-file KEY --auto-tls=true --peer-auto-tls=true  ```  What's the HTTP2 request you submit to etcd?  Basically a `GET /v3/`. The client in unauthenticated. I know I could make the attack consume more memory by making a more well formed request that would take etcd longer to process. |

| Basically a `GET /v3/`. The client in unauthenticated.  Somehow I did not reproduce the issue you described. I used Jmeter to create 100 concurrent threads(users), and kept sending `GET /v3/` requests to `https://127.0.0.1:2379`. The CPU usage is around 300%, and the memory is around 70M. The client side was using about 200% CPU, and 1G memory. Note there is no any data in the etcd db.  Note there is 32G memory in total and 10 Cores in my local environment. There was still some idle CPU and unused memory during the test.  Would you mind share your detailed steps? |

| Would you mind share your detailed steps?  Unfortunately I cannot share exploit code. You can see if something like <https://github.com/secengjeff/rapidresetclient> helps to reproduce the issue better, but the approach you are taking is not sufficient.  It seems there isn't much we can do in etcd. Also Kubernetes only accesses etcd via gRPC instead of HTTP. K8s/kubelet only accesses the `/health`, `/livez` and `/readyz` over HTTP.  You can tear down unauthenticated http2 connections in the same way as [kubernetes/kubernetes#121120](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121120). This will allow you to keep http2 enabled without being at risk from DOS (the assumption being that an authenticated attacker will be more interested in reading the contents of etcd instead of DOS). |

| if something like <https://github.com/secengjeff/rapidresetclient> helps  Yes, it's much better now, but it still can't reproduce the situation you mentioned. It could increase the cpu usage to around 600%, and memory to 2GB+ with 100 concurrently connections, and each kept sending [HEADER](https://github.com/secengjeff/rapidresetclient/blob/e3730f12be9b2d26f587dfa31325f36d4e0d9960/main.go#L56) and [RST\_STREAM](https://github.com/secengjeff/rapidresetclient/blob/e3730f12be9b2d26f587dfa31325f36d4e0d9960/main.go#L71).  You can tear down unauthenticated http2 connections in the same way as [kubernetes/kubernetes#121120](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121120).  If I understood it correctly, K8s depends on the [Authorization header](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/c3eebb233d000ac2dbbd559725124a79bf40d0f0/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/authentication/request/bearertoken/bearertoken.go#L43) to identify unauthenticated connections. Note that K8s doesn't enable etcd's auth, and there is no `Authorization` header at all.  But etcd supports verify client's certificate. Please add flag `--client-cert-auth` when starting etcd. Please let me know if you still see the issue. |

| Yes, it's much better now, but it still can't reproduce the situation you mentioned.  A more robust exploit will work far better than that repo. You should assume the worse case is easily 10x-1000x what you see from that tool.  If I understood it correctly, K8s depends on the [Authorization header](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/c3eebb233d000ac2dbbd559725124a79bf40d0f0/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/authentication/request/bearertoken/bearertoken.go#L43) to identify unauthenticated connections.  No, Kube supports many different forms of auth, including cert based auth. But they are all resolved via the `http.Handler` which is why I injected the connection close logic at that layer.  Note that K8s doesn't enable etcd's auth, and there is no `Authorization` header at all.  Kube's usage of etcd isn't really relevant because etcd isn't exposed to external users in the Kube scenario.  But etcd supports verify client's certificate. Please add flag `--client-cert-auth` when starting etcd.  Yeah, this will prevent the issue because it stops the TLS connection from starting in the first place, so no http2 based attack can be attempted. This should be the documented recommendation to limit abuse of http2 for unauthenticated clients. You will have to decide if you want to do anything further to limit authenticated clients (and I do not know if there exist environments where setting `--client-cert-auth` is not practical). |

| A more robust exploit will work far better than that repo. You should assume the worse case is easily 10x-1000x what you see from that tool.  YES, it also ran out of the CPU & memory after removing the sleep between sending HEADER and RST\_STREAM. For anyone reference, this is my rafactored version [main.go](https://github.com/ahrtr/rapidresetclient/blob/main/main.go).  Starting etcd with command below,  ``` ./bin/etcd   --cert-file ./tests/fixtures/server2.crt --key-file ./tests/fixtures/server2.key.insecure --listen-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:2379 --advertise-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:2379  ```  Run the DoS test,  ``` ./rapidresetclient -delay 0 -con 30  ```  This should be the documented recommendation to limit abuse of http2 for unauthenticated clients.  Agreed. But it should not be a big problem. Usually etcd isn't a public service, In K8s use case, etcd is supposed to be only accessed by apiserver. In Non-K8s use case, etcd should run behind a loadbalancer. But anyway, agree to update doc.  and I do not know if there exist environments where setting --client-cert-auth is not practical  I suppose it (disabling client cert authentication) is only useful in dev or test environment. In TKG, it's enabled by default.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 5.3 / 10 (Medium)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity

#### Details
##### HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [[CVE-2023-39325](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8 "CVE-2023-39325")](<https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417>)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Details
##### HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Details
##### HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http
BIT-golang-2023-39325 /
[CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325) /
[GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8)
/ [GO-2023-2102](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2102)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 7.5 / 10 (High)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-39325](https://togithub.com/golang/go/issues/63417)

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[CVE-2023-44487](https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

[[CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3 "CVE-2023-44487")](<https://togithub.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3>)

## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Details
##### HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack
The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a
previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The
protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the
cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client
may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when
the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from
that TCP connection is processed.

Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies
on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately
after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start
working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled,
but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.

The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The
client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2
attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream
from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.

The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have
an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the
requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of
concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer
dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available
network bandwidth.

In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to
do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating
new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header
decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy
implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before
the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid
almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable
cost asymmetry between the server and the client.

Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This
advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo
advisory and their original conent follows.

##### swift-nio-http2 specific advisory
swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in
which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of
HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to
commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away,
including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This
can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward
progress.

swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies
reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of
stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients
violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows
clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while
constraining malicious actors.

### HTTP/2 rapid reset can cause excessive work in net/http

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately
resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the
total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of
simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency
limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit
(which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight
request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue
grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually
configuring HTTP/2.

The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per
HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the
golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams
setting and the ConfigureServer function.

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 7.5 / 10 (High)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
