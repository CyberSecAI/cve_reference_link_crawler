Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.21.3 and 1.20.10, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: rapid stream resets can cause excessive work

  A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and

  immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption.

  While the total number of requests is bounded to the

  http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress

  request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing

  one is still executing.

  HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing

  handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit. New requests

  arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client

  has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a

  handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server

  will terminate the connection.

  This issue is also fixed in [golang.org/x/net/http2](http://golang.org/x/net/http2) v0.17.0,

  for users manually configuring HTTP/2.

  The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests)

  per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the

  [golang.org/x/net/http2](http://golang.org/x/net/http2) package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams

  setting and the ConfigureServer function.

  This is CVE-2023-39325 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/63417>.

  This is also tracked by CVE-2023-44487.

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.21.3>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.21.3` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Dmitri, Michael, and Heschi for the Go team
