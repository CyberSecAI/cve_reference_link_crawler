Package        : netty
Version        : 1:4.1.33-1+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-44487
Debian Bug     : 1054234

A flaw was discovered in Netty,Â a Java NIO client/server socket framework. The
HTTP/2 protocol implementation allowed a denial of service (server resource
consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly.
This problem is also known as Rapid Reset Attack.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1:4.1.33-1+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your netty packages.

For the detailed security status of netty please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/netty>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
