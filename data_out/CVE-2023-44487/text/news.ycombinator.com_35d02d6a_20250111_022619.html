Because it breaks nearly every optimization that's been made to serve content efficiently over the last 25 years (sendfile, TSO, kTLS, etc), and requires that the server's CPU touch every byte of data multiple times (rather than never, for http/1).

HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 both have a limit on the number of simultaneous streams (requests) the sender may create. In HTTP/2, the sender may create a new stream immediately after sending a reset for an existing one. In HTTP/3, the receiver is responsible for extending the stream limit after a stream closes, so there is backpressure limiting how quickly the sender may create streams. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [insanitybit](user?id=insanitybit) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37835240)   | [root](#37831992) | [parent](#37833579) | [next](#37832423) [–]  Thanks.

In fact, they've always opened as many connections as they have resources for. But establishing a connection is extremely expensive compared to sending data on an already established channel. With this method they need to open far fewer connections for the same qps.

As each request is read (HEADERS and DATA frames) it is dispatched to an upstream service. When RST\_STREAM frames are read, the local state for the request is torn down and the upstream is notified that the request has been canceled. Rinse and repeat until the entire buffer is consumed. However this logic can be abused: when a malicious client started sending an enormous chain of requests and resets at the start of a connection, our servers would eagerly read them all and create stress on the upstream servers to the point of being unable to process any new incoming request. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fragmede](user?id=fragmede) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37832162)   | [parent](#37831236) | [next](#37831517) [–]  > which typically translates HTTP/2 to HTTP/1 Sticking with HTTP/2, or going with grpc/similar is also possible.

I think I might even have chatted with a coworker about it at the time, as he was implementing grpc (which uses HTTP/2) in Rust. It never occured to me that it could be used nefariously! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mgaunard](user?id=mgaunard) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37831897)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37831690) | [prev](#37833831) | [next](#37832720) [–]  Not everyone cares about Cloudflare, or even HTTP/2.

Is it? I imagine that implementations can do things like make creating/dropping a stream faster but how would an implementation flat out mitigate this? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mgaunard](user?id=mgaunard) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37834574)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37832201) | [next](#37831933) [–]  There is a maximum bandwidth at which data can arrive. Simply make sure you can always process it faster than the next packet can arrive, or implement proper mitigation in cases where you cannot. It's called programming under soft real-time constraints. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [insanitybit](user?id=insanitybit) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37835189)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37834574) | [next](#37840391) [–]  Well yeah, that's just how DoS kinda works with these sorts of vulns. "Be faster" is obviously a good strategy, but is it *viable* ? Is setting up and canceling a stream something that can be done at GB/s speeds? Maybe, idk. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mgaunard](user?id=mgaunard) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37835410)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37835189) | [next](#37840391) [–]  If you push arbitrary amount of pressure through a pipe that can only handle 1000 psi, you need a valve to release the excess pressure, or it will blow up. In the real world, pipes cannot put arbitrary pressure, so your constraint is more bounded than this. So if you receive 2000 psi but your pipes can only handle 1000, you just need a small component that can handle the 2000 to split the pressure in two, and you can handle it all without releasing any. The same applies to digital logic; it's always possible to build something such that you can guarantee processing within a bounded amount of time by optimizing and sizing the resources correctly. As the word "digital logic" suggests, these sorts of guarantees are more often applied when designing hardware than software, but they can apply to either. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [immibis](user?id=immibis) [on Oct 11, 2023](item?id=37840391)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37834574) | [prev](#37835189) | [next](#37836534) [–]  > Simply make sure you can always process it faster than the next packet can arrive This is pretty much impossible unless you make the client do a proof-of-work so they can't send requests very quickly. Okay, you *could* use a slow connection so that requests can't arrive very quickly, but then the DoS is upstream. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kiitos](user?id=kiitos) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37836534)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37834574) | [prev](#37840391) | [next](#37831933) [–]  HTTP/1 between a client-server pair incurs per-request overhead which is not present in HTTP/2. You can do more RPS with less CPU if you use HTTP/2. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mgaunard](user?id=mgaunard) [on Oct 12, 2023](item?id=37862889)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37836534) | [next](#37831933) [–]  You receive an Ethernet frame, you send an Ethernet frame.

Not as a novel thing, either. It's just one of several known vulnerabilities, suggesting they've known about this kind of thing for awhile. <https://pentestmag.com/good-bad-and-the-ugly-of-http-2/> I genuinely don't know if this is real a zero day, or if it's a known protocol vulnerability that nobody was mitigating. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fanf2](user?id=fanf2) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37837279)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37831517) | [prev](#37832720) | [next](#37831621) [–]  At least haproxy anticipated it [https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg44134.h...](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/msg44134.html) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sebstefan](user?id=sebstefan) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37831621)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37831517) | [prev](#37837279) | [next](#37831748) [–]  Hindsight is 20/20 | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [is\_true](user?id=is_true) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37831748)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37831517) | [prev](#37831621) | [next](#37833582) [–]  This is the reason you need a security researcher that is actively exploiting things. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jacquesm](user?id=jacquesm) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37832521)   | [root](#37831236) | [parent](#37831748) | [next](#37833582) [–]  It is but most companies see that as a cost without upside *until* they get compromised. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [badrabbit](user?id=badrabbit) [on Oct 10, 2023](item?id=37833582)   | [prev](#37831236) [–]  This sounds like an IP spoofing issue, it is an IP/layer3 problem where ISPs don't filter spoofed addresses from their users.
