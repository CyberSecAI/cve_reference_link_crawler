[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

In this release, we've fixed quite a few small bugs and annoyances, including HTTP/2 Rapid Reset which affected most HTTP/2 implementations.

*On a personal note (from [@mholt](https://github.com/mholt)): I recently became a dad! I want to thank our maintainers for helping in so many ways while I've been taking extra time for family. Francis, Matthew, Mohammed, and others -- including all the contributors below, and then some -- are to thank for shipping this release.*

## Highlights

* Updated <https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go> from v0.37.5 to v0.39.0, including many performance improvements. GSO and ECN are now enabled by default, but you may turn them off by setting the `QUIC_GO_DISABLE_GSO=true` and `QUIC_GO_DISABLE_ECN=true` environment variables respectively, if they cause you problems. See the [`quic-go` release notes](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases) for more details.
* The file server's `fileserver.BrowseTemplate` is now exported, so it may be customized by programs embedding Caddy. ([ed8bb13](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/commit/ed8bb13c5df7656647ca7fc1fd09237631a6767c))
* Environment variables loaded with `--envfile` no longer override existing variables. ([#5803](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5803))
* The `encode` handler now compresses `application/wasm*` content types by default. ([#5869](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5869))
* The `reverse_proxy` handler can now emit very detailed logs for debugging streaming and buffering. To enable it, set the `verbose_logs` subdirective, and set logging to `debug` level. Since the logs from this are very noisy, using `verbose_logs` to opt-in is necessary. We may ask you to enable this when asking for support! ([#5793](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5793))
* You can now check the version with `caddy -v`, like most other CLI utilities! ([#5874](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5874))

[Caddy is on feature freeze until after 2.8](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5704) so we can improve our testing situation. These patches have all been tried to ensure they work as intended, but if you notice any issues please report them!
