Version        : 9.0.31-1~deb10u10
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-44487

A regression was discovered in the Http2UpgradeHandler class of Tomcat 9
introduced by the patch to fix CVE-2023-44487 (Rapid Reset Attack). A wrong
value for the overheadcount variable forced HTTP2 connections to close early.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
9.0.31-1~deb10u10.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.
