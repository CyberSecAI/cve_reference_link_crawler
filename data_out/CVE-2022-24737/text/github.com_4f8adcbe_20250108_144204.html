* Fixed escaping of integer indexes with multiple backslashes in the nested JSON builder. ([#1285](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/1285))
* Fixed displaying of status code without a status message on non-`auto` themes. ([#1300](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/1300))
* Fixed redundant issuance of stdin detection warnings on some rare cases due to underlying implementation. ([#1303](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1303))
