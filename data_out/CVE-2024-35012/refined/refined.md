Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The idccms V1.35 application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. Specifically, the `/admin/infoType_deal.php` endpoint with the `mudi=add` parameter does not implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms such as unique tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to verify that the request originated from a legitimate user session within the application.
*   **Predictable Request:** The request parameters are predictable and can be easily crafted by an attacker.
*   **Vulnerable Endpoint**: `/admin/infoType_deal.php?mudi=add&nohrefStr=close` is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially add or modify data within the `infoType` section of the CMS without the user's knowledge or consent. The provided proof-of-concept (POC) creates new CMS info type.
*  The attacker can manipulate settings for the website.
*   This could lead to unauthorized changes in the website's content, structure, or functionality, potentially causing data corruption or denial of service.
*   In a more severe case, this could lead to a complete compromise of the application's integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website/Email:** An attacker could host a malicious website or send an email containing a crafted HTML form.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator user into visiting this malicious website or clicking on a link.
*   **Unsuspecting Admin User:** The attack relies on a victim administrator being logged into idccms at the time of the attack

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage accessible to the targeted admin user, or send a link via email that would redirect the victim user to the malicious webpage.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the idccms server or database.
*   The attacker does not need to know the valid admin password. They only need a valid authenticated admin session to be targeted.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerable URL is `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/infoType_deal.php?mudi=add&nohrefStr=close`.
*   The exploit uses a standard HTML form with several hidden fields including `dataTypeCN`, `dataType`, `dataMode`, and several other settings.
*   The attacker would need to modify the hidden fields in the form to suit their needs.
* The provided POC shows how to add a new info type.
