The provided content describes an information leak vulnerability in ThinkPHP version 5.0.24.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises when the `PATHINFO` is not configured and ThinkPHP receives a request with a `s` parameter where the module cannot be found. This results in the system leaking sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Leak: The application leaks sensitive server and framework information when an invalid module is requested.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The exploitation leads to the exposure of sensitive system information, such as server and request data and ThinkPHP constants. This information could be leveraged by an attacker to further compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests with a specific `s` parameter (e.g., `s=example`) to `index.php`, when the `PATHINFO` hasn't been configured.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges or position are needed.
