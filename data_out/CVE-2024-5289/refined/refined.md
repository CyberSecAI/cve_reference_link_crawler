Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5289

**Description:** The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP â€“ Page Builder Features plugin for WordPress, specifically affecting the Google Maps widget.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Google Maps widget parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when configuring the Google Maps widget, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored within the WordPress database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute when a user accesses the page, potentially leading to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Google Maps Widget Parameters:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the parameters of the Google Maps widget. Specifically the `customSnazzy` parameter is mentioned in the code and the Wordfence article, but the specific vulnerable parameters are not explicitly defined.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed whenever a user views the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor-level access.
- **Access to Edit Content:** The attacker needs the ability to edit pages or posts where the Google Maps widget can be added.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the plugin up to and including 3.2.42 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.2.43.
- **Sanitization Function:** The code includes a function called `sanitize_custom_snazzy_styles` and `sanitize_snazzy_item` which is intended to sanitize the custom Snazzy styles. However, this function appears to be either insufficient or not applied to all relevant inputs.
- The code extract shows the 'customSnazzy' attribute is being sanitized. However, the old version at tag 3.2.38 shows that this parameter is NOT being sanitized, meaning that the vulnerability was introduced in a later version.
- The code also has a function called `escape_for_js_variable` which is used to strip special characters from a string before being used in a JS variable, this is not related to the vulnerability.

The Wordfence article provides a good summary of the vulnerability and the affected versions. The trac browser provides the code from the vulnerable version and the fix.
