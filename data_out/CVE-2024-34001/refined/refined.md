- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The admin preset tool in Moodle lacked the necessary token to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially perform actions in the admin preset tool on behalf of a legitimate administrator without their knowledge.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a CSRF attack, where a malicious site or link tricks the victim's browser into sending a request to the vulnerable Moodle site while the victim is authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site.
