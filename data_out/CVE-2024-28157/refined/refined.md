Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28157:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The GitBucket Plugin fails to sanitize GitBucket URLs on build views.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts within the GitBucket URL, which are then executed in the context of other users viewing the build views.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary script execution:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser.
    *   **Data theft:** Attackers could steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   **Account takeover:** Attackers could potentially gain control of a user's Jenkins account.
    *   **Malicious actions:** Attackers could perform actions on behalf of a victim.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to configure jobs with a malicious GitBucket URL.
*   The XSS payload is then stored and triggered when a user views the build.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have the "Item/Configure" permission to modify the job configurations and introduce the malicious GitBucket URL.

**Additional Information**
*   The advisory notes that there is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
*   The affected versions of the plugin are 0.8 and earlier.
