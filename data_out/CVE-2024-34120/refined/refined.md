Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-34120:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as Stored XSS (CWE-79). This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application, which are then executed when other users access the affected content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
*   The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and user interaction (UI:R) by victim.
*   The scope is changed (S:C), meaning the vulnerability could impact other components of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application. This usually requires some form of authentication to the application. The attacker needs low privileged access (PR:L) to inject the malicious script.
*  The victim must interact with the malicious content by visiting the affected page (UI:R)
