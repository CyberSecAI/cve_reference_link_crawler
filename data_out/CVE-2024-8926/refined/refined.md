**CVE-2024-4577**

*   **Root Cause:** When using Apache and PHP-CGI on Windows, certain code page settings may cause Windows to use "Best-Fit" behavior, replacing characters in the command line given to Win32 API functions. The PHP CGI module misinterprets these altered characters as PHP options.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Argument Injection vulnerability, Improper handling of command-line arguments, specifically when PHP is used as a CGI module on Windows.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious PHP options, which may lead to:
    *   Revealing the source code of scripts.
    *   Executing arbitrary PHP code on the server.
    *   Potentially taking full control of the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks by sending specially crafted requests.
    *   Exploiting the character replacement behavior in Windows due to code page settings.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send requests to a PHP-CGI server on Windows.
    *   The server must be using a vulnerable PHP version.
    *   The system must have a code page setting that triggers the "Best-Fit" character replacement behavior.
