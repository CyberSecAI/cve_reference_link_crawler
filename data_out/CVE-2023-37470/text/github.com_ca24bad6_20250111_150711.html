# Remote code execution via user-supplied H2 connection strings

Critical

[salsakran](/salsakran)
published
GHSA-p7w3-9m58-rq83
Jul 29, 2023

## Package

Metabase OSS and Enterprise
(Metabase)

## Affected versions

<x.46.6.4,<x.45.4.3,<x.44.7.3,<x.43.7.3

## Patched versions

0.46.6.4,1.46.6.4,0.45.4.3.1,1.45.4.3,0.44.7.3,1.44.7.3,0.43.7.3,1.43.7.3

## Description

# What is the Vulnerability?

The core issue is that one of our supported data warehouses (an embedded in-memory database H2), exposes a number of ways for a connection string to include code that is then executed by the process running the embedded database. Because we allow users to connect to databases, this means that a user supplied string can be used to inject executable code.

We allow users to validate their connection string before adding a database (including on setup), and this validation API was the primary vector used as it can be called without validation.

We had previously sanitized user input to remove the `init` command which allowed code execution. In a string of one week, we were informed of three successive vulnerabilities related to the H2 connection string handling by independent security researchers of how to effect this. We fixed each of these in turn.

# Impact

The vulnerability could potentially allow remote code execution on your Metabase server.

# Patches

We previously notified our users of the original vulnerability, but two subsequent attack vectors were discovered after we patched the original one. We subsequently patched each of the found vulnerabilities.

Due to the variety of these attacks and the lack of usage of this database driver, we are removing the ability of users to add H2 databases entirely. We believe that continuing to apply user input sanitation bandaids on top of an insecure core problem is irresponsible and are removing this functionality from our application.

If you have an existing connection to an H2 database, you'll still be able to connect to that database. But we strongly encourage you to migrate your data from H2 to another database.

# Workarounds

If for some reason you cannot upgrade immediately, you can block these vulnerabilities at the network level by blocking the following endpoints until you are able to upgrade.

`POST /api/database`

`PUT /api/database/:id`

`POST /api/setup/validate`

Note that blocking these endpoints will prevent people from adding new database connections to Metabase.

Note also that these are `PUT` and `POST` endpoints. You should still allow `GET` requests to these endpoints. The `GET` requests aren’t relevant to the vulnerability, and Metabase will stop working if you block them.

If you are using H2 as a file-based database, we recommend you migrate to SQLite.

# How to know if you have been exploited

Search in your logs (Metabase logs or load balancer/reverse-proxy logs) for any API call to /api/setup/validate that returned a status code of 400. That endpoint should be called only once in the lifetime of your Metabase instance, so there shouldn't be any other calls after that. If you see that the endpoint has been called at any other time, you should consider that you have been exploited and you need to take action immediately.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
