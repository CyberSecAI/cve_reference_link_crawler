# Observable Timing Discrepancy in github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/extension/bearertokenauthextension

Moderate

## Package

gomod

github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/extension/bearertokenauthextension
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 0.80.0, < 0.107.0

## Patched versions

0.107.0

## Description

### Summary

The bearertokenauth extension's server authenticator performs a simple, non-constant time string comparison of the received & configured bearer tokens.

### Details

[opentelemetry-collector-contrib/extension/bearertokenauthextension/bearertokenauth.go](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/9128a9258fe1fee36f198f97b1e3371fc7b77a93/extension/bearertokenauthextension/bearertokenauth.go#L189-L196)

Lines 189 to 196
in
[9128a92](/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/commit/9128a9258fe1fee36f198f97b1e3371fc7b77a93)

|  | token := auth[0] |
| --- | --- |
|  | expect := b.tokenString |
|  | if len(b.scheme) != 0 { |
|  | expect = fmt.Sprintf("%s %s", b.scheme, expect) |
|  | } |
|  | if expect != token { |
|  | return ctx, fmt.Errorf("scheme or token does not match: %s", token) |
|  | } |

For background on the type of vulnerability, see <https://ropesec.com/articles/timing-attacks/>.

### Impact

This impacts anyone using the `bearertokenauth` server authenticator. Malicious clients with network access to the collector may perform a timing attack against a collector with this authenticator to guess the configured token, by iteratively sending tokens and comparing the response time. This would allow an attacker to introduce fabricated or bad data into the collector's telemetry pipeline.

### Fix

The observable timing vulnerability was fixed by [@axw](https://github.com/axw) in v0.107.0 (PR [#34516](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/34516)) by using constant-time comparison.

### Workarounds

* upgrade to v0.107.0 or above, or, if you're unable to upgrade at this time,
* don't expose the receiver using `bearertokenauth` to network segments accessible by potential attackers, or
* change the receiver to use a different authentication extension instead, or
* disable the receiver relying on `bearertokenauth`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
