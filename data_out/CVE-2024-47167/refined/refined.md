- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `async_save_url_to_cache` function in Gradio allows attackers to force the Gradio server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This is due to insufficient validation of URLs in the `/queue/join` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can target internal servers or services within a local network, potentially exfiltrating data or causing unwanted internal requests. Additionally, the content from these URLs is stored locally, making it easier for attackers to upload potentially malicious files to the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs via the `/queue/join` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/queue/join` endpoint with user-controlled URLs.
