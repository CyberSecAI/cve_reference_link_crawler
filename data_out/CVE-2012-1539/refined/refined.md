{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2012-1539",
      "root_cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory.",
      "vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer accesses a CTreePos object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution within the context of the current user. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially taking complete control of the system if the user has administrative privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker can host a specially crafted website or embed a malicious ActiveX control in an application or document that is designed to exploit the vulnerability when a user views it through Internet Explorer. Compromised websites and websites hosting user-provided content or ads can also be used to distribute the exploit.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website, click a link, or open an attachment to trigger the exploit."
    }
  ],
  "Workarounds": [
   {
      "Workaround": "Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to 'High' to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones",
      "Impact": "May cause some websites to work incorrectly. Adding trusted sites to the Trusted sites zone can mitigate this."
    },
    {
      "Workaround":"Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone",
      "Impact": "Disabling Active Scripting may cause some websites to work incorrectly. Adding trusted sites to the Trusted sites zone can mitigate this. The user will be prompted frequently when this setting is enabled."
    }
  ],
  "Mitigations": [
   {
    "mitigation": "By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario."
   },
   {
        "mitigation":"By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability"
    }
