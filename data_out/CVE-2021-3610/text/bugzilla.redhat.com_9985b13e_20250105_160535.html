| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1973689#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-06-18 13:45:08 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in ImageMagick in ReadTIFFImage() in coders/tiff.c because of an incorrect setting of the pixel array size which can lead to crash and segmentation fault. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.0-0 and 7.0.11-14.  Reference and upstream patch: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/930ff0d1a9bc42925a7856e9ea53f5fc9f318bf3>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1973689#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-06-18 13:45:51 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 1973691](show_bug.cgi?id=1973691 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3610 ImageMagick: heap-based buffer overflow in ReadTIFFImage() in coders/tiff.c [epel-8]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1973692](show_bug.cgi?id=1973692 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2021-3610 ImageMagick: heap-based buffer overflow in ReadTIFFImage() in coders/tiff.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1973689#c2)  Todd Cullum    2021-06-21 21:40:41 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  ImageMagick's ReadTIFFImage() function in coders/tiff.c assigned a size (`extent`) used to allocate memory via AcquireQuantumMemory()[1]. `extent` was calculated improperly and was too small, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read subsequently such as when converting an image. The upstream patch calculates `extent` to be a larger value in order to avoid this.  1. <https://imagemagick.org/api/MagickCore/memory_8c.html#a417a408aa35c9f385d31d2e40eed4b27>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1973689#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-21 22:40:25 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3610>   ``` |  |
