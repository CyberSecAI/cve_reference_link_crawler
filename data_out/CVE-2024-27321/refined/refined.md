### Summary
This document describes a vulnerability, CVE-2024-27321, found in the `MLCTaskValidate` class of the `autolabel` library. The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution through the use of the `eval` function.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability lies in the `validate` function of the `MLCTaskValidate` class within the `autolabel/src/autolabel/dataset/validation.py` file. The function uses the `eval` function to process the provided values of the label column, without sanitizing or validating them. If the input starts with '[' and ends with ']', the `eval` function is used on the value, resulting in arbitrary code execution if the input contains malicious code.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Eval Injection (CWE-95):** The use of the `eval` function on user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation allows for the execution of arbitrary Python code.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the victim's machine.
- **Potential for full system compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain control over the system by leveraging the ability to run arbitrary code.

### Attack vectors
- **Malicious CSV file:** The attacker crafts a malicious CSV file, where the label column contains code wrapped in "[]" brackets that will be executed by the `eval` function.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must then induce the victim to load the malicious CSV file using Autolabel.
- **Specific Configuration:** The victim must load the malicious file with the 'validate' parameter set to True and by using the specified configuration for a multilabel classification task.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a CSV file to a user of the Autolabel library.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, but the victim must load the malicious data with the `validate` option turned on.
