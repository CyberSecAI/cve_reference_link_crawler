Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improperly designed Finite State Machines (FSMs) within the hardware logic of certain Intel processors.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the FSM implementation within the processor hardware. The FSM is not handling state transitions properly.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition, where the affected system becomes unavailable.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have privileged user access to the affected system. The attack requires a high level of access (PR:H). The attack is of low complexity (AC:H)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
*   The document lists several generations of Intel Core and Xeon processors as affected.
*   Intel recommends applying the latest firmware updates provided by system manufacturers to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered internally by Intel employees.
