The provided content describes a fix for a memory leak in the Linux kernel's rxrpc module. This content relates to CVE-2021-47539 since it fixes a memory leak vulnerability in the rxrpc module.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `rxrpc_look_up_bundle` function in `net/rxrpc/conn_client.c` was freeing a bundle candidate using `kfree()` before calling `rxrpc_put_peer()`. This resulted in a memory leak because the bundle held a reference to `rxrpc_peer`, which was not released before the bundle was freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The `rxrpc_peer` reference was not properly released leading to memory leaks when a bundle candidate was not used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeated triggering of the vulnerable code path could lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network traffic: Triggering the creation of new rxrpc bundles through network communication will cause the leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: An attacker would need to send specific network packets that trigger the vulnerable code path to cause a leak.

The fix addresses the leak by introducing the `rxrpc_free_bundle` function, which first calls `rxrpc_put_peer()` and then frees the bundle with `kfree()`. This ensures that the `rxrpc_peer` reference is always released before the associated bundle is freed, preventing the memory leak.
