Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14680:

**1. Content Verification:**

   - The provided content from multiple sources, including Ubuntu, Oracle, Gentoo, and NetApp, all mention CVE-2020-14680 as a vulnerability related to MySQL.  Therefore, this content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause, as stated in the Oracle advisory and the Gentoo advisory, lies within the MySQL server's **optimizer**. The Gentoo advisory indicates it's one of multiple vulnerabilities.
   - The Oracle risk matrix identifies it as "Server: Optimizer".

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   -  The vulnerability is related to the server's component that handles query optimization, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior during query execution.
   - Specifically mentioned is a "MySQL Protocol" exposure, suggesting a weakness in how the optimizer handles certain requests.
   - The NetApp advisory states the vulnerability is related to versions of MySQL prior to 5.6.48, 5.7.30 and 8.0.20.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Data Integrity:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to cause incorrect results to be returned for queries.
   - **Availability:** May result in a hang or frequent crash, causing a partial or complete Denial of Service (DoS) of the MySQL server.
   - The Oracle risk matrix indicates an impact on "Availability" but not on "Confidentiality" or "Integrity".
   - The Gentoo advisory highlights that exploitation could lead to a denial of service.
  - The NetApp advisory mentions unauthorized access and read or modification of accessible data, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the other content for this CVE.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector is over the network, exploiting the "MySQL Protocol".
   - The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication. This means the attacker must have some valid credentials to connect to the MySQL Server.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - An attacker must have network access to the MySQL server.
   - The attacker needs to have valid credentials to connect to the MySQL server (e.g. a valid user account with required privileges).
   -  No specific privileges are described for this specific CVE, which likely means that a standard database user account may be used for exploitation if it sends queries that trigger the vulnerability.

**Summary of relevant details:**

*   **Root Cause:** MySQL Server Optimizer component flaw.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of specific queries by the optimizer.
*   **Impact:** Potential data corruption due to incorrect query optimization and possible denial of service
*   **Attack Vector:** Network, using the MySQL Protocol.
*   **Attacker Requirements:** Network access and valid MySQL user account.
