Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient filtering of user-supplied input in the `orderBy` clause of SQL queries. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application directly uses user-provided input in the `orderBy` clause without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The application fails to implement strict whitelist filtering or any form of input validation on the `orderBy` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can write arbitrary files, which can lead to RCE.
- Data Leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database by manipulating the SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP API endpoint: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `http://api:30455/api/v1/hosts/command/search` endpoint.
- The `orderBy` parameter within the JSON payload is used to inject malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- They must have knowledge of the API structure.
- No specific authentication requirements are mentioned but typically access to the API is required for this exploit to function.

**Additional Details:**
- The proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject SQL using the `orderBy` parameter.
- By manipulating this parameter (e.g., changing the number), the attacker can determine the number of columns in the data table, further aiding in the attack.
- The provided images show the curl request and the injection within the `orderBy` parameter.
