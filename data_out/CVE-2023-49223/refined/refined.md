{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the presence of an exposed SSH private key within the firmware of Precor treadmill consoles, allowing unauthorized remote access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposed SSH private key",
      "Insecure storage of cryptographic keys",
       "Lack of proper access controls"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain root-level access to the treadmill console. With this access, they can execute commands, including a reboot command which will abruptly stop the treadmill belt posing a physical safety risk to the user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack using SSH protocol"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the private SSH key found in the firmware and knowledge of the target device's IP address. The attacker must be on the same network as the treadmill or have network access to the treadmill."
