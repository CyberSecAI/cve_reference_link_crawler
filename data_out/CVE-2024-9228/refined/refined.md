Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `add_query_arg` function within the WordPress plugin "Loggedin – Limit Active Logins". Specifically, the plugin uses this function to construct URLs without properly sanitizing or escaping user-controlled input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The plugin takes unsanitized input, which in this case is the `loggedin_rating` parameter added to the URL, and reflects it back in the page's HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the context of a vulnerable webpage.
- **User Compromise:** By tricking a user into clicking a specially crafted link, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Modifying the content of the webpage.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing the malicious script in the `loggedin_rating` parameter and trick a user into clicking it. This could be done through:
    - Phishing emails.
    - Social engineering.
    - Malicious advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker must trick a user into clicking on a malicious link to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the "Loggedin – Limit Active Logins" plugin up to and including 1.3.1.
- The vulnerable code is within the `review_notice` function, specifically at line 255 of the `class-loggedin-admin.php` file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the "leave a review" notice is present in the admin panel.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.3.2.
