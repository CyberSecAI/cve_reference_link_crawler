| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2029923#c0)  Alex    2021-12-07 15:07:54 UTC  ``` Another possible race with Unix domain socket garbage collection that can lead to read memory after free. Older more or less similar issue is the [CVE-2021-0920](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-0920) with the fix commit cbcf01128d0a ("af_unix: fix garbage collect vs MSG_PEEK"). This race happens if the file handler in the process of being closed, the close() could happen before fget(), and then garbage collector can get confused by seeing this situation of having seen a file not having any remaining external references and then seeing it being attached to an fd.  Reference and upstream patch: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=054aa8d439b9>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2029923#c13)  Sandro Bonazzola
