Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `ajax_set_default_card` function within the Gestpay for WooCommerce plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of proper nonce validation allows an attacker to forge a request that can be executed by an authenticated user without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can set the default card token for a user. This could be used in a variety of ways such as setting a malicious/attacker controlled card as the default and then intercepting payments.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker must trick a logged-in user (typically a site administrator) into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link, that triggers the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious link or embed the forged request in a web page that is viewed by a logged-in user.

**Additional Notes**

* The Wordfence article specifies that the vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 20221130.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 20240307.
* The provided code snippet from `class-gestpay-cards.php` shows the vulnerable function `ajax_set_default_card()` which has nonce verification on line 121, however it is not used to validate the token, which is being passed in the POST request and used to set the user meta on line 123.
