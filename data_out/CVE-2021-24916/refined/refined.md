- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Qubely plugin's `qubely_send_form_data` AJAX action lacks proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not require authentication to execute the `qubely_send_form_data` AJAX action. This lack of access control permits unauthenticated users to send arbitrary emails.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can send emails to arbitrary email addresses with arbitrary content, potentially leading to phishing attacks, spam campaigns, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the `qubely_send_form_data` AJAX action by making a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
