# Cyrus IMAP 3.10.0-rc1 Release Notes[](#cyrus-imap-3-10-0-rc1-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

## Major changes since the 3.8 series[](#major-changes-since-the-3-8-series "Permalink to this heading")

* URLs found in HTML `<a>`, `<area>` and `<img>` tags, as well as "alt"
  text in `<img>` tags, are now indexed for search and snippets
* [cyr\_expire(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/cyr_expire.html#std-cyrusman-cyr_expire-8) now supports non-day durations in the
  archive/delete/expire annotations
* [cyr\_expire(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/cyr_expire.html#std-cyrusman-cyr_expire-8) no longer supports fractional durations in command
  line arguments. Installations that passed fractional durations such as
  "1.5d" to any of the `-E`, `-X`, `-D`, or `-A` arguments must adapt
  these to only use integer durations such as "1d12h"
* [cyr\_expire(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/cyr_expire.html#std-cyrusman-cyr_expire-8) now supports the 'noexpire\_until' annotation to
  disable cyr\_expire per user
* JMAP calendar default alarms are now stored in a non-DAV mailbox annotation.
  See [Default alarms](../../../upgrade.html#upgrade-jmap-default-alarms) for upgrading instructions if you are
  already using the experimental JMAP Calendars API
* Removes support for parsing and generating bytecode for the deprecated
  denotify action and notify actions using the legacy (pre-[**RFC 5435**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5435.html)) syntax.
  Existing bytecode containing these actions will still be executed. Scripts
  that contain the deprecated denotify action should be rewritten to remove
  them. Scripts that contain notify actions using the legacy syntax should be
  rewritten to use the syntax in [**RFC 5435**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5435.html)
* Adds support for the "exp" and "nbf" JSON Web Token claims. Thanks Bruno
  Thomas
* Adds support for IMAP Version 4rev2 ([**RFC 9051**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9051.html))
* Adds support for IMAP NOTIFY ([**RFC 5465**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5465.html)). Only available if `idled` is
  running
* Refresh interval for APNS subscriptions to DAV resources is now configurable.
  See the `aps_expiry` [imapd.conf(5)](../../../../reference/manpages/configs/imapd.conf.html#std-cyrusman-imapd.conf-5) option
* Upgrade IMAP Quota support to [**RFC 9208**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9208.html). Sites running a Murder will be
  unable to set ANNOTATION-STORAGE or MAILBOX quotas (formerly known as
  X-ANNOTATION-STORAGE and X-NUM\_FOLDERS) in a mixed-version environment until
  frontends are upgraded. Upgraded frontends know how to negotiate with older
  backends.
* Adds support for IMAP REPLACE ([**RFC 8508**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8508.html))
* Adds support for IMAP UIDONLY extension ([draft-ietf-extra-imap-uidonly](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-extra-imap-uidonly))
* Adds experimental support for JMAP Contacts per upcoming IETF standards.
  Requires the not-yet-released
  [libicalvcard](https://github.com/libical/libical/pull/584)
* [squatter(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/squatter.html#std-cyrusman-squatter-8) now supports the "wait=y" [cyrus.conf(5)](../../../../reference/manpages/configs/cyrus.conf.html#std-cyrusman-cyrus.conf-5)
  option when started in rolling mode from the `DAEMON` section
* [master(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/master.html#std-cyrusman-master-8) now touches a ready file to indicate it is "ready for
  work". See [master.pid and master.ready files](../../../upgrade.html#upgrade-master-pid-ready-files)
* [master(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/master.html#std-cyrusman-master-8) now gets its pidfile name from the `master_pid_file`
  [imapd.conf(5)](../../../../reference/manpages/configs/imapd.conf.html#std-cyrusman-imapd.conf-5) option. See [master.pid and master.ready files](../../../upgrade.html#upgrade-master-pid-ready-files)
* Adds pcre2 support. Prefers pcre2 over pcre if both are available. See
  [PCRE2 support](../../../upgrade.html#upgrade-pcre2-support)
* The `proc` [cyr\_info(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/cyr_info.html#std-cyrusman-cyr_info-8) subcommand now also reports DAEMON and
  EVENTS processes
* JMAP CalendarEventNotification objects are now automatically pruned.
  The `jmap_max_calendareventnotifs` [imapd.conf(5)](../../../../reference/manpages/configs/imapd.conf.html#std-cyrusman-imapd.conf-5) option can be
  used to tune this behaviour
* Cyrus now requires libical >= 3.0.10 for HTTP support
* Sieve [current]date `:zone` parameter now accepts either a UTC offset or an
  IANA time zone ID
* Adds an `implicit_keep_target` Sieve action to change the target mailbox
  for an implicit keep
* [squatter(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/squatter.html#std-cyrusman-squatter-8) no longer holds a mailbox lock while extracting text
  from attachments
* IMAP `RENAME` command no longer emits non-standard per-folder updates. Use
  the new `XRENAME` command if you need this behaviour

## Storage changes[](#storage-changes "Permalink to this heading")

* None in 3.10. But if your upgrade is skipping over 3.6 and 3.8, please do
  not miss [3.6.0 Storage changes](../../3.6/x/3.6.0.html#relnotes-3-6-0-storage-changes)
  and [3.8.0 Storage changes](../../3.8/x/3.8.0.html#relnotes-3-8-0-storage-changes)

## Updates to default configuration[](#updates-to-default-configuration "Permalink to this heading")

The [cyr\_info(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/cyr_info.html#std-cyrusman-cyr_info-8) conf, conf-all and conf-default subcommands
accept an -s <version> argument to highlight [imapd.conf(5)](../../../../reference/manpages/configs/imapd.conf.html#std-cyrusman-imapd.conf-5)
options that are new or whose behaviour has changed since the specified
version. We recommend using this when evaluating a new Cyrus version to
check which configuration options you will need to examine and maybe set or
change during the process.

* The master pidfile name is now read from imapd.conf, and defaults
  to `{configdirectory}/master.pid`. If you have something that
  looks for this file, you should either update it to look in the new
  default location, or set `master_pid_file` in [imapd.conf(5)](../../../../reference/manpages/configs/imapd.conf.html#std-cyrusman-imapd.conf-5)
  to override the default. The `-p` option to [master(8)](../../../../reference/manpages/systemcommands/master.html#std-cyrusman-master-8)
  can still be used to override it

## Security fixes[](#security-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed [CVE-2024-34055](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-34055):
  Cyrus-IMAP through 3.8.2 and 3.10.0-beta2 allow authenticated attackers
  to cause unbounded memory allocation by sending many LITERALs in a
  single command.

  The IMAP protocol allows for command arguments to be LITERALs of
  negotiated length, and for these the server allocates memory to
  receive the content before instructing the client to proceed. The
  allocated memory is released when the whole command has been received
  and processed.

  The IMAP protocol has a number commands that specify an unlimited
  number of arguments, for example SEARCH. Each of these arguments can
  be a LITERAL, for which memory will be allocated and not released
  until the entire command has been received and processed. This can run
  a server out of memory, with varying consequences depending on the
  server's OOM policy.

  Discovered by Damian Poddebniak.

  Two limits, with corresponding [imapd.conf(5)](../../../../reference/manpages/configs/imapd.conf.html#std-cyrusman-imapd.conf-5) options, have
  been added to address this:

  + `maxargssize` (default: unlimited): limits the overall length of a
    single IMAP command. Deployments should configure this to a size that
    suits their system resources and client usage patterns
  + `maxliteral` (default: 128K): limits the length of individual IMAP
    LITERALs

  Connections sending commands that would exceed these limits will see the
  command fail, or the connection closed, depending on the specific context.
  The error message will contain the `[TOOBIG]` response code.

  These limits may be set small without affecting message uploads, as the
  APPEND command's message literal is limited by `maxmessagesize`, not by
  these new options.
