|  |  |  |
|  |  | Changes since 3.8.2 |
|  |  | =================== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Security fixes |
|  |  | -------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Fixed CVE-2024-34055\_: |
|  |  | Cyrus-IMAP through 3.8.2 and 3.10.0-beta2 allow authenticated attackers |
|  |  | to cause unbounded memory allocation by sending many LITERALs in a |
|  |  | single command. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The IMAP protocol allows for command arguments to be LITERALs of |
|  |  | negotiated length, and for these the server allocates memory to |
|  |  | receive the content before instructing the client to proceed. The |
|  |  | allocated memory is released when the whole command has been received |
|  |  | and processed. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The IMAP protocol has a number commands that specify an unlimited |
|  |  | number of arguments, for example SEARCH. Each of these arguments can |
|  |  | be a LITERAL, for which memory will be allocated and not released |
|  |  | until the entire command has been received and processed. This can run |
|  |  | a server out of memory, with varying consequences depending on the |
|  |  | server's OOM policy. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Discovered by Damian Poddebniak. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Two limits, with corresponding :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` options, have |
|  |  | been added to address this: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* ``maxargssize`` (default: unlimited): limits the overall length of a |
|  |  | single IMAP command. Deployments should configure this to a size that |
|  |  | suits their system resources and client usage patterns |
|  |  | \* ``maxliteral`` (default: 128K): limits the length of individual IMAP |
|  |  | LITERALs |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Connections sending commands that would exceed these limits will see the |
|  |  | command fail, or the connection closed, depending on the specific context. |
|  |  | The error message will contain the ``[TOOBIG]`` response code. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | These limits may be set small without affecting message uploads, as the |
|  |  | APPEND command's message literal is limited by ``maxmessagesize``, not by |
|  |  | these new options. |
|  |  |  |
