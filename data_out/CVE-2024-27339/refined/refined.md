- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can achieve exploitation by enticing a user to open a specially crafted malicious PDF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must create a malicious PDF file. The victim must open the malicious PDF.
