Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the direct use of user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) within an SQL query in the `manage_user.php` file without any sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation and the direct concatenation of the `$id` parameter into the SQL query.
*   The provided code snippet demonstrates the vulnerability:
    ```php
    $user = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM users where id =".$_GET['id']);
    ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database (including user credentials).
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
    *   Potentially compromise the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the `id` parameter in the `manage_user.php` URL. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the `manage_user.php` page.
*   No prior authentication is required for this attack, as demonstrated in the proof of concept.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a proof of concept using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable application is identified as "Campcodes Online Laundry Management System V1.0".
*   The vulnerability was tested on a PHP, Apache, MySQL environment.
*   The GitHub content includes credentials for testing.
