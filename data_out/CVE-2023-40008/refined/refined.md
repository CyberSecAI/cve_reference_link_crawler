{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Simple Org Chart Plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs unintended actions on their behalf.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into interacting with the malicious request. This requires no prior authentication on the attacker's part, and the attacker needs no direct access to the affected WordPress instance."
