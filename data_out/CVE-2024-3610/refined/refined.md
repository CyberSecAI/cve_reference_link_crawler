Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3610

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `wctg_easy_child_theme()` function in the WP Child Theme Generator plugin. This lack of authorization allows unauthenticated users to execute the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper authorization checks, enabling unauthenticated users to trigger actions that should be restricted to authorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Child Theme Creation/Activation:** An unauthenticated attacker can create and activate a blank child theme.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Activating a blank child theme can result in a "whitescreen" error, effectively causing a denial of service by making the site inaccessible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by unauthenticated attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication is required** to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker can trigger the vulnerable function directly without any prior login or authorization.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.1.1.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.1.2, which included changes to the `wp-custom-child/wp-custom-child.php` file where the nonce check was updated.
- The vulnerability is considered to be of medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.
