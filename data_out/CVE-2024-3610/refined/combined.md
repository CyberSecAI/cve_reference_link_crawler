### Description

The WP Child Theme Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wctg\_easy\_child\_theme() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create a blank child theme and activate it cause the site to whitescreen.
