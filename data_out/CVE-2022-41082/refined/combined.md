## Microsoft Exchange vulnerable to server-side request forgery and remote code execution.

#### Vulnerability Note VU#915563

Original Release Date: 2022-10-03 | Last Revised: 2022-11-10

---

### Overview

Microsoft Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2013 are vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack and remote code execution. An authenticated attacker can use the combination of these two vulnerabilities to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code on the target Exchange server.

### Description

Microsoft Exchange Server's  [Autodiscover service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/architecture/client-access/autodiscover?view=exchserver-2019) is a web service widely available to any Microsoft Exchange Web Services (EWS) client. Since Microsoft Exchange version 2016, the Autodiscover service has become an integral part of the Microsoft Exchange system, and it is no longer independently provided by a Client Access server. The Autodiscover service and a number of other privileged mailbox services are hosted on the default Internet Information Services server running on the Mailbox server.

Cybersecurity company GTSC [observed an abuse of the Autodiscover service in August of 2022](https://www.gteltsc.vn/blog/warning-new-attack-campaign-utilized-a-new-0day-rce-vulnerability-on-microsoft-exchange-server-12715.html) using a crafted URL SSRF attack, similar to the earlier [ProxyShell](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/proxyshell-vulnerabilities-and-your-exchange-server/ba-p/2684705) vulnerability reported in August 2021. The observed attack appears to have implemented [CVE-2022-41040](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41040) to gain privileged access and [CVE-2022-41082](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41082) to perform remote code execution via PowerShell. Microsoft Security Research Center has [acknowledged the vulnerability and provided guidance for mitigation](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/09/29/customer-guidance-for-reported-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-exchange-server/). The guidance highlights that Microsoft Exchange Online customers will be provided with detection and mitigation defenses automatically from Microsoft's managed Infrastructure, informing them of any attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities.

### Impact

An authenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attacks to escalate privileges and execute arbtirary PowerShell code on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers. As the attack is targeted against Microsoft Exchange Mailbox server, the attacker can potentially gain access to other resources via lateral movement into Exchange and Active Directory environments.

### Solution

#### Workaround guidance

Microsoft has provided guidance in their [recent blog post](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/09/29/customer-guidance-for-reported-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-exchange-server/) to address the issue. Note that Microsoft has updated their guidance for the Option 3 Step 6 with the URL filter to be *.\*autodiscover\.json.\*Powershell.\** (excluding the *@* symbol) instead of the earlier *.\*autodiscover\.json.\*\@.\*Powershell.\**. The recommended block pattern is a regular expression suggested by [Jang](https://twitter.com/testanull) to prevent known variants of the #ProxyNotShell attacks. Microsoft further updated their advisory on October 8th suggesting **Condition Input** should be changed from {URL} to {UrlDecode:{REQUEST\_URI}} to ensure all encoded variations are evaluated before being blocked.

#### Apply update when available

As of October 3, 2022, there is no patch available to mitigate this issue. It is recommended that Microsoft Exchange administrators stay on alert for any advisory or patch released by Microsoft. Note the latest security updates from Microsoft on [October 11th](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/released-october-2022-exchange-server-security-updates/ba-p/3646263) **do not** address the vulnerabilities highlighted here. Even with the workaround in place, many on-premise Microsoft Exchange instances remain at risk until Microsoft provides a patch and the patch has been applied.

On November 8th 2022, Microsoft has provided fixes as part of their Patch Tuesday rollout, see updated Microsoft's guidance at [CVE-2022-41082](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41082) and [CVE-2022-41040](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41040).

#### Third-party web application protection

Exchange Administrators who use third-party Web Application Firewall (WAF) products can implement the recommended URL filters and blocks as part of their WAF policy.

#### Other mitigations

Exchange Administrators can limit the outgoing connection from the Exchange Mailbox server using specific allowed list on an outgoing proxy to limit suspicious web requests.

[Microsoft has released patches](https://www.secpod.com/microsoft-patch-tuesdays-by-secpod-labs/) for 65 vulnerabilities in its Microsoft November Patch Tuesday of which 6 are actively exploited Zero-Day. Among the 6 Zero-day, CVE-2022-41091 vulnerability is publicly disclosed. Eleven of the 65 vulnerabilities fixed in this security update are classified as ‘Critical’ as they allow privilege elevation, spoofing, or remote code execution, and the rest as ‘Important’. Moreover, with the correct [patch management tool](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/), you can easily detect and remediate this instantly.

In Microsoft November Patch Tuesday the 6 Zero-Day vulnerabilities include Microsoft Exchange Server ([CVE-2022-41082](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41082), [CVE-2022-41040](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41040)), Windows CNG Key Isolation Service ([CVE-2022-41125](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41125)), Windows Print Spooler ([CVE-2022-41073](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41073)), Windows Scripting Languages ([CVE-2022-41128](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41128)), Windows Mark of the Web Security ([CVE-2022-41091](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41091)).

## Zero-day Vulnerabilities

[Microsoft](https://blogthetech.com/2024/02/link-microsoft-account-via-microsoft-com-link/) November Patch Tuesday 2022 fixed zero-day vulnerabilities like:

[CVE-2022-41082](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41082), [CVE-2022-41040](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41040) – **Microsoft Exchange Server** Remote Code Execution and Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability. An authenticated attacker could attempt to trigger malicious code in the context of the server’s account through a network call. These vulnerabilities were disclosed in late September by Vietnamese cybersecurity firm GTSC, who first spotted the flaws used in attacks. Thus, successfully exploiting the vulnerability could allow authenticated attackers to perform remote code execution with elevated privileges.

[CVE-2022-41125](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41125) – **Windows CNG Key Isolation Service** Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges.

Furthermore Microsoft November Patch Tuesday 2022 also covered:

[CVE-2022-41073](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41073) – **Windows Print Spooler** Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges.

[CVE-2022-41128](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41128) – **Windows Scripting Languages** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. The JScript9 scripting language, a component of the Scripting Language, is vulnerable to this flaw. The victim must interact with the attacker for it to succeed. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow attackers to perform remote code execution.

[CVE-2022-41091](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41091) – **Windows Mark of the Web Security** Feature Bypass Vulnerability. The vulnerability is being exploited in the wild and exploitation of the vulnerability is publicly available. A malicious actor could craft a file that could bypass MoTW “resulting in a limited loss of integrity and availability of security features such as Protected View.”

Therefore Microsoft November Patch Tuesday addressed the above vulnerabilities. [Patch Management Software](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) can prove to be of great use to prevent these attacks from occurring.
