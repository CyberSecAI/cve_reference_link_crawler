Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Soft Serve passing all environment variables provided by the client to git subprocesses. This includes environment variables like `LD_PRELOAD`, which can be used to control program execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsanitized environment variables: Soft Serve does not sanitize or restrict the environment variables passed to the git subprocesses, allowing attackers to manipulate them.
- `LD_PRELOAD` exploitation: The ability to set `LD_PRELOAD` allows attackers to inject malicious shared libraries into the git process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Soft Serve. This is achieved by crafting a malicious shared object and loading it via `LD_PRELOAD`.
- Full control of the Soft Serve server can be gained by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- Git SSH requests: The attack is carried out through specially crafted Git SSH requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User with commit access: The attacker needs to be a user who can commit files to a repository hosted by Soft Serve, this allows the attacker to upload malicious files using Git LFS.
- Network access to the Soft Serve server: The attacker needs network connectivity to the Soft Serve server to initiate SSH connections and send git commands.
