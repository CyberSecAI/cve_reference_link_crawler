{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the parsing of SKP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious SKP file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious SKP file. User interaction is required as the victim must open the malicious file."
