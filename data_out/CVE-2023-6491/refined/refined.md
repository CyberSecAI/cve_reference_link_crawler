Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient capability check within the `wpmtst_save_view_sticky` function in the Strong Testimonials plugin. Specifically, the plugin was using `current_user_can('edit_posts')` which allowed users with the "contributor" role and above to modify view data, instead of a more specific capability like  `strong_testimonials_views` which is intended for managing views.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization/Access Control:** The plugin incorrectly authorized users to modify view data, allowing users with "contributor" roles and higher to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
- **Insufficient Capability Check:**  The use of `current_user_can('edit_posts')` instead of a specific capability for managing testimonials views resulted in an access control bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers with "contributor" access or higher could modify favorite views within the plugin. This could lead to tampering with the plugin settings, potentially causing a disruption in the functionality of the plugin or a malicious display of content.
- The modification of a view could include changing which testimonials are displayed and the configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable function.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least "contributor" level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the WordPress site.
- **Contributor Role or Higher:** The attacker must have at least the "contributor" role.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in version 3.1.13 of the plugin by changing the capability check to `current_user_can('strong_testimonials_views')`.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium)
- The vulnerability was discovered by Rafshanzani Suhada.
