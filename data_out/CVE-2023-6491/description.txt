The Strong Testimonials plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to an improper capability check on the wpmtst_save_view_sticky function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to modify favorite views.
