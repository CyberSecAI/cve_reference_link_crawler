The provided content contains information about CVE-2024-37063.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the improper handling of HTML output generation within the `ydata-profiling` library. Specifically, the Jinja2 templating engine is initialized without enabling auto-escaping, which prevents the framework from automatically sanitizing user-provided data within HTML templates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of auto-escaping in the Jinja2 template initialization. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability is present when generating HTML reports.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the profile report. When a user opens the generated HTML report, the attacker's script will be executed within the user's browser context. This can lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to the user's browser data.
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the report.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves creating a dataset with malicious HTML code designed to execute arbitrary JavaScript when rendered by the Jinja2 template. The crafted dataset will be processed by the ydata-profiling library. When the generated HTML report is opened by a user, the injected script will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide input data to be processed by `ydata-profiling` to generate the report or supply their crafted report to a victim. The attack does require the victim to open the generated HTML report in a web browser.
