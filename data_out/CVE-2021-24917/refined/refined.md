Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `WPS Hide Login` plugin's flawed logic in handling redirects when a request is made to `/wp-admin/options.php`. The plugin attempts to hide the login page by redirecting to a custom URL. However, the plugin does not correctly validate the source of the request leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly check if a user is authenticated before redirecting to the custom login URL.
*   **Referer Header Bypass:** The plugin uses the `Referer` header for some level of validation.  However, this is insufficient, and a malicious actor can bypass this protection by setting an arbitrary value for the `Referer` header in their request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Login Page Exposure:** An attacker can bypass the custom login URL set by the plugin and obtain the secret login page, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the WordPress admin panel.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to `/wp-admin/options.php` with an arbitrary `Referer` header.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to perform this attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **No Prior Knowledge Required:** The attacker does not need to have any prior access or knowledge of the custom login URL.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves sending a request to `/wp-admin/options.php` with a custom `Referer` header, which triggers the plugin's redirect and reveals the custom login URL.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.9.1 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is classified as an "INCORRECT AUTHORISATION" issue.
*   It's mapped to OWASP Top 10 "A5: Broken Access Control" and CWE-863.
*   The CVSS score is 5.3 (medium).
