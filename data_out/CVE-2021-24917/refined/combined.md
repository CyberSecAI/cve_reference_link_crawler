  Hello together,

  if this plugin is used on a subdomain and if the main domain redirects to the subdomain the following occurs:

  For example with the following domain: sub.domain.com

  if domain.com redirects to sub.domain.com there is the following bypass:

  Entering the url domain.com and add /wp-admin/options.php then it redirects to sub.domain.com/changedloginurl and you see the login-url and could log in.

  I estimate this to be grave, so will there be a fix?

  Best regards!!
