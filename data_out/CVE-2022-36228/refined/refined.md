{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions where users can unconditionally add rights to use all nokelock products by using the MAC address.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure permissions leading to unauthorized access and control.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can add a lock using the MAC address, subsequently modify the smart lock's password after initial security verification, and gain control over the lock.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves utilizing the MAC address to gain unauthorized access.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the MAC address of the target lock to exploit this vulnerability."
