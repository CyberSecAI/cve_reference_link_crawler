Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-33373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that ConnectedIO devices running firmware version 2.1.0 and prior store passwords and credentials in clear text format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the storage of passwords and credentials without any encryption or hashing. This makes them easily readable if an attacker gains access to the device or its configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers can exfiltrate the cleartext credentials.
- **Device Impersonation:** With the stolen credentials, attackers can impersonate the affected devices, potentially leading to unauthorized access, manipulation, or disruption of connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves gaining access to the device's storage or configuration files where the credentials are stored. Specific means of access are not specified in the provided text, but could potentially include direct access to the device or accessing exposed administrative interfaces.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to access the deviceâ€™s files or gain access to the device through other means.
- No other specific capabilities are mentioned.
