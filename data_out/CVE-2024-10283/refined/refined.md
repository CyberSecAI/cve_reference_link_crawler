  "cve": "CVE-2024-10283",
  "description": "In Tenda RX9 Pro Firmware Vx.x.x.x firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability in the sub_4337EC function. This function accepts the list parameter from a POST request by Var variable and pass it to the sub_4335DC function.Within sub_4335DC, since the user has control over the input of list, the statement strcpy(v14, a1) leads to a buffer overflow.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `strcpy` function in `sub_4335DC` copies data from a user-controlled `list` parameter into a fixed-size buffer `v14` without proper bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint, with a specially crafted 'list' parameter."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device's web interface. This could potentially be done remotely if the device's web interface is exposed to the internet."
