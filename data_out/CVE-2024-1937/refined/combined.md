### Description

The Brizy – Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'update\_item' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.44. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to modify the content of arbitrary published posts, which includes the ability to insert malicious JavaScript.
