Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-27919:

**Root Cause:**
- Envoy's HTTP/2 codec does not reset a request when header map limits are exceeded. This allows an attacker to send a flood of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper handling of header map limits in the HTTP/2 codec.
- The Envoy HTTP/2 implementation does not terminate the stream when it receives a large number of continuation frames.
- Specifically, the absence of a reset mechanism upon exceeding header map limits, and the continued processing of frames even when those limits are exceeded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) via memory exhaustion. An attacker can cause the Envoy process to run out of memory by sending a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sends a sequence of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames without setting the END_HEADERS bit.
- These frames are sent from an untrusted HTTP/2 peer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 traffic to the vulnerable Envoy instance.
- No specific privileges are required, as the vulnerability is exploitable through normal network communication to a server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is a regression introduced in Envoy versions 1.29.0 and 1.29.1.
- Patched version is 1.29.2.
- Workarounds include downgrading to version 1.28.1 or earlier, or disabling the HTTP/2 protocol.
- The vulnerability is related to a broader issue affecting multiple HTTP/2 implementations (as detailed in CERT/CC VU#421644).
- CVE-2024-30255 is another CVE related to HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame attacks in Envoy, but is related to CPU exhaustion, not memory exhaustion (CVE-2024-27919).
