The provided content is related to the same vulnerability fix, specifically addressing a race condition in the USB Type-C Port Manager (TCPM) within the Linux kernel. The vulnerability occurs due to the potential expiration of hrtimers after the TCPM port's kthread_worker is destroyed, leading to a kernel panic. This issue is addressed by cancelling the relevant hrtimers upon unregistering the tcpm port.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition occurs when the `tcpm_unregister_port` function does not cancel the hrtimers `vdm_state_machine_timer` and `state_machine_timer` before the kthread_worker of the tcpm port is destroyed. This allows the hrtimer to expire and access freed resources resulting in a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: After the kthread worker is destroyed the hrtimer can still expire and access freed resources causing a kernel panic.
- Race condition: The hrtimer expiration and kthread destruction are not synchronized leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic: The system crashes due to the use-after-free condition when the hrtimer attempts to access freed memory.
- Denial of service: The system becomes unavailable, interrupting normal operations.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by unloading the TCPM module while the hrtimer is still pending.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to unload the TCPM module. This would typically require root or administrator access to the system.

The fix involves adding the following lines to `tcpm_unregister_port` function in `drivers/usb/typec/tcpm/tcpm.c`:
```c
hrtimer_cancel(&port->vdm_state_machine_timer);
hrtimer_cancel(&port->state_machine_timer);
```

This ensures that the hrtimers are cancelled before the tcpm port is unregistered, preventing the race condition and subsequent kernel panic.
