- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper verification of the source IP address during GlobalProtect gateway connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The GlobalProtect gateway does not properly verify the source IP address of the connecting client, allowing connections from unauthorized IPs. This is related to CWE-940, Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user with stolen credentials can establish a VPN connection from an unauthorized IP address, potentially bypassing network access controls.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, where an attacker attempts a VPN connection using stolen credentials from a non-authorized IP address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs stolen credentials for a valid user. The attacker does not need to be on the local network to exploit.
