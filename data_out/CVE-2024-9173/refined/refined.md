**Attack Vectors:**
- **SVG File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Author" level access or higher. This allows them to upload files.
- **Access to WordPress Admin Interface:** The attacker must be able to log in to the WordPress administrative dashboard.

**Additional Details:**

- There is no known patch available for this vulnerability.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download due to the security issue.
