Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file type validation in the file upload functionality of the `guest-entries` package. Specifically, it was possible to upload PHP files through the file upload feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allowed the upload of files with executable extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.php3`, `.php4`, `.php5`, `.phtml`).
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There wasn't adequate validation of file extensions to prevent the uploading of malicious file types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and accessing a malicious PHP file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload Feature:** The primary attack vector is the file upload feature provided by the `guest-entries` package.
*   **Web Request:** The attacker would submit a malicious PHP file through the designated upload mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the file upload functionality of the guest entries package
*  No authentication was mentioned as a requirement for the file upload in the text.
* The attacker could be unauthenticated, or authenticated if the file upload functionality was behind an authentication wall.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to v3.1.3 of the `duncanmcclean/guest-entries` package.
*   The fix implemented in commit `a8e17b4413bfbbc337a887761a6c858ef1ddb4da` adds a check to prevent the upload of files with the specified PHP extensions.
*   The fix involves checking the file extension of each uploaded file and throwing a `ValidationException` if a disallowed extension is found.
* The fix also includes tests that verify that PHP files cannot be uploaded, and that normal file uploads work as intended.
