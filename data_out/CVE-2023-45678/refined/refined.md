      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by an out-of-bounds write in the `start_decoder` function of stb_vorbis. This occurs because of an off-by-one error when accessing the `submap_floor` and `submap_residue` arrays. The `submaps` variable can be set to a maximum of 16, but the size of `submap_floor` and `submap_residue` arrays is 15.",
