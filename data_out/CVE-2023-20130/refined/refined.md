- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of affected systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform arbitrary actions on the affected system with the privileges of a targeted user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker persuades a user of the interface to follow a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a user to click it; this does not require any prior access to the system.
