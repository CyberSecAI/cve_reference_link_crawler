For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pi-epnm-infodis-eRPWAXLe>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, CVE-2023-20127 affected Cisco Prime Infrastructure.  At the time of publication, CVE-2023-20129, CVE-2023-20130, and CVE-2023-20131 affected Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20127: Cisco Prime Infrastructure Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view privileged information about network devices that are managed by an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of sensitive data in the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the interface as a low-privileged user and taking certain actions within the configuration pages of the network devices. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information about the network devices that is stored on the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwc25461](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc25461)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20127Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2023-20131: Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM XSS Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface of an affected system.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwc76734](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc76734), [CSCwd28312](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd28312), [CSCwd69561](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd69561)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20131Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2023-20129: Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view certain files from the underlying operating system.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the underlying operating system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwc25461](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc25461), [CSCwd28312](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd28312)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20129Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.9CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2023-20130: Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM CSRF Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwc51948](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc51948), [CSCwd28312](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd28312)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20130Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
