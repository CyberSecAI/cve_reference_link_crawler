- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The goTenna Pro App has a weakness that allows for injection of custom messages with arbitrary GID and Callsign due to weak authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Weak authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary messages within an existing goTenna mesh network. This could lead to disruption of communication, misinformation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can use a software-defined radio to inject messages into the goTenna mesh network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within radio range of a goTenna mesh network and have the ability to send custom RF signals with a software-defined radio. The vulnerability can be exploited if the network is unencrypted or if the encryption is already compromised.
