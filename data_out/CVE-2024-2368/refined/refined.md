Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `duplicateForm()` function within the Mollie Forms WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF. The absence of proper nonce validation allows an attacker to forge requests that can be executed by an authenticated user. Specifically, the `duplicateForm()` function lacks sufficient protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Post Duplication:** A successful CSRF attack can lead to the duplication of forms, which may cause unwanted behavior, clutter, or disruption of the website's intended functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged Request:** Attackers can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in administrator (e.g., via a link), will execute the vulnerable function on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing some other action that triggers the forged request.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable function:** The attacker must know the vulnerable function name and parameters in order to construct a valid attack request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Mollie Forms plugin versions up to and including 2.6.13.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.14 by adding nonce verification to the `duplicateForm()` function.
- The patch also included adding nonce verification to the export registrations function.
- The provided diff shows changes to the `Admin.php` file, which now includes the `wp_verify_nonce` check for both exporting and duplicating forms.
