# BE-2022-0019: FBX File Parsing Out-of-bounds Read Vulnerabilities and Head Overflow in MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications

**Bentley ID:** BE-2022-0019

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-42900

**Severity:** 7.8

**CVSS v3.1:** AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Publication date:** 2022-10-12

**Revision date:** 2022-10-12

**Summary**MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications may be affected by out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities when opening maliciously crafted FBX files. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to information disclosure and code execution.

**Details**Using an affected version of MicroStation or MicroStation-based application to open a FBX file containing maliciously crafted data can force an out-of-bounds read or force execution of arbitrary code. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities within the parsing of FBX files could enable an attacker to read information or execute code in the context of the current process.

**Affected Versions**

| **Applications** | **Affected Versions** | **Mitigated Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MicroStation | 10.17.0.\* and prior versions | 10.17.01.58\* and more recent |
| Bentley View | 10.17.0.\* and prior versions | 10.17.01.19 and more recent |

**Recommended Mitigations**Bentley recommends updating to the latest versions of MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications. As a general best practice, it is also recommended to only open FBX files coming from trusted sources.

**Acknowledgement**Thanks to Michael DePlante (@izobashi) of Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative
