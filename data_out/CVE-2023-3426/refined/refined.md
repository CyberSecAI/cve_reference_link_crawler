- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The organization selector in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP does not check user permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Missing permission checks on the organization selector. This allows unauthorized access to organization names.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can obtain a list of all organizations, which they normally wouldn't have access to. This information disclosure could potentially be used in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user. They don't need special privileges, just a valid login.
