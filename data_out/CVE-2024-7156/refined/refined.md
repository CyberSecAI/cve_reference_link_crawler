Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of access control in the `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` script of the TOTOLINK A3700R router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` script can be accessed without authentication.
- **Information Disclosure:** The script allows downloading of the `apmib` configuration file (Config--xxxxxxxx.dat) without proper authorization.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The `apmib` configuration file contains sensitive information, including usernames and passwords, which can be extracted after decoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to the router's configuration, including administrative credentials (username/password).
- This access could allow the attacker to take control of the device, change its settings, and potentially use it in further attacks, including network access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a direct HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` endpoint of the router's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable TOTOLINK A3700R router. This could be from within the local network, or if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet, remotely.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `apmib` configuration file is named `Config--xxxxxxxx.dat` where `xxxxxxxx` is a variable string.
- The vulnerability is present in version A3700R V9.1.2u.5822\_B20200513.
