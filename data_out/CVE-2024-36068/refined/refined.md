Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A vulnerability exists in an internal service of Rubrik's CDM (Cloud Data Management) platform due to a weak authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Authentication:** The vulnerability stems from an internal service within the CDM platform that has a weak authentication process. This allows for unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the CDM platform, allowing attackers to perform any action they choose on the system.
*   **Arbitrary Operations:** Attackers can perform arbitrary operations on the system, meaning they can potentially manipulate or compromise the platform.
*   **Data Breach:** Although not explicitly mentioned, arbitrary code execution could lead to unauthorized access or compromise of the backup data managed by the CDM platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the local network where the CDM platform is deployed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Sophisticated Understanding:** The attacker requires a sophisticated understanding of the vulnerability to carry out the exploit successfully.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable CDM platform.
*   **Technical Expertise:** The attacker requires advanced technical knowledge to understand and exploit the weak authentication vulnerability.
*   **Sophistication:** The advisory emphasizes a "sophisticated attacker" which means an attacker capable of performing complex exploits rather than a script kiddie.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing, not external reports.
*   Rubrik is not aware of any public exploits or customers impacted by this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
*   The advisory withholds specific details of the vulnerability to prevent potential exploitation.
*   The affected platforms include all physical and virtual CDM platforms prior to the specified patch versions. Cloud platforms are not affected.

**Remediation:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by upgrading CDM to one of the following versions (or later):
    *   9.1.2-p1
    *   9.0.3-p6
    *   8.1.3-p12
*   MSP environments using Envoy with VMware workloads need to upgrade to 9.1.2-p2, 9.0.3-p7, or 8.1.3-p13 (or later).
*   Upgrades can be performed through the Rubrik Security Cloud (RSC) interface.
