# [Bug] Users can view audit events from other members

### Summary

Users without expected permission can search for and view audit events from other users using the UI.

As noted in our feature [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_events.html#group-events), events by other members should only be visible:

1. On **groups** for `owners` and `admins`.
2. On **projects** for `maintainers` and above.

Users with lower access should only be able to view their own events.

### Additional notes

* Users have to be logged in to view the audit events on a group / project.
* I could not replicate this bug on the [audit events API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/audit_events.html#group-audit-events).

### Steps to reproduce

1. Log in with user\_A and create an audit event (create / import a project / change approval rules).
2. Log in with user\_B that has a `Developer` role and view the audit events page for the same group / project where the event was created:
   * `https://staging.gitlab.com/groups/[GROUP]/-/audit_events`
3. Append user\_A's username to the URL and hit enter:
   * `?entity_type=Author&author_username=[USERNAME]`
4. You should now see user\_A's audit events.

### Example Project

<https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/audit_events?entity_type=Author&author_username=employment-bot>

Most users do not have `owner` access on GitLab-org so the above should not show results.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Group and project members can view the audit events from all members.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Group and project members should only be able to view audit events generated by themselves, unless:

1. They have `owner` and `admin` role in a group.
2. They have `maintainer` or above role in a project.

### Output of checks

#### Results of GitLab environment info

Expand for output related to GitLab environment info
```

(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:
`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)

(For installations from source run and paste the output of:
`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)

```
#### Results of GitLab application Check

Expand for output related to the GitLab application check
```

(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true)

(For installations from source run and paste the output of:
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true)

(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)

```
### Possible fixes

I suspect there's an issue or lack of permission checking on the `AuditEventsController`.
