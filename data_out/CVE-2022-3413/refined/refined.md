Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checking in the `AuditEventsController` within GitLab. Specifically, the UI allows users with lower access roles (like "Developer") to view audit events of other users by manipulating the URL parameters, which should only be available to users with specific permissions (e.g., "Owner," "Admin," "Maintainer").

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce authorization rules within the `AuditEventsController` when handling requests through the UI. While the API seems to correctly enforce these restrictions, the UI permits access to unauthorized audit events through URL parameter manipulation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability results in unintended information disclosure by allowing unauthorized users to view audit logs of other members.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Audit Logs:** Attackers with limited access can view the audit events of other users within a group or project.
*   **Potential for Sensitive Information Exposure:** Audit events can contain sensitive information about user activity, configuration changes, and project interactions. Exposure of this information could be detrimental depending on the data stored.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting specific URLs with query parameters (`?entity_type=Author&author_username=[USERNAME]`) to filter and view audit events of a specific user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a basic role (e.g. developer role) within a project or group in the GitLab instance.
*   **Knowledge of Username:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the username of the user whose audit events they wish to view.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in the UI, while the API seems to be unaffected. This suggests a discrepancy in permission checking between the UI and the API.
* The provided example demonstrates how the attacker can use a specific username via URL parameter to view the audit events for that user.
* The vulnerability can be exploited on group or project audit event pages.
* The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
