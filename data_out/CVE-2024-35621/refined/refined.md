- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in Markdown fields within the Formwork CMS. Specifically, the lack of sufficient sanitization allowed the injection of `<script>` tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to lack of input sanitization for Markdown fields.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the Formwork administration panel, and specifically, the ability to edit pages, could inject malicious `<script>` tags into Markdown fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, specifically the ability to edit pages in the Formwork CMS administration panel, and the user must interact with the malicious content (i.e., browse a page containing injected script).
