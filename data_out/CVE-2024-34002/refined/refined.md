  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Misconfigured shared hosting environments allow access to other users' content. A Moodle user with restore feedback module access and direct web server access outside the Moodle webroot can perform a local file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could include arbitrary local files on the server via a crafted feedback module backup.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by restoring a modified feedback module backup file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires a Moodle user account with restore feedback module permissions and direct access to the web server outside of the Moodle webroot. This is primarily a risk in shared hosting environments with misconfigurations."
