- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability exists in the `BASupSrvcUpdater.exe` application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is susceptible to a TOCTOU race condition, allowing an attacker to manipulate the process into performing arbitrary file deletions due to a lack of proper synchronization when accessing shared resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a local unprivileged attacker to gain SYSTEM level privileges by performing arbitrary file deletions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to create a pseudo-symlink at `C:\ProgramData\GetSupportService\_N-Central\PushUpdates` to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create pseudo-symlinks, along with knowledge of TOCTOU race condition attacks.
