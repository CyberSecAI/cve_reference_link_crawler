- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Custom Twitter Feeds (Tweets Widget) plugin for WordPress, versions 2.2.3 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions by exploiting the user's existing authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform actions they did not intend to execute, leading to potential unauthorized changes, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into performing actions through a crafted request, potentially by embedding malicious code in a link or a website they visit while logged into the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website with a crafted request that targets the vulnerable plugin. No prior authentication is required for the attacker to set up the malicious request.
