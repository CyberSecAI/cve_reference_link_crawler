| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in [drogon up to 1.8.1](?product.drogon). Affected by this issue is some unknown processing of the component *Session Hash Handler*. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a small space of random values vulnerability. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to [CWE-334](?vulnerability_cwe.213464 "Cwe"). The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks. Impacted is availability.

The weakness was shared 11/11/2022. The advisory is shared for download at [github.com](?advisory_url.213464). This vulnerability is handled as [CVE-2022-3959](?source_cve.213464 "Cve"). There are neither technical details nor an exploit publicly available. The MITRE ATT&CK project declares the attack technique as [T1600.001](?vulnerability_attck.213464 "Attck").

Upgrading to version 1.8.2 eliminates this vulnerability. The upgrade is hosted for download at [github.com](?countermeasure_upgrade_url.213464). Applying the patch c0d48da99f66aaada17bcd28b07741cac8697647 is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at [github.com](?countermeasure_patch_url.213464). The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.

The entries [VDB-180069](?id.180069), [VDB-193564](?id.193564), [VDB-233110](?id.233110) and [VDB-233111](?id.233111) are related to this item.

### @marty1885 **[marty1885](/marty1885)** commented [Nov 9, 2022](#issue-1442298431) • edited Loading

This patch randomizes the hash parameters for HTTP request and response classes per session. This avoids HashDoS attacks while not causing tremendous performance overhead.

Other approaches we considered includes

* `map` instead of `unordered_map`
* `unordered_map<map<string, string>>`
* cryptographically secure hashes for key
* etc..

But all methods above causes more performance loss then this. We will be making a new release very soon after this PR being merged in order for our users to avoid the vulnerability.

Also, this introduces an API break as the return type of `parameters()` is no longer `std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>()`. However in our survey (of the projects that the maintainers run). That API is rarely used and can be easily updated by using `auto` or updating the return type.

We'd like to attribute [@itrofimow](https://github.com/itrofimow) for discovering the issue

Sorry, something went wrong.
