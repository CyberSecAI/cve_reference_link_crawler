### @marty1885 **[marty1885](/marty1885)** commented [Nov 9, 2022](#issue-1442298431) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

This patch randomizes the hash parameters for HTTP request and response classes per session. This avoids HashDoS attacks while not causing tremendous performance overhead.

Other approaches we considered includes

* `map` instead of `unordered_map`
* `unordered_map<map<string, string>>`
* cryptographically secure hashes for key
* etc..

But all methods above causes more performance loss then this. We will be making a new release very soon after this PR being merged in order for our users to avoid the vulnerability.

Also, this introduces an API break as the return type of `parameters()` is no longer `std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>()`. However in our survey (of the projects that the maintainers run). That API is rarely used and can be easily updated by using `auto` or updating the return type.

We'd like to attribute [@itrofimow](https://github.com/itrofimow) for discovering the issue

Sorry, something went wrong.
