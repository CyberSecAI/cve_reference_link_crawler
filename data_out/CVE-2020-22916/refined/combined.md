## Introduction

XZ Utils are a complete C99 implementation of the .xz file format.
XZ Utils were originally written for POSIX systems
but have been ported to a few non-POSIX systems as well.

The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on
[LZMA SDK](https://7-zip.org/sdk.html)
but it has been modified significantly to be suitable for XZ Utils.

XZ Utils consist of several components:

* **liblzma** is a compression library with an API similar to that of zlib.
* **xz** is a command line tool with syntax similar to that of gzip.
* **xzdec** is a decompression-only tool smaller than the full-featured xz tool.
* A set of shell scripts (**xzgrep**, **xzdiff**, etc.) have been adapted
  from gzip to ease viewing, grepping, and comparing compressed files.

## Documentation

Man pages with keyword indexes:

* [xz(1)](man/xz.1.html)
* [xzgrep(1)](man/xzgrep.1.html)
* [xzdiff(1)](man/xzdiff.1.html) and xzcmp(1)
* [xzless(1)](man/xzless.1.html)
* [xzmore(1)](man/xzmore.1.html)
* [xzdec(1)](man/xzdec.1.html)
* [lzmainfo(1)](man/lzmainfo.1.html)

[liblzma API documentation](liblzma-api/files.html)
was generated using [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/).

## Security issues

### CVE-2024-47611: Argument injection on Windows

When built for native Windows (MinGW-w64 or MSVC),
the command line tools from XZ Utils 5.6.2 and older
have a command line argument injection vulnerability.
Command line tools built for Cygwin or MSYS2 are unaffected.
liblzma is unaffected.

If a command line contains Unicode characters (for example, filenames)
that don’t exist in the current legacy code page,
the characters are converted to similar-looking characters
with best-fit mapping.
Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII characters
that change the meaning of the command line,
which can be exploited with malicious filenames
to do argument injection or directory traversal attacks.

This issue was discovered by
Orange Tsai and splitline from DEVCORE Research Team.

XZ Utils 5.6.3 (and the backported commits in the v5.4 and v5.2 branches)
force the process code page to UTF-8.
This avoids best-fit mappings and thus fixes the issue.
However, forcing the process code page to UTF-8 is possible only
on Windows 10 version 1903 and later.
The command line tools remain vulnerable if used
on an old older version of Windows.

A related smaller issue remains:
Windows filenames may contain unpaired surrogates (invalid UTF-16).
These are converted to the replacement character U+FFFD
in the UTF-8 code page.
Thus, filenames with different unpaired surrogates appear identical and
aren’t distinguishable from filenames that contain
the actual replacement character U+FFFD.

Compatibility notes:

* UTF-8 is now the expected encoding of the file lists
  read using `--files` and `--files0` options
  when running on Windows 10 version 1903 or later.
* If building with a MinGW-w64 toolchain,
  it is recommended to use UCRT version instead of the old MSVCRT.
  With the UTF-8 code page,
  messages with non-ASCII characters are not shown properly with MSVCRT.

For more information about best-fit mapping vulnerabilities,
see the [WorstFit](https://worst.fit/) website.

### CVE-2024-3094: liblzma backdoor

XZ Utils 5.6.0 (2024-02-24) and 5.6.1 (2024-03-09) release tarballs
contain a backdoor that was inserted by a malicious co-maintainer.
It was
[discovered by Andres Freund](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4)
and made public on 2024-03-29.
The incident is known as
[CVE-2024-3094](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3094).

This is still being investigated.
See the [XZ Utils backdoor](../xz-backdoor/) page
for more information and also the
[XZ Utils review notes](../xz-backdoor/review.html).

### CVE-2022-1271: xzgrep filename handling

[CVE-2022-1271](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1271)
is also known as
[ZDI-CAN-16587](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-619/).

Malicious filenames can make **xzgrep** to write to arbitrary files
or (with a GNU sed extension) lead to arbitrary code execution.
A patch to fix it was made public on 2022-04-07.
The patch applies to 4.999.9beta, 5.0.0 to 5.2.5, 5.3.1alpha, and 5.3.2alpha.
Newer XZ Utils releases include an improved fix for the problem.

<xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch> — [signature](xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch.sig)

The vulnerability was discovered
by cleemy desu wayo working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.

### CVE-2020-22916: A bogus CVE

[CVE-2020-22916](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-22916) is bogus;
it’s not a security issue or a bug.

The report had
[a corrupt .lzma file](CVE-2020-22916-bogus.lzma)
which uses a tiny 256-byte dictionary.
So decompression needs very little memory.
The reporter claimed that decompressing it “could cause endless output”.

Both XZ Utils and the long-deprecated LZMA Utils
produce 114,881,179 bytes of output from the file before reporting an error.
This is not “endless output”.
The decompression speed is good too.

## Source packages

See the [NEWS](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob;f=NEWS) file
for a summary of changes between versions.

The releases have been signed with
[Lasse Collin’s OpenPGP key](https://tukaani.org/misc/lasse_collin_pubkey.txt).

### Stable

XZ Utils 5.6.3 were released on 2024-10-01.
The release includes a security fix
for a command line tool argument injection vulnerability on Windows.
For the old 5.2.13 and 5.4.7 releases,
the fix is available in the v5.2 and v5.4 branches in the Git repository.
New releases won’t be made from the old branches.

5.6.3 (2024-10-01)

XZ Utils source packages are also available on
[Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lzmautils/files/).

### Old releases

Source and binary packages of the
[old XZ Utils releases](old.html)
are available on a separate page.

## Development

The primary [Git repository](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)
is on GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz
```

The repository is mirrored (with some delay) to
[git.tukaani.org](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git) as well.

The **master** branch contains the latest development code.

Maintenance status of the stable branches:

* **v5.6**: maintained until 5.8.0 is ready
* **v5.4**: critical fixes only (no new releases)
* **v5.2**: critical fixes only (no new releases)
* **v5.0**: unmaintained

The other branches on GitHub are temporary development branches
which also see force pushes.
These branches aren’t mirrored to git.tukaani.org.

### Building from xz.git

Two multi-platform build systems are supported:

* The **GNU Autotools**-based build is old,
  feature complete, and the most tested.
  Apart from Windows, DOS, and OpenVMS, the Autotools-based build is
  the most likely to work on less common or old platforms.
  Run `./autogen.sh` to generate the `configure` script and other files.
* **CMake**-based build became feature complete in June 2024.
  However, it hasn’t received as much testing as the Autotools-based build.
  See the notes at the top of
  [CMakeLists.txt](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob;f=CMakeLists.txt).

Special cases: OpenVMS and DOS builds use different build systems.
See the file [INSTALL](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob;f=INSTALL).

#### Minimum Autotools and CMake versions

For **GNU Autotools**,
it is recommended to use the latest versions.
The minimum versions required are old though:

* Autoconf 2.69
* Automake 1.12
* gettext 0.19.6
* Libtool 2.4

For the **CMake** build, version 3.20 or greater is required.
Translation support also requires that GNU gettext-tools are installed.

#### Optional dependencies

[po4a](https://po4a.org/) is needed for translated documentation (man pages).

* Autotools: To build without po4a,
  pass `--no-po4a` as the argument to `autogen.sh`.
* CMake: Run the shell script `po4a/update-po` to generate the translated
  man pages inside the source tree (thus the source tree will have extra files;
  it won’t stay completely clean).
  If the translated man pages exist in the source tree,
  `make install` will install them
  if translation support was enabled (`XZ_NLS`).

[Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) can be used
to generate liblzma API documentation in HTML format
which `make install` will also install.
Doxygen usage is disabled by default.

* Autotools: Pass `--enable-doxygen` as an argument to `configure`.
* CMake: Pass `-DXZ_DOXYGEN=ON` as an argument to `cmake`.

### Future build system plans

People have wished for [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) support and
work on it has been started.

While dropping Autotools is tempting,
there are use cases where Autotools have benefits still:

* Easier bootstrapping on modern operating systems.
  [muon](https://muon.build/) might make this
  easier with Meson-based build though.
* Better support for old or obscure operating systems.
  As time goes on, these get less and less important though.

## Bindings

* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html)
* Perl:
  [IO-Compress-Lzma](https://metacpan.org/dist/IO-Compress-Lzma)
  and
  [Compress-Raw-Lzma](https://metacpan.org/dist/Compress-Raw-Lzma)
* [Haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lzma)
* [Delphi and Free Pascal](https://github.com/delphiunderground/xz-examples-delphi)

## Binary packages

Many free software operating systems already provide easy-to-install
XZ Utils binaries.
It doesn’t make sense to provide links to all those here.

No up-to-date binaries for Windows or DOS are currently available.
See the [old releases](old.html#_binary_packages) page for old versions.

## Supported platforms

Below is an incomplete and somewhat vague (version numbers mostly missing)
list of operating systems on which XZ Utils should work.
Compiler(s) or toolchains are mentioned in parenthesis.
GCC refers to GCC 3 or later.
If Clang/LLVM is available for the operating system then it should work too.
Additions and corrections are welcome.

* GNU/Linux (GCC, Clang, ICC, ICX, XL C)
* GNU/Hurd (GCC)
* DragonflyBSD
* FreeBSD
* MirBSD
* NetBSD
* OpenBSD
* MINIX 3.3.0 and later
  [[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]
* Haiku
* SerenityOS
* AROS and AmigaOS
* macOS / Mac OS X / Darwin
* Solaris 10, 11 (GCC, Sun Studio / Oracle Developer Studio)
  [[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]
* AIX (GCC, XL C) [[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]
* z/OS UNIX System Services (XL C) [[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]
* QNX
* HP-UX (GCC, HP ANSI C) [[2](#_footnotedef_2 "View footnote.")]
* OpenVMS (HP C compiler) [[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]
* OpenVOS 17 (GCC)
* Windows 2000 and later (GCC or Clang/LLVM with MinGW-w64,
  GCC/Cygwin, Visual Studio 2015 or later) [[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]
* DOS e.g. FreeDOS and MS-DOS (GCC/DJGPP) [[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]

XZ Utils have or had support for the following operating systems
but recent releases might not work anymore.
If the latest XZ Utils don’t work,
try XZ Utils 5.4.7 or an even older release.
Support for obsolete operating systems and versions
might be retained or restored if it is easy to do.

* Solaris 9 and older
  [[3](#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")]
* IRIX (MIPSpro) [[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]
* Tru64 (GCC, Compaq C compiler)
  [[4](#_footnotedef_4 "View footnote.")]
* SCO OpenServer 5 (GCC 3.4.6, 4.2.4)
  [[5](#_footnotedef_5 "View footnote.")]
* Windows 95/98/98SE/ME, NT4, Interix
  (pre-W2k support was disabled after XZ Utils 5.4.x)
* OS/2, eComStation (GCC)

## Licensing

From the version 5.5.2beta onwards,
the core components of XZ Utils are under the
[BSD Zero Clause License](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob;f=COPYING.0BSD)
(0BSD).
The earlier versions that were released as public domain
obviously remain in the public domain.

Some parts of XZ Utils (for example,
scripts from GNU gzip and some build system files)
are under different free software licenses such as
GNU LGPLv2.1, GNU GPLv2, or GNU GPLv3.

See the file [COPYING](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob;f=COPYING)
for more details.

# CVE-2020-22916

| **Name** | CVE-2020-22916 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | An issue discovered in XZ 5.2.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via decompression of a crafted file. NOTE: the vendor disputes the claims of "endless output" and "denial of service" because decompression of the 17,486 bytes always results in 114,881,179 bytes, which is often a reasonable size increase. |

## Notes

```
Bogus CVE, original URL is gone and resource limits are a natural constraint for any unpacker

| Hello!  This CVE was never reported to us, so we do not have any further information about it. So at this moment we cannot say which versions of XZ Utils this effects or if it was unknowingly patched by a change made after 5.2.5.  If you or anyone else has additional information about this CVE please share it over email or through a [GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/security/advisories). For more information please see [our Security Policy](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md).  Thanks for bringing this to our attention. |

| There's now a little more information in the NVD. The [entry in Debian](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-22916) is somewhat informative:  Bogus CVE, original URL is gone and resource limits are a natural constraint for any unpacker  That makes me wonder if it could have been a file which uses a 4 GiB LZMA2 dictionary and thus needs lots of RAM even in single-threaded mode. xz has had memory usage limiting options for such files since the first stable version because high memory usage could be a denial of service. Strict limits (which would make xz refuse to decompress) aren't enabled by default because of the strong feedback I got before 5.0.0 was released: a too low limit can also result in a denial of service. The [Memory usage](https://tukaani.org/xz/man/xz.1.html#DESCRIPTION:_Memory_usage) section on the xz man page has been there since 5.0.0 too.  This was just a guess; the CVE could be about something else, of course. With the information I currently have, I consider this CVE to be incorrect (not a bug or a security issue). |

| The snappyJack repository is available again. It contains a corrupt .lzma file which uses a tiny 256-byte dictionary. So decompression needs very little memory. The reporter claims that decompressing it "could cause endless output".  Both XZ Utils and even the long-deprecated LZMA Utils produce 114,881,179 bytes of output from the payload before reporting an error. This is not "endless output". The decompression speed is good too.  There is no denial of service or other bug with this file. |

hi,

I found a denial of service vulnerability in XZ 5.2.5, and it both work on Windows and linux.When the xz decompress a designed file from hacker,it could cause endless output,and leading to denial of service.

Here is the step of POC:

### Windows version

use `xz.exe -c -d payload` ,you can see endless output like this:

[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snappyJack/CVE-request-XZ-5.2.5-has-denial-of-service-vulnerability/master/img/windos_endless.jpg?token=AD2P2FJTCLORTZ2U7VDRWCK6SU6UU)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snappyJack/CVE-request-XZ-5.2.5-has-denial-of-service-vulnerability/master/img/windos_endless.jpg?token=AD2P2FJTCLORTZ2U7VDRWCK6SU6UU)

use `xz.exe -c -d payload > result` to save the output leading denial of service.

### Linux version

use `./bin/unxz -c payload` or `./bin/unxz -c payload` you can see endless output like this:

[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snappyJack/CVE-request-XZ-5.2.5-has-denial-of-service-vulnerability/master/img/linux_endless.jpg?token=AD2P2FJCYMHR4L2E6YGFMLC6SU6VA)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snappyJack/CVE-request-XZ-5.2.5-has-denial-of-service-vulnerability/master/img/linux_endless.jpg?token=AD2P2FJCYMHR4L2E6YGFMLC6SU6VA)

use `./bin/unxz -c payload > result`  or `./bin/unxz -c payload > result` to save the output leading denial of service.

# CVE-request-XZ-5.2.5-has-denial-of-service-vulnerability

---

hi,

I found a denial of service vulnerability in XZ 5.2.5, and it both work on Windows and linux.When the xz decompress a designed file from hacker,it could cause endless output,and leading to denial of service.

Here is the step of POC:

### Windows version

use `xz.exe -c -d payload` ,you can see endless output like this:

use `xz.exe -c -d payload > result` to save the output leading denial of service.

### Linux version

use `./bin/unxz -c payload` or `./bin/unxz -c payload` you can see endless output like this:

use `./bin/unxz -c payload > result`  or `./bin/unxz -c payload > result` to save the output leading denial of service.
