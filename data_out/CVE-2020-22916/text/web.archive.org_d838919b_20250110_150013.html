# CVE-request-XZ-5.2.5-has-denial-of-service-vulnerability

---

hi,

I found a denial of service vulnerability in XZ 5.2.5, and it both work on Windows and linux.When the xz decompress a designed file from hacker,it could cause endless output,and leading to denial of service.

Here is the step of POC:

### Windows version

use `xz.exe -c -d payload` ,you can see endless output like this:

use `xz.exe -c -d payload > result` to save the output leading denial of service.

### Linux version

use `./bin/unxz -c payload` or `./bin/unxz -c payload` you can see endless output like this:

use `./bin/unxz -c payload > result`  or `./bin/unxz -c payload > result` to save the output leading denial of service.
