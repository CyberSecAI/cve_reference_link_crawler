| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1214590#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2023-08-24 15:05:54 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-22916  An issue discovered in XZ 5.2.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via decompression of crafted file.  The below github link is not working. Unclear about how this can be reproduced or if we have a fix.  References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-22916> <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-22916> <https://github.com/snappyJack/CVE-request-XZ-5.2.5-has-denial-of-service-vulnerability> <https://tukaani.org/xz/> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1214590#c1)  Danilo Spinella   2023-10-11 10:05:10 UTC  ``` Looking at the github issue in xz repository [1], it seems that this is not an actual issue.  <https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/61> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1214590#c2)  Alexander Bergmann   2024-07-22 15:28:53 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/8120#issuecomment-1736002820>  "Closing since upstream is disputing this; we also updated anyway and the new version is not reporting this issue."  Closing as invalid. ``` |  |
