- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings. Specifically, the "Bar Size" and "Image Counter Separator" settings are vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the victim's browser. This can enable attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface websites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker, with admin privileges, can inject malicious javascript code into the pluginâ€™s settings via the WordPress admin dashboard. Subsequently, any user who views a page or post that displays the gallery widget will execute the injected javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges on the WordPress site to modify the vulnerable plugin's settings.
