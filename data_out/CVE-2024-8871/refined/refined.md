Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `add_query_arg` function in the Easy Pricing Tables plugin without proper escaping of the URL. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input (specifically, URL parameters) when generating web pages, leading to the execution of malicious scripts when a user clicks a manipulated link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in the victim's browser session.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Stealing cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the query parameters.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks on the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on a malicious URL.
