  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Remisol Advance Launcher, specifically versions v2.0.12.1 and below, has insecure file permissions set during installation. These permissions allow non-privileged users to overwrite or manipulate executable files and libraries used by services that run as the SYSTEM user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure file permissions that allow non-privileged users to modify critical system files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain SYSTEM level privileges by replacing legitimate service executables with malicious code. This grants the attacker full control of the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the workstation is required. Specifically, a low-level permission is required, which can be achieved via weak or default passwords or systems with no password.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have low-level access to the workstation. This can be achieved with weak or default passwords or if the workstation has no password.  The attacker must also be able to replace the service executable (LauncherService.exe or any associated library used with the service) with a malicious binary."
