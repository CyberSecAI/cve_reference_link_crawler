The Metasploit Module CYFIRMA Researchers examined here provides a lens into the vulnerability exploitation, demonstrating its potential for both defenders and adversaries. The Exploit Code can be found [here](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174398/Apache-NiFi-H2-Connection-String-Remote-Code-Execution.html).

**Module Workflow:** The journey of this module unfolds in several critical phases:

* **Initialization:** The module begins its workflow by initializing key parameters. These parameters include the target’s base path and a delay timer. Setting the base path ensures that subsequent requests are directed to the correct location within the Apache NiFi instance.
* **Configuration:** After initialization, the module moves on to configure the Database Connection Pool (DBCP) and HikariCP Controller Services. These configurations are critical as they set the stage for the exploitation of the CVE- 2023-34468 vulnerability. Specifically, they allow for the manipulation of a Database URL using the H2 driver.
  + **Payload Preparation:** Before proceeding further, the module prepares a payload for execution. This payload is encoded in Base64, making it suitable for transmission over the network. Importantly, if the payload contains characters that could trigger issues, such as ‘=’, the module pads it with spaces to prevent any unexpected behavior during execution.
  + **Target Version Check:** To ensure the chosen exploitation technique is compatible with the Apache NiFi instance, the module performs a version check. It retrieves and evaluates the version of Apache NiFi running on the target system. This step is crucial for selecting the appropriate methods and payloads for exploitation.
  + **Execution:** With the groundwork laid, the module proceeds to execute the exploitation. This process unfolds in a sequence of steps:
    - **Processor Configuration:** The module creates a processor within the Apache NiFi instance. This processor is an essential component in the exploitation process, and it is configured to interact with the manipulated Database Connection Pool (DBCP).
    - **DBCP Configuration:** Simultaneously, the module configures the Database Connection Pool. This configuration includes specifying properties, such as the Database Connection URL, Database Driver Class Name (in this case, ‘org.h2.Driver’), and the location of the H2 driver. Notably, the Database Connection URL is structured to include the payload that triggers code execution.
    - **DBCP Activation:** Once configured, the module activates the DB Connection Pool, ensuring that it is in a state where it can be used for interactions with the manipulated Database URL.
    - **Processor Activation:** With the DB Connection Pool ready, the module proceeds to activate the processor. This activation triggers the execution of the payload embedded in the Database Connection URL.
* **Post-Exploitation Cleanup:** The module doesn’t leave the target system in disarray. After successful exploitation, it meticulously handles cleanup tasks to minimize any traces of the intrusion. The cleanup steps include:
  + **Stopping Processor:** The module halts the processor it created during the exploitation process. This step is crucial in preventing any unintended activities or side effects caused by the processor.
  + **Deleting Processor:** Following the halt, the module proceeds to delete the processor entirely from the Apache NiFi instance. This ensures that there are no lingering artifacts of the exploitation.
  + **DBCP Handling:** The module stops and disables the manipulated Database Connection Pool (DBCP). This step ensures that the connection pool is no longer available for further interactions.
  + **DBCP Deletion:** Finally, the module deletes the manipulated Database Connection Pool. This comprehensive cleanup process leaves the target system in a stable state, minimizing the risk of detection.

## MITIGATION

To mitigate the risk associated with CVE-2023-34468, Apache NiFi users should take the following actions:

* **Update or Patch:** Apache NiFi maintainers have released patches/updates to address this vulnerability. Users should apply these promptly.
* **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to limit exposure of Apache NiFi instances to untrusted networks.
* **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor Apache NiFi systems for any suspicious activity or signs of compromise.
* **Access Controls:** Enforce strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to Apache NiFi.
* **Stay Informed:** Keep abreast of security advisories and updates from Apache NiFi and the broader cybersecurity community to stay informed about emerging threats and mitigations.

## EXTERNAL THREAT LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
