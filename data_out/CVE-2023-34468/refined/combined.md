The Metasploit Module CYFIRMA Researchers examined here provides a lens into the vulnerability exploitation, demonstrating its potential for both defenders and adversaries. The Exploit Code can be found [here](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174398/Apache-NiFi-H2-Connection-String-Remote-Code-Execution.html).

**Module Workflow:** The journey of this module unfolds in several critical phases:

* **Initialization:** The module begins its workflow by initializing key parameters. These parameters include the target’s base path and a delay timer. Setting the base path ensures that subsequent requests are directed to the correct location within the Apache NiFi instance.
* **Configuration:** After initialization, the module moves on to configure the Database Connection Pool (DBCP) and HikariCP Controller Services. These configurations are critical as they set the stage for the exploitation of the CVE- 2023-34468 vulnerability. Specifically, they allow for the manipulation of a Database URL using the H2 driver.
  + **Payload Preparation:** Before proceeding further, the module prepares a payload for execution. This payload is encoded in Base64, making it suitable for transmission over the network. Importantly, if the payload contains characters that could trigger issues, such as ‘=’, the module pads it with spaces to prevent any unexpected behavior during execution.
  + **Target Version Check:** To ensure the chosen exploitation technique is compatible with the Apache NiFi instance, the module performs a version check. It retrieves and evaluates the version of Apache NiFi running on the target system. This step is crucial for selecting the appropriate methods and payloads for exploitation.
  + **Execution:** With the groundwork laid, the module proceeds to execute the exploitation. This process unfolds in a sequence of steps:
    - **Processor Configuration:** The module creates a processor within the Apache NiFi instance. This processor is an essential component in the exploitation process, and it is configured to interact with the manipulated Database Connection Pool (DBCP).
    - **DBCP Configuration:** Simultaneously, the module configures the Database Connection Pool. This configuration includes specifying properties, such as the Database Connection URL, Database Driver Class Name (in this case, ‘org.h2.Driver’), and the location of the H2 driver. Notably, the Database Connection URL is structured to include the payload that triggers code execution.
    - **DBCP Activation:** Once configured, the module activates the DB Connection Pool, ensuring that it is in a state where it can be used for interactions with the manipulated Database URL.
    - **Processor Activation:** With the DB Connection Pool ready, the module proceeds to activate the processor. This activation triggers the execution of the payload embedded in the Database Connection URL.
* **Post-Exploitation Cleanup:** The module doesn’t leave the target system in disarray. After successful exploitation, it meticulously handles cleanup tasks to minimize any traces of the intrusion. The cleanup steps include:
  + **Stopping Processor:** The module halts the processor it created during the exploitation process. This step is crucial in preventing any unintended activities or side effects caused by the processor.
  + **Deleting Processor:** Following the halt, the module proceeds to delete the processor entirely from the Apache NiFi instance. This ensures that there are no lingering artifacts of the exploitation.
  + **DBCP Handling:** The module stops and disables the manipulated Database Connection Pool (DBCP). This step ensures that the connection pool is no longer available for further interactions.
  + **DBCP Deletion:** Finally, the module deletes the manipulated Database Connection Pool. This comprehensive cleanup process leaves the target system in a stable state, minimizing the risk of detection.

## MITIGATION

To mitigate the risk associated with CVE-2023-34468, Apache NiFi users should take the following actions:

# Apache NiFi Security

Apache NiFi welcomes the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. Project Management Committee members will
collaborate and respond to potential vulnerabilities, providing an assessment of the concern and a plan of action to
remediate verified issues.

## Reporting Policy

Please read the [Apache Project Security for Committers](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html)
policy for general guidelines applicable disclosure of security issues for Apache Software Foundation projects.

Do not perform the following actions after discovering a potential security concern:

* Open a Jira disclosing a security vulnerability to the public
* Send a message to the project mailing lists disclosing a security vulnerability to the public
* Send a message to the project Slack instance disclosing a security vulnerability to the public

## Reporting Guidelines

Configuring dangerous operating system commands or custom scripts is not a project security vulnerability.
Authenticated and authorized users are responsible for the security of operating system commands and custom
code.

Apache NiFi provides a framework for developing processing pipelines using standard and custom
components. The framework supports configurable permissions that enable authorized users to execute code
using several standard components. Components such as ExecuteProcess and ExecuteStreamCommand support
running operating system commands, while other scripted components support executing custom code using
different programming languages. Configuring these components with untrusted commands or arguments is
contrary to best practices, but it does not constitute of security issue for remediation.

## Reporting Process

* Notify the project on initial discovery of a potential security vulnerability
* Provide a reasonable amount of time for an initial assessment and remediation plan
* Limit interaction to accounts under direct control or accounts with explicit permission of the owner
* Avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of services
* Avoid spamming, social engineering, and methods to manipulate project members

## Reporting Methods

* Security Mailing List: security@nifi.apache.org
  + Members of the Project Management Committee monitor this private mailing list and respond to disclosures

## Severity Ratings

Severity ratings represent the determination of project members based on an evaluation of
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) calculations.

* Critical: Arbitrary code execution from a remote attacker
* High: Compromise of integrity or availability through resource exhaustion
* Medium: Requires special configuration settings and significant mitigations are available
* Low: Minimal impact and significant difficulty of exploitation

# Published Vulnerabilities

The following announcements include published vulnerabilities that apply directly to Apache NiFi components.

### CVE-2024-56512

* Title: Missing Complete Authorization for Parameter and Service References
* Published: 2024-12-27
* Severity: Low
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.10.0 to 2.0.0
* Fixed Versions: 2.1.0
* Reporter: Matt Gilman
* References
  + CVE Record: [CVE-2024-56512](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56512)
  + NVD Record: [CVE-2024-56512](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56512)
  + Apache Jira Issue: [NIFI-13976](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13976)
  + GitHub Pull Request: [9535](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9535)

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 2.0.0 are missing fine-grained authorization checking for Parameter Contexts, referenced
Controller Services, and referenced Parameter Providers, when creating new Process Groups. Creating a new Process Group
can include binding to a Parameter Context, but in cases where the Process Group did not reference any Parameter values,
the framework did not check user authorization for the bound Parameter Context. Missing authorization for a bound
Parameter Context enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process Group. Creating
a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did
not check user authorization for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers, enabling clients to create
Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized. This vulnerability is limited in scope to
authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with
component-based authorization policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation, which includes
authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process Group creation.

### CVE-2024-52067

* Title: Potential Insertion of Sensitive Parameter Values in Debug Log
* Published: 2024-11-20
* Severity: Medium
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.16.0 to 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 to 2.0.0-M4
* Fixed Versions: 1.28.1 and 2.0.0
* Reporter: David Handermann

  + GitHub Pull Request: [9489](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9489)

Apache NiFi 1.16.0 through 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M4 include optional debug logging of Parameter Context values
during the flow synchronization process. An authorized administrator with access to change logging levels could enable debug logging
for framework flow synchronization, causing the application to write Parameter names and values to the application log.
Parameter Context values may contain sensitive information depending on application flow configuration.
Deployments of Apache NiFi with the default Logback configuration do not log Parameter Context values.
Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.0.0 or 1.28.1 is the recommendation mitigation, eliminating Parameter value logging from the flow synchronization process regardless of the Logback configuration.

### CVE-2024-45477

* Title: Improper Neutralization of Input in Parameter Description
* Published: 2024-10-28
* Severity: Medium
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.10.0 to 1.27.0 and 2.0.0-M1 to 2.0.0-M3

The optional ShellUserGroupProvider in Apache NiFi 1.10.0 to 1.16.2 and Apache NiFi Registry 0.6.0 to 1.16.2 does not
neutralize arguments for group resolution commands, allowing injection of operating system commands on Linux and macOS
platforms. The ShellUserGroupProvider is not included in the default configuration. Command injection requires
ShellUserGroupProvider to be one of the enabled User Group Providers in the Authorizers configuration. Command injection
also requires an authenticated user with elevated privileges. Apache NiFi requires an authenticated user with
authorization to modify access policies to execute the command. Apache NiFi Registry requires an authenticated user with
authorization to read user groups to execute the command. NiFi and NiFi Registry version 1.16.3 has completely removed
the shell commands from the ShellUserGroupProvider that received user arguments.

Multiple components in Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 do not restrict XML External Entity references in the default
configuration. The Standard Content Viewer service attempts to resolve XML External Entity references when viewing
formatted XML files. The following Processors attempt to resolve XML External Entity references when configured with
default property values: EvaluateXPath, EvaluateXQuery, and ValidateXml. Apache NiFi flow configurations that include
these Processors are vulnerable to malicious XML documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External
Entity references. Upgrading to NiFi 1.16.1 disables Document Type Declarations in the default configuration for these
processors, and disallows XML External Entity resolution in standard services.

When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers
configuration to the operating system temporary directory. The Login Identity Providers configuration file contains the
username and a bcrypt hash of the configured password. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has
global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which
significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. Bcrypt is a password-hashing algorithm that incorporates a
random salt and a specified cost factor, designed to maintain resistance to brute-force attacks. Use of the bcrypt
algorithm minimizes the impact of disclosing the single-user credentials stored in Login Identity Providers. NiFi 1.16.0
includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system
temporary directory.

The NiFi UI and API were protected by mandating TLS v1.2, as well as listening connections established by processors
like ListenHTTP and HandleHttpRequest. However intra-cluster communication such as cluster request replication,
Site-to-Site, and load balanced queues continued to support TLS 1.0 or 1.1. NiFI 1.12.0 refactored disparate internal
SSL and TLS code, reducing exposure for extension and framework developers to low-level primitives. NiFi 1.12. also
added support for TLS v1.3 on supporting JVMs. This version restricted all incoming TLS communications to TLS
1.2 or higher. Users running any previous NiFi release should upgrade to 1.12.0.

have had read access to. Requests to update or remove the process group will no longer return the contents of the
process group in the response in Apache NiFi 1.10.0. Users running a prior release should upgrade to 1.10.0.

The X-Frame-Options headers were applied inconsistently on some HTTP responses, resulting in duplicate or missing
security headers. Some browsers would interpret these results incorrectly, allowing clickjacking attacks. NiFi 1.8.0
consistently applies the security headers including X-Frame-Options. Users running a prior release should upgrade to
1.8.0.

The message-page.jsp error page used the value of the HTTP request header X-ProxyContextPath without sanitization,
resulting in a potential reflected cross-site scripting attack. NiFi 1.8.0 correctly parses and sanitizes the request
attribute value. Users running a prior release should upgrade to 1.8.0.

### CVE-2018-17194

* Title: Potential Denial of Service with HTTP DELETE Cluster Replication Requests
* Published: 2018-10-26

  + GitHub Pull Request: [3035](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3035)

When a client request to a cluster node was replicated to other nodes in the cluster for verification, the
Content-Length was forwarded. On a DELETE request, the body was ignored, but if the initial request had a Content-Length
value other than 0, the receiving nodes would wait for the body and eventually timeout. NiFi 1.8.0 checks DELETE
requests and overwrites non-zero Content-Length header. Users running a prior release should upgrade to 1.8.0.

The template upload API endpoint accepted requests from different domain when sent in conjunction with ARP spoofing and
meddler in the middle (MITM) intervention, resulting in cross-site request forgery. The required attack vector is
complex, requiring a scenario with client certificate authentication, same subnet access, and injecting malicious code
into an unprotected (plaintext HTTP) website which the targeted user later visits, but the possible damage warranted a
Critical severity level. NiFi 1.8.0 applies Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy request filtering. Users running
a prior release should upgrade to 1.8.0.
