Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly.

These vulnerabilities exist because HTTP packets are not properly checked for errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet to the remote interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the device.
