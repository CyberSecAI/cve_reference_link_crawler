(non-US) DAP-1360 Rev. F1 & (non-US) DAP-2020 Rev. A2 :: Multiple vulnerabilities by ZDI at TrendMicro

**Overview**

On September 8, 2022, 3rd party security research from TrendMicro ZDI reported the (non-US) D-Link DIR-1360 hardware revision Fx with firmware versions v6.14B01 as having multiple vulnerabilities.

As soon as D-Link was made aware of the reported security issues, we had promptly started our investigation and began developing security patches. During the investigation the (non-US) D-Link DAP-2020 hardware revision Fx was also affected by these same vulnerabilities.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures.
