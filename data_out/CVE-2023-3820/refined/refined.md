The provided content is related to a commit in the `pimcore/pimcore` repository on GitHub. The commit message indicates a bug fix related to quote sorting keys, specifically addressing issues with how order keys are handled in the `GridHelperService.php` file.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The original code was not correctly quoting identifiers in SQL queries when dealing with order keys, especially when those keys involved brick fields (data structure in Pimcore) or multiple parts separated by dots. This could potentially lead to SQL injection if the `orderKey` is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper quoting of identifiers in the SQL query could potentially lead to SQL injection if an attacker could manipulate the `orderKey`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries to access, modify, or delete data stored in the database, leading to a data breach.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could execute SQL queries that could overload the database server leading to denial of service.
- **Data Corruption:** An attacker might be able to modify database records, leading to data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Manipulation of the `orderKey` parameter in requests to the `GridHelperService`.
- This would likely require knowledge of how the application uses the `orderKey` parameter to filter and sort data, and how data structures like brick fields are named.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to influence the `orderKey` parameter passed to the `prepareListingForGrid` function in the `GridHelperService.php` file.
- The attacker might need some understanding of the internal data structure of Pimcore, specifically brick fields and how they are named.

**Code Changes:**
The commit includes the following changes in the `GridHelperService.php` file:

- **Quoting of identifiers**: It now uses `$list->quoteIdentifier()` to properly quote identifiers like table and column names in SQL queries.
- **Improved Handling of different order key formats**:
    - For order keys with a `?`, it extracts the brick descriptor, quotes container and brick field names.
    - For order keys with a single dot, it quotes the table and column name using `$list->quoteIdentifier()`.
    - For other order keys, it quotes the column name using `$list->quoteIdentifier()`.

In summary, the commit addresses potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by ensuring proper quoting of identifiers when building SQL queries, particularly those that involve the `orderKey` parameter.
