Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled parameters when generating dynamic HTML field values in the `ieducar/intranet/include/clsCampos.inc.php` file. This results in reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects user-supplied data without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser by tricking the user into clicking on a malicious URL.
- While the HttpOnly and SameSite=Lax flags limit the attacker's ability to steal session cookies or force actions within the application, the attacker can still perform malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, where a malicious URL with a crafted payload is used.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click a crafted link, usually sent through phishing or social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to craft a malicious URL with an XSS payload in parameters such as `nm_curso`, `nm_pessoa` or `nome`.
- The attacker needs to distribute this crafted URL to potential victims.
- No user privileges are needed for the attack.
- The attacker needs user interaction (the user needs to click on the malicious link)

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple instances, with different parameters being vulnerable.
- The provided PoC shows how a payload can be injected through a `nm_curso` parameter.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.3.
- Affected versions of i-Educar are 2.9 with no patched version available at the time of writing.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
