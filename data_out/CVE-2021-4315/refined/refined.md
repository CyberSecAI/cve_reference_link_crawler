Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `render_template_string` in the `advertisement()` and `give_consent()` functions within `psiturk/experiment.py`. The `mode` parameter, which was derived from the HTTP request argument, was passed directly to the template rendering function. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary code through the `mode` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The application was vulnerable to SSTI, where an attacker could inject template directives into user-controlled input (`mode` parameter) that was then processed by the template engine.
- **Unsanitized User Input:** The application was not sanitizing or validating the `mode` parameter before using it in `render_template_string`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the SSTI vulnerability, an attacker could execute arbitrary Python code on the server.
- **Server-Side File Access:** An attacker could access sensitive files on the server, as demonstrated by the example given of reading `/etc/`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Argument:** The attacker could inject malicious code via the `mode` parameter of an HTTP request to the `/ad` or `/consent` endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application with a controlled `mode` parameter. This could be achieved through a web browser, command-line tools like `curl`, or custom scripts.
- No authentication or special access level is required. Any user could inject code to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the `mode` parameter from the `insert_mode` function call, and instead passing the `mode` variable as a template variable to the `render_template_string` function, which handles the value sanitization.
- The fix also removed an unused parameter from the `insert_mode` function, and updated the test case.
- This vulnerability was reported by a whitehat security researcher.
- The fix was released in version `v3.2.1`.
