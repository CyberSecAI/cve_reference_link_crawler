Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-34533

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the `izi_data` module's `IZITools` class methods (`query_check`, `query_fetch`, and `query_execute`). These methods directly use user-provided `query` parameters in SQL queries, without any form of escaping or parameterized queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the SQL injection flaw. User-supplied data (`query` argument) is directly embedded into SQL queries executed by the application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The methods don't sanitize or validate the `query` input, allowing arbitrary SQL code to be injected.
- **Public API Exposure:** The affected methods are exposed through the External API, making them accessible to both authenticated internal users and portal users.
- **Direct Database Cursor Usage:** The methods use the database cursor directly without any access rights checks, bypassing normal Odoo security mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can elevate their privileges by injecting SQL queries that modify user roles or permissions (e.g. by changing the password of an admin).
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database by crafting specific SQL queries that bypass security measures.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify data stored in the database through crafted SQL injection queries.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can potentially lead to full control over the system, depending on the permissions associated with the database user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **External API:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability via the Odoo's External API. This allows both authenticated internal users and portal users to trigger the vulnerable methods.
- **Crafted `query` Parameter:** The attacker must craft a malicious SQL query that will be injected through the `query` parameter. This query is sent to the vulnerable `IZITools` methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to an Odoo instance where the `izi_data` module is installed.
- **Authenticated User (Internal or Portal):** The attacker needs to have an account (either an internal or portal user account) on the vulnerable Odoo instance to call the External API and trigger the vulnerable method.
- **Knowledge of Odoo API:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to interact with Odoo's External API.
- **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs SQL knowledge to create the injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to modify the admin password via SQL injection.
- The vendor has released a patch, as mentioned in the README.
- The affected product is the "Analytic Data Query" module, also known as `izi_data`, versions 11.0 through 17.x before 17.0.3.
