# Analytic Data Query

Important

The responsible disclosure policy has been followed when reporting this vulnerability. A patch has been made available by the module's vendor before this repository was made public.

Warning

## CVE ID

**CVE-2024-34533**

## Description

A **SQL injection vulnerability** in ZI PT Solusi Usaha Mudah Analytic Data Query module (aka `izi_data`) 11.0 through 17.x before 17.0.3 allows a remote attacker to **gain privileges**.

## Affected product

**Analytic Data Query**

## Technical name of affected product

`izi_data`

## Link to the Odoo Apps Store

<https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/17.0/izi_data/>

## Vulnerability type

SQL injection

## Impact

Privilege Escalation, Information Disclosure

## Affected components:

`models/common/izi_tools.py:IZITools::query_check(query)`
`models/common/izi_tools.py:IZITools::query_fetch(query)`
`models/common/izi_tools.py:IZITools::query_execute(query)`

## Attack vectors

A portal user or internal user of an Odoo instance with the `izi_data` module installed on it can trigger one of these methods using the External API, passing a crafted `query` argument to the method to inject the SQL query of its choice that will be executed through the database cursor.

## Proof-of-Concept

Note

A recorded demo of the PoC as well as the code for the exploit are available under this directory.

User `lucas` is a portal user and thus has no specific permission. User lucas sends an XML-RPC to the `izi.tools` model through the External API , triggering the `query_fetch` method. It passes a crafted `query` argument that injects an SQL query modifying the admin password:

`models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, 'izi.tools', 'query_fetch', ["UPDATE res_users SET password='a' WHERE login='admin'; SELECT password FROM res_users WHERE login='admin';"]`

Since the vulnerable method is a public method, it can be called from the External API. Also, since the database cursor is directly employed, no access rights checking is performed. No user input validation or sanitation is performed, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, with consequences ranging from information disclosure to data tampering and privilege escalation. A possible patch could make use of prepared statements or make the affected method private to be no longer callable from the External API.
