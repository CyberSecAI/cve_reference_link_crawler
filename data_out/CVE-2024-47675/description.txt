In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix use-after-free in bpf_uprobe_multi_link_attach()

If bpf_link_prime() fails, bpf_uprobe_multi_link_attach() goes to the
error_free label and frees the array of bpf_uprobe's without calling
bpf_uprobe_unregister().

This leaks bpf_uprobe->uprobe and worse, this frees bpf_uprobe->consumer
without removing it from the uprobe->consumers list.
