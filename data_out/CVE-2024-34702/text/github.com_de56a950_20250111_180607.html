### @randombit **[randombit](/randombit)** commented [May 10, 2024](#issue-2289601420)

Previously name constraint matching worked by smashing all of the constraints and names into `std::string`, then parsing the values back out of the strings *for each match attempt*. This is all quite slow and needless. Instead store the names in their best form for matching in a `std::variant`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
