### @randombit **[randombit](/randombit)** commented [May 11, 2024](#issue-2291023003)

The remainder of path validation logic is still subject to attacker controlled inputs, but the range of inputs is reduced to that which a legitimate certificate authority was willing to sign.

Backport of [#4045](https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/4045)

Sorry, something went wrong.
