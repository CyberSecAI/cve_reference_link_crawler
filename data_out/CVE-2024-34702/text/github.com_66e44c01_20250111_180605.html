### @randombit **[randombit](/randombit)** commented [May 8, 2024](#issue-2285068073)

The remainder of path validation logic is still subject to attacker controlled inputs, but the range of inputs is reduced to that which a legitimate certificate authority was willing to sign.

Sorry, something went wrong.

LGTM. I agree that checking the signature chain first is very sensible.
