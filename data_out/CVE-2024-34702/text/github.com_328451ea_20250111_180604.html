### @randombit **[randombit](/randombit)** commented [Apr 26, 2024](#issue-2266523862)

This provides a completely new and rather more sensible interface, with the old (now deprecated) interface being implemented in terms of the new interface.

It also resolves a performance issue when parsing certificates with many (thousands) of alternative names; previously this triggered some accidentally quadratic code when checking for duplicates.

Performance issue was reported by Bing Shi.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I admit I only worked with X509 a little, so I have no comparison to the previous version. What I see in this new version looks well structured and intuitive 👍

I didn't look into the existing tests. Do we need additional tests for the new interface?

Sorry, something went wrong.
