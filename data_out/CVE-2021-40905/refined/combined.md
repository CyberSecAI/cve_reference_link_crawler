# CVE-2021-40905 - RCE via a crafted .mkp file

**Application:** CheckMK Management Web Console

**Software Revision:** Less than or equal to 2.0.0p17

**Attack type:** RCE

**Solution:** TBD or the MKPs shared on [<https://exchange.checkmk.com/>] are manually reviewed by CheckMk and they look for malicious code or suspicious imports, etc.

**Summary:** The web management console of CheckMk Enterprise Edition (versions 1.5.0 to 2.0.0p17) does not properly sanitise the uploading of ".mkp" files which are Extension Packages, making remote code execution possible. Successful exploitation requires access to the web management interface, either with valid credentials or with a hijacked session of a user with administrator role.

**Technical Description:** See CVE-2021-40905

**Timeline:**

* 2021-09-01 Issues discovered.
* 2021-09-06 First contact with vendor via e-mail.
* 2021-09-08 Vendor response. RCE vulnerabilities were already detected, and would be patched in the next release.
* 2022-03-25 Public disclosure.

IT Monitoring
platform

IT monitoring platform

The heart of the Checkmk platform is the High Performance Core, designed to scale up to millions of services monitored while still retaining a small footprint.

Its REST API and many automations, such as the auto-registration of hosts, take manual work off your IT team’s shoulders.

Checkmk not only monitors everything that powers your business, but also keeps it secure, thanks to granular access control, encryption, and 2FA.

Acquire

Monitor everything, don’t miss anything: our industry-leading selection of 2,000+ vendor-maintained plug-ins allows automated acquisition of health statuses and metrics from a multitude of data sources across servers, networks, clouds, containers, and applications.

Don’t waste your time deciding what to monitor and how to configure it. Checkmk is ready in minutes, recognizes automatically which data is relevant to monitor, and displays key metrics in ready-to-use graphs.

Analyze

Benefit from pre-defined thresholds for alerts that provide out-of-the-box health assessment capabilities for the vast majority of hosts in your IT infrastructure.

Analyze performance using built-in time-series analyzes, or compare metrics across multiple graphs at a glance.

Review historical stats to forecast your future IT infrastructure requirements, or to determine the root cause of degraded performance and abnormal behavior.

Alert

Avoid notification overload by alerting only the team responsible for a specific point of failure.

Easily configure alerts in granular manner and automate escalation of issues when they are not handled on time.

Streamline your team’s workload by automatically creating tickets in third-party tools, such as ServiceNow, Jira, and many more, or send traditional text notifications via email, SMS or Slack.

Resolve

Get ultimate visibility from both built-in and custom dashboards packing key metrics and real-time insights.

Empower your strategy with Business Intelligence, which provides a bird’s-eye view on the availability and performance of key business processes, by mapping application dependencies and/or aggregating various services and hosts into a single state.

Take advantage of custom self-healing: use the alert handler to automatically trigger actions upon detection of new problems.
