- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing file type validation in the `handleUploadFile` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload arbitrary files, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file through the vulnerable `handleUploadFile` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher.
