| Publication Date: | 2024-07-09 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-07-09 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 8.5 |

SUMMARY

Affected applications do not properly restrict the .NET BinaryFormatter when deserializing user-controllable input. This could allow an attacker to cause a type confusion and execute arbitrary code within the affected application.

Siemens has released a new version for SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) V18 and recommends to update to the latest version. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.
