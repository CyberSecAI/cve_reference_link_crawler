In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nfnetlink_osf: fix possible bogus match in nf_osf_find()

nf_osf_find() incorrectly returns true on mismatch, this leads to
copying uninitialized memory area in nft_osf which can be used to leak
stale kernel stack data to userspace.
