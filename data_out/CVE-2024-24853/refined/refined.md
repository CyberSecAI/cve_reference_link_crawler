Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an "incorrect behavior order in the transition between the executive monitor and the SMI transfer monitor (STM)" in some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper transition logic between executive monitor and STM.
- This improper logic can be triggered to enable an escalation of privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege, which implies an attacker could gain higher access levels than they should have, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a "privileged user."
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The CVSS vector indicates the User interaction is required (UI:R and UI:P)
- The Attack Complexity is High (AC:H) and Attack Vector is Local (AV:L)

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- Intel is releasing microcode updates to mitigate this issue.
- The affected products span a wide range of Intel processor families, from Xeon to Core series, across various generations.
- The issue was internally discovered and reported.
- Intel has provided links to the microcode update repository on GitHub.
