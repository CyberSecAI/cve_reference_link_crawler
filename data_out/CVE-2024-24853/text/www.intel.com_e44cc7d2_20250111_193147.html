Recommendation:

Intel recommends that users of affected Intel® Processors update to the latest firmware provided by the system manufacturer that addresses this issue.

Intel has released microcode update for the affected products that are currently supported on the public github repository.

Please see details below on access to the microcode:

Public Github:  <https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files>.

The microcode patch can be OS loaded.

### Acknowledgements:

This issue was discovered internally by Intel employees. Intel would like to thank Ezra Caltum for reporting this issue.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
