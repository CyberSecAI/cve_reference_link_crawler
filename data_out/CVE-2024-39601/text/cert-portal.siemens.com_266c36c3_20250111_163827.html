SUMMARY

Multiple SICAM products are affected by unauthorized password reset and firmware downgrade vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation and potential leak of information, namely:

* SICAM A8000 Device firmware

  + CPCI85 for CP-8031/CP-8050
* SICAM EGS Device firmware

  + CPCI85
* SICAM 8 Software Solution

  + SICORE

Siemens has released new firmware versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* CVE-2024-37998: Disable the auto login feature

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.
Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.
As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-37998

The password of administrative accounts of the affected applications can be reset without requiring the knowledge of the current password, given the auto login is enabled. This could allow an unauthorized attacker to obtain administrative access of the affected applications.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 9.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 9.3 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-620: Unverified Password Change |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-39601

Affected devices allow a remote authenticated user or an unauthenticated user with physical access to downgrade the firmware of the device. This could allow an attacker to downgrade the device to older versions with known vulnerabilities.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 6.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
