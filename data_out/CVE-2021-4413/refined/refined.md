{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `save()` function of the Process Steps Template Designer plugin. Specifically, the nonce check is skipped if the nonce parameter is not present in the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
       "Missing nonce validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially save field icons by forging a request if they can trick a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking on a malicious link. This could lead to the modification of website content or settings.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request that bypasses the nonce check and sends the forged data to the vulnerable save() function. This is achieved through a crafted link that an administrator would be tricked into clicking.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a site administrator into performing an action (e.g. clicking on a link) to trigger the forged request. No special privileges are needed by the attacker."
