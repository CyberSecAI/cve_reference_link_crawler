Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26305:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) stemming from a poorly constructed regular expression in the `CommonRegexJS` library. The regex is used for identifying links. Specifically, the ambiguity and overlapping nature of the regex clauses lead to exponential backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `links` regular expression in `CommonRegexJS` is vulnerable to ReDoS due to the potential for exponential backtracking. The regex contains overlapping patterns that allow for multiple ways to match the same input, causing the regex engine to try many different combinations when provided with a malicious input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS). By providing a specific input string, an attacker can cause the vulnerable regular expression to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to the application becoming unresponsive or unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the input to the vulnerable regular expression. In this case, if the library is used to parse user-provided input (e.g., URLs) then an attacker can provide a specially crafted long string with many repeated characters or symbols. This will cause the vulnerable regex to go into exponential backtracking leading to a DoS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `CommonRegexJS` library where the vulnerable regex is used. This could be any context where the library is used to parse user input, for example parsing URLs submitted to a server.

**Additional notes:**
- The report provides examples of vulnerable regular expressions and how to fix them.
- The vulnerability was discovered using a CodeQL query.
- The report includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using a simple javascript snippet.
- The vulnerable regex is the `links` regex.
