- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `download-file.php` page does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `Racine` and `FileName` parameters, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or source code.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `download-file.php` endpoint, including malicious values in the `Racine` and `FileName` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker does not require any authentication to trigger this vulnerability.
