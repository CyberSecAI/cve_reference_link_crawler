A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, affecting users of the experimental permission model when the --allow-fs-write flag is used.

Node.js Permission Model do not operate on file descriptors, however, operations such as fs.fchown or fs.fchmod can use a "read-only" file descriptor to change the owner and permissions of a file.
