Monday, July 8, 2024 Security Releases
## [Security releases available](#security-releases-available)

Updates are now available for the 22.x, 20.x, 18.x Node.js release lines for the
following issues.

## [Bypass incomplete fix of CVE-2024-27980 (CVE-2024-36138) - (High)](#bypass-incomplete-fix-of-cve-2024-27980-cve-2024-36138---high)

The CVE-2024-27980 was identified as an incomplete fix for the BatBadBut vulnerability.
This vulnerability arises from improper handling of batch files with all
possible extensions on Windows via `child_process.spawn` / `child_process.spawnSync`.
A malicious command line argument can inject arbitrary commands and achieve code execution
even if the shell option is not enabled.

This vulnerability affects all users of `child_process.spawn` and `child_process.spawnSync`
on Windows in all active release lines.

Impact:

* This vulnerability affects all Windows users in active release lines: 22.x, 20.x, 18.x

Thank you, to tianst for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it.

## [Bypass network import restriction via data URL (CVE-2024-22020) - (Medium)](#bypass-network-import-restriction-via-data-url-cve-2024-22020---medium)

A security flaw in Node.js allows a bypass of network import restrictions.

By embedding non-network imports in data URLs, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, compromising system security.

Verified on various platforms, the vulnerability is mitigated by forbidding data URLs in network imports.

Exploiting this flaw can violate network import security, posing a risk to developers and servers.

Impact:

* This vulnerability affects all users in active release lines: 22.x, 20.x, 18.x

Thank you, to dittyroma for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it.

## [fs.fchown/fchmod bypasses permission model (CVE-2024-36137) - (Low)](#fsfchownfchmod-bypasses-permission-model-cve-2024-36137---low)

A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, affecting users of the experimental
permission model when the `--allow-fs-write` flag is used.

Node.js Permission Model do not operate on file descriptors, however, operations such
as `fs.fchown` or `fs.fchmod` can use a "read-only" file descriptor to change the
owner and permissions of a file.

This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 22.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impact:

* This vulnerability affects all users in active release lines: 22.x, 20.x

Thank you, to 4xpl0r3r for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it.

## [fs.lstat bypasses permission model (CVE-2024-22018) - (Low)](#fslstat-bypasses-permission-model-cve-2024-22018---low)

A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, affecting users of the experimental permission model when
the `--allow-fs-read` flag is used.
This flaw arises from an inadequate permission model that fails to restrict file stats through the
`fs.lstat` API. As a result, malicious actors can retrieve stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.

This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 22.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impact:

* This vulnerability affects all users in active release lines: 22.x, 20.x

Thank you, to haxatron1 for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it.

## [Permission model improperly processes UNC paths (CVE-2024-37372) - (low)](#permission-model-improperly-processes-unc-paths-cve-2024-37372---low)

The Permission Model assumes that any path starting with two backslashes \ has a four-character prefix that can be ignored, which is not always true. This subtle bug leads to vulnerable edge cases.

This vulnerability affects Windows users of the Node.js Permission Model in version v22.x and v20.x

Impact:

* This vulnerability affects all users in active release lines: 22.x, 20.x

Thank you, to tniessen for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it.

## [Downloads and release details](#downloads-and-release-details)
