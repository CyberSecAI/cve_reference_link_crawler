  "CVE-2024-32034": {
    "related": true,
    "description": "The admin panel is subject to potential XSS attach in case an admin assigns a valuator to a proposal, or does any other action that generates an admin activity log where one of the resources has an XSS crafted.",
     "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a failure to properly sanitize and escape user-controlled input when rendering resource titles and descriptions within admin activity logs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the admin panel through resource titles or descriptions displayed in admin logs. When an admin views this log, the injected script could execute, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions within the admin context.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of data associated with resources logged in the admin panel. This could be accomplished by crafting malicious titles or descriptions when creating or updating resources. The vulnerability is triggered when an admin user views the log containing these crafted resource entries."
       ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs low privileges to create or edit a resource with crafted title/description. User interaction is required, where an administrator must view the log to trigger the XSS."
