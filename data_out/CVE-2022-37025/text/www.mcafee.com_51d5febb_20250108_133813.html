\* Important Terms and Offer Details:

.

*+*Subscription, Free Trial, Pricing and Automatic Renewal Terms:

*-*Subscription, Free Trial, Pricing and Automatic Renewal Terms:

* The amount you are charged upon purchase is the price of the first term of your subscription. The length of your first term depends on your purchase selection. 30 days before your first term is expired, your subscription will be automatically renewed on an annual basis and you will be charged the renewal subscription price in effect at the time of your renewal, until you cancel (Vermont residents must opt-in to auto-renewal.)
* Unless otherwise stated, if a savings amount is shown, it describes the difference between the introductory first term price (available only to customers without an existing McAfee subscription) and the renewal subscription price (e.g., first term price vs. each year thereafter).
* Pricing is subject to change. If the renewal price changes, we will notify you in advance so you always know what’s going on.
* You can cancel your subscription or change your auto-renewal settings any time after purchase from your [My Account](https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/MyAccount/DashBoard.aspx?culture=en-us "My Account") page. To learn more, [click here](https://service.mcafee.com/?locale=en-US&articleId=TS102648&fromSearch=true&page=shell&shell=article-view "Article").

* **Free Trial Terms:** At the end of your trial period you will be charged $39.99 for the first term. After the first term, you will be automatically renewed at the renewal price (currently $109.99/yr). We will charge you 7-days before renewal. You can cancel at any time before you are charged. ​
* Plans with unlimited device protection cover only household devices that you own for personal, non-commercial use, and are subject to our fair use policy. If you have an issue adding a device, please contact [Customer Support](https://www.mcafee.com/support "support").
