| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2039448#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2022-01-11 17:59:09 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the linux kernel in scsi_ioctl() function. If the parameter cmd is SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND, the function scsi_ioctl will call sg_scsi_ioctl to further process. In function sg_scsi_ioctl, it creates a scsi request and calls blk_rq_map_kern to allocate the internal buffer of this request, but the internal buffer doesn't get zeroed properly. Then this request will be sent to the disk driver, but the disk driver doesn't fill anything into it. Finally, the internal buffer's content is copied to the user buffer which is specified by the parameter sic->data of sg_scsi_ioctl.
