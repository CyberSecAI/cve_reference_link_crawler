  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2024-40977",
      "root_cause": "A deadlock occurs during chip recovery (e.g., chip reset) in the MediaTek mt7921s Wi-Fi driver. The `reset_work` kernel worker holds a lock and waits for the `stat_worker` kernel thread to be parked, while `stat_worker` is waiting for the same lock to be released.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Concurrency issue leading to a deadlock due to improper locking during chip recovery.",
        "Lack of synchronization between `reset_work` and `stat_worker`."
      ],
      "impact": "The deadlock results in hung tasks messages being dumped and can potentially lead to a device reboot. The Wi-Fi functionality will be interrupted.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by events causing chip recovery, such as chip reset.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to cause a chip recovery. This could be triggered by various factors including issues with the device."
