Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-0926.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on tag names within the Custom Permalinks plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Inadequate sanitization of user-provided input (tag names).
- Lack of output escaping on tag names when displayed in the plugin's admin interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the WordPress site.
- The injected scripts will execute when a user accesses an affected page, including the plugin's admin interface.
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Unauthorized actions on the site
  - Data theft
  - Site defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- An authenticated user with editor-level permissions or greater is required.
- The attacker creates or edits a tag, inserting malicious JavaScript code into the tag's name field.
- When an administrator or editor visits the "Custom Permalinks->Taxonomy Permalinks" page and hovers the mouse over the tag title, the injected JavaScript will execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user with at least editor-level privileges in WordPress.
- Ability to create or edit tags in the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Custom Permalinks plugin versions up to and including 2.6.0.
- The issue was addressed in version 2.7.0 of the plugin.
- The fix involved implementing proper output escaping using `esc_html` and `esc_attr` functions in `class-custom-permalinks-taxonomies-table.php` and `class-custom-permalinks-post-types-table.php` files. This prevents the injected HTML/Javascript code from being executed when displayed on the page.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even when 'unfiltered_html' is disabled.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by a researcher from Wordfence.
