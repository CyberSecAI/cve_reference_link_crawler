### Description

The SEOPress – On-site SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the image alt parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.5.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access or higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
