## 1.0 Whatâs New?

eDirectory 9.2 SP6 provides the following key features, enhancements, and fixes in this release:

### 1.1 New Features

eDirectory 9.2 SP6 adds support for eDirectory Container deployment on Microsoft Azure container instance. The deployment process is simple and time efficient. The eDirectory container is pushed into the registry as Docker image that is self-contained and capable of running on its own. For more information, see [Deploying eDirectory Container on Microsoft Azure Container Instance](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_install/data/edirectory-container-on-azure.html) in the [NetIQ eDirectory Installation Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_install/data/bookinfo.html).

### 1.2 Updates for Dependent Components

This release adds support for the following third-party components:

* OpenSSL 1.0.2za
* OpenLDAP SDK 2.4.59

### 1.3 Operating System Support

In addition to the operating systems supported in previous versions of eDirectory, this release adds support for the following:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.5
* Windows Server 2022

### 1.4 Whatâs Deprecated for Removal?

Novell Audit Platform Agent is deprecated as of eDirectory 9.2 SP6 version. NetIQ recommends that you move to CEF module for auditing services. For more information, see [Auditing with CEF](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_admin/data/t44e7j6b8ufi.html) in the [NetIQ eDirectory Administration Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-92/edir_admin/data/bookinfo.html).

### 1.5 Fixed Issues

eDirectory 9.2 SP6 includes the following software fixes that resolve several previous issues:

#### Resolved Security Vulnerabilities

This version of eDirectory resolves the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE):

* CVE-2021-38131
* CVE-2021-38132
* CVE-2021-38133
* CVE-2021-38135

#### Unable to Modify Dynamic Groups When the memberQueryURL has an Invalid base DN

*Fix:*
There is a new boolean flag that is set based on the base DN resolution. If the base DN resolution fails during dynamic group evaluation, the flag is set to true and the NDS error: returning partial results (-6016) is not displayed. As a result, dynamic groups can be modified to remove invalid base DN from memberQueryURL. (Defect 234857)

#### pre\_ndsd\_stop\_custom Script Missing From eDirectory Installed on SLES 12 Platform

*Fix:*
This release onward, when eDirectory is installed on SLES 12 platform, the pre\_ndsd\_stop\_custom script is created in the /opt/novell/eDirectory/sbin directory during eDirectory configuration. (Defect 236026)

#### Duplicate Messages Filling Up the ndsd.log Log File on Non-DSfW Server

*Fix:*
The dependency on the libxadsdk.so.2.0.0 and libxadnds.so.2.0.0 libraries has been removed. As a result, when starting ndsd services or configuring Domain Services for Windows (DSfW) on a non-DSfW server, eDirectory no longer displays the following message in the ndsd.log file: Method load failed: libxadnds.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. (Defect 237032)

#### eDirectory Crashes When a Dynamic Group Contains an Invalid memberQueryURL Attribute

*Fix:*
A ldap search on dynamic groups with an invalid memberQueryURL attribute will no longer lead to eDirectory to crash. A check is added to validate whether the attribute value added to dynamicGroup object during the collection of dynamic group information is correct. If the syntax is incorrect, the error -613 INVALID SYNTAX will be reported. (Bug 325131)

#### eDirectory Crashed in te\_free

*Fix:*
This issue is now resolved. eDirectory no longer crashes in te\_free. (Bug 314114)

#### -699 FATAL Error Occasionally Reported During Synchronization Operation

*Fix:*
During the synchronization process, a check is now introduced to skip the replica root ID check if it is a partition root data. As a result, the -699 FATAL error is no longer reported and synchronization functionality works as expected. (Bug 316167)

#### LDAP Searches on Trees with Nested Groups Takes a Long Time to Respond, Resulting in High CPU Utilization

*Fix:*
The ldapsearch has been updated. There is no longer a delay in response when searching eDirectory trees with many nested groups, even if the groupmember index is enabled. (Defect 367118)
