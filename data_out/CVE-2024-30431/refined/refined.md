  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts into the website.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, including redirects, advertisements, or any HTML payloads. These scripts execute when other users visit the affected website, potentially leading to various negative outcomes such as account hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into the website, likely through a user-supplied input field or parameter that isn't properly sanitized or encoded.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, which indicates that the vulnerable input is likely public or easily accessible. The attacker would require the capability to inject malicious script, likely through a parameter in an HTTP request."
