The provided content does not contain any information about CVE-2021-20479. Instead, it discusses vulnerabilities in IBM Cloud Pak System, specifically CVE-2021-36090.

Here's the information regarding CVE-2021-36090:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms during negotiation in IBM Cloud Pak System.
- TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are not disabled by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- Failure to disable older TLS versions (1.0 and 1.1) by default

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially decrypt sensitive information by exploiting the weak cryptographic algorithms and older TLS versions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks targeting the negotiation phase of communication with the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be positioned to intercept or monitor network traffic between clients and the vulnerable IBM Cloud Pak System instance.
