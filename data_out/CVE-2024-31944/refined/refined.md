- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to perform unwanted actions on their behalf while they are authenticated. The specific impact varies depending on the actions that can be triggered.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need any specific privileges but needs to trick an authenticated user into submitting a crafted request.
