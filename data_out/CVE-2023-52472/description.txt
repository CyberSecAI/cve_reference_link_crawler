In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: rsa - add a check for allocation failure

Static checkers insist that the mpi_alloc() allocation can fail so add
a check to prevent a NULL dereference.  Small allocations like this
can't actually fail in current kernels, but adding a check is very
simple and makes the static checkers happy.
