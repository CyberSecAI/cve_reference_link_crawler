The Move Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5 via the render function in includes/widgets/accordion/widget.php, includes/widgets/remote-template/widget.php, and other widget.php files. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive private, pending, and draft template data.
