Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10360

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `render` function within multiple `widget.php` files (specifically `includes/widgets/accordion/widget.php`, `includes/widgets/remote-template/widget.php`, `includes/widgets/advanced-tab/widget.php`, `includes/widgets/faq/widget.php`, and `includes/widgets/off-canvas/widget.php`) in the "Move Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. These functions were directly displaying content from Elementor templates without checking the post status (e.g., published, pending, private, draft).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin was exposing content from Elementor templates even if those templates were in 'pending', 'private', or 'draft' states. This allowed unauthorized users to see content intended to be private.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The plugin used the template ID to fetch and render content without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with Contributor-level access or higher could access sensitive template data, including unpublished content, private content, or drafts. This could lead to information disclosure, where sensitive information that was not intended to be public becomes visible to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the affected widgets render Elementor templates.
- An attacker would need to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher on the WordPress site.
- The attacker would need to manipulate the plugin's widget settings to reference the template IDs of interest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site with at least Contributor-level privileges or higher.
- The attacker doesn't need any special tools or techniques beyond those provided by the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Move Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including 1.3.5.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 1.3.6 by adding a check to ensure the template is not in 'pending', 'private', or 'draft' status before displaying it. The fix involves adding the following logic
```php
if(!in_array(get_post_status($template_id), ['pending', 'private', 'draft'])) {
    echo move_addons_get_elementor()->frontend->get_builder_content_for_display( $template_id );
} else {
    echo '<p>'.esc_html__('The post is not published yet. Make sure to publish it to view the content.', 'moveaddons').'</p>';
}
```
This check was implemented in all the affected widget files.
