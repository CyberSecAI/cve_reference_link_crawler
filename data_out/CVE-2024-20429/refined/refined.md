- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS for Secure Email Gateway.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the template, leading to command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with *root* privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device's web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid *Operator* credentials to access the vulnerable web interface.
