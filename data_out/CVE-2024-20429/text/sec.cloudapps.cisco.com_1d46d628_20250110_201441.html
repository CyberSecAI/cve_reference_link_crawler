This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in certain portions of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with *root* privileges. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need at least valid *Operator* credentials.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
