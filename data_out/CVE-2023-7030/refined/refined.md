Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7030

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `tag` attribute within the `expand` shortcode of the Collapse-O-Matic plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `tag` attribute of the `expand` shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages. When a user visits a page containing this injected code, the script will execute in their browser.
- This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious `expand` shortcode with a `tag` attribute containing a JavaScript payload.
- This malicious shortcode is then stored within the WordPress database through posts or pages.
- When a user visits a page containing the malicious shortcode, the injected script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means the attacker must have an account with the ability to create and edit posts or pages.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `expand` shortcode and the vulnerable `tag` attribute.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.8.5.5.
- The fix involves filtering the `tag`, `targtag`, and `elwrap` attributes to only allow certain tags, which is implemented in version 1.8.5.6.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Richard Telleng (stueotue).
