Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-25848:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the `EverPsSeo::hookHeader()` method of the "Ever Ultimate SEO" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `$controller_name` variable is directly embedded into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of proper sanitization of the `$controller_name` variable allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** An attacker can access sensitive information from the database.
*   **Integrity:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Availability:** An attacker could potentially disrupt the normal functioning of the PrestaShop application, potentially leading to denial of service.
*   **Specific malicious usages**:
    *   Obtain admin access.
    *   Remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
    *   Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the frontend to expose tokens and unlock adminsâ€™s ajax scripts.
    *   Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a network attack via HTTP requests.
*   The vulnerable code is triggered by a PrestaShop hook that is executed on all pages of the website, which means an attacker can trigger it with an arbitrary request like "POST /".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **No user interaction required:** The exploit can be performed without any user interaction.
*   An attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.

**Additional details from the advisory:**
*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 7.13.4 for PrestaShop 1.6 and <= 8.1.2 for PrestaShop 1.7+.
*   The fix involves using the `pSQL()` function to sanitize the `$controller_name` variable before it is used in SQL queries.
*   The advisory also provides recommendations, including upgrading to the latest version of the module, using a strong database prefix and activating WAF rules.
*  The exploit can be concealed because it only appears as a POST request to the homepage within standard logs.
