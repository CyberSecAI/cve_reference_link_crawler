Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple format string bugs ([CWE-134](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html)) exist within the command line interpreter (CLI) and `httpd` processes of various Fortinet products. These vulnerabilities occur when user-provided input is used directly as a format string in functions like `printf` or `sprintf`, allowing an attacker to potentially control the format string arguments.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Format string vulnerabilities in CLI and `httpd` processes.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting these format string bugs via crafted commands or HTTP requests. This would allow them to execute unauthorized code or commands on the affected system.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Specifically crafted commands via the CLI.
    *   Specifically crafted HTTP requests to the `httpd` process.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the system. This is mentioned in the summary that "an authenticated attacker".
    *   The attacker also requires the ability to send malicious CLI commands or HTTP requests to the vulnerable devices

The document also provides a list of affected products and versions, along with the fixes. It also mentions FortiSASE as having been remediated in Q3/23.

This information is more detailed than a placeholder description, and it directly relates to CVE-2023-36640 (and CVE-2023-45583, which is included in the document as well).
