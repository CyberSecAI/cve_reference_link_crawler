- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write leading to a write-what-where condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** System execution privileges are required. User interaction is not needed.
