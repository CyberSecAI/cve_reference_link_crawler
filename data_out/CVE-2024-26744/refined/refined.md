Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26744:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26744, as it is mentioned in the security advisories for both `linux-5.10` and `linux` packages.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `ib_srpt` module related to handling the `srpt_service_guid` parameter during module loading. The module did not correctly handle the parameter when it was set, causing a null pointer dereference. This was due to a missing setter function for the parameter.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary weakness is a null pointer dereference, which leads to a kernel crash.
- **Improper Parameter Handling:**  The module's `module_param_call` macro lacked a proper setter function, specifically when parsing the `srpt_service_guid` parameter.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service condition. The system becomes unusable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Module Loading:** The vulnerability is triggered when loading the `ib_srpt` module with the `srpt_service_guid` parameter specified.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged Access:** The attacker would need the capability to load kernel modules, which typically requires root or administrative privileges.
- **Module Loading:** The attacker would need to load `ib_srpt` with a specific parameter.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability was caused by the `module_param_call` macro definition for `srpt_service_guid` not including a setter callback function. It only specified a getter, leading to a null pointer dereference when trying to parse the parameter during module load.

The fix involved adding a setter callback function, specifically `srpt_set_u64_x`, which uses `kstrtou64` to parse the hexadecimal value provided through the parameter and sets the internal `srpt_service_guid` variable.

```c
static int srpt_set_u64_x(const char *buffer, const struct kernel_param *kp)
{
    return kstrtou64(buffer, 16, (u64 *)kp->arg);
}

static int srpt_get_u64_x(char *buffer, const struct kernel_param *kp)
{
    return sprintf(buffer, "0x%016llx\n", *(u64 *)kp->arg);
}

module_param_call(srpt_service_guid, srpt_set_u64_x, srpt_get_u64_x,
                 &srpt_service_guid, 0444);

```
The patch addresses this issue by providing the `srpt_set_u64_x` function as a setter, which parses the hexadecimal string to a u64 value.
