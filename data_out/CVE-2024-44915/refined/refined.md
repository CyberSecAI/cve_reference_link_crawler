The provided content details three distinct vulnerabilities found in the IrfanView image viewer, specifically within the `Exr.dll` plugin. All three vulnerabilities are triggered by opening specially crafted `.exr` files, leading to access violation errors.

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root Cause:** An attempt to write to an invalid memory location.
*   **Weakness:** Access violation due to an invalid memory write operation.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the IrfanView application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Opening a malicious `.exr` file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or obtain a specially crafted `.exr` file and induce a user to open it with the vulnerable IrfanView version.
*   **Technical Details:** The crash occurs at `EXR!ReadEXR+0x40ef1`, where the instruction `mov word ptr [r9],ax` attempts to write to an invalid address (`000001ea00d1f6f6`).

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root Cause:**  An attempt to write to an invalid memory location using non-temporal store.
*   **Weakness:** Access violation due to an invalid memory write operation.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the IrfanView application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Opening a malicious `.exr` file.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or obtain a specially crafted `.exr` file and induce a user to open it with the vulnerable IrfanView version.
*   **Technical Details:** The crash occurs at `EXR!ReadEXR+0x4eef0` where instruction `movntdq xmmword ptr [rcx],xmm0` attempts to write to invalid address `000051ea12af6480`.

**Vulnerability 3**

*   **Root Cause:** An attempt to write to an invalid memory location.
*   **Weakness:** Access violation due to an invalid memory write operation.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the IrfanView application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Opening a malicious `.exr` file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or obtain a specially crafted `.exr` file and induce a user to open it with the vulnerable IrfanView version.
*    **Technical Details:** The crash occurs at `EXR!ReadEXR+0x3df50` where the instruction `mov word ptr [rdi],ax` attempts to write to an invalid address (`00000234aa95adc6`).

**Common details for all three vulnerabilities:**

*   **Affected Product:** IrfanView version 4.67 with `Exr.dll` plugin version 4.67.1.0.
*   **Vulnerable File Extension:** `.exr`.
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Access violation.
*   **Plugin:** `Exr.dll` is the root cause of the vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploitation**: By opening a malformed `.exr` file crafted to trigger specific code paths within the `Exr.dll` plugin.
