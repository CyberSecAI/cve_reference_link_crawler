- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An uncaught exception in the FCS Server software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly handle exceptions, leading to a potential denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack could lead to a denial of service of the FCS server software.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the vulnerable system is required, and the attacker must be a privileged user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the system and must have privileged user status. Additionally, the attacker needs to trigger a specific condition that causes an uncaught exception.
