- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `sgpb-subscription-popup-id` parameter was not sanitized and escaped before being used in a SQL statement within the All Subscribers admin dashboard of the Popup Builder plugin.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The unsanitized parameter allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can also occur as a result of the SQL injection.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries. If a logged-in admin clicks a malicious link, the injected SQL can lead to a reflected XSS attack. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the admin's session, leading to actions like session hijacking, or admin manipulation.

- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted URL containing the vulnerable parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to create a malicious link with a crafted `sgpb-subscription-popup-id` parameter.
    - The attacker needs to convince a logged-in admin to visit the malicious link.
