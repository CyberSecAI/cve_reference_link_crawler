Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-26137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause additional Servlet Filters to be invoked when the application processes requests or responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Additional Servlet Filter Invocation:** The core weakness is the application's failure to properly control which Servlet Filters are invoked during request processing. This allows an attacker to trigger the execution of filters beyond what is normally intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CORS Bypass:** The documented impact is the ability to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. This allows an attacker to potentially access the application with the permissions of a user who has interacted with a malicious URL provided by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted HTTP request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
- **Malicious URL:** Attackers need to trick a user into requesting a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not require prior access to the vulnerable application or any specific user credentials.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to create and send malicious HTTP requests.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing a malicious URL.
