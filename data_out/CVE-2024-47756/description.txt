In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: keystone: Fix if-statement expression in ks_pcie_quirk()

This code accidentally uses && where || was intended.  It potentially
results in a NULL dereference.

Thus, fix the if-statement expression to use the correct condition.
