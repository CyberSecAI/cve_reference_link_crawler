Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control in the `/user/updatePassword` endpoint. It allows an authenticated user to change the password of any other user by providing the target user's `userId` parameter, which is vulnerable to tampering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The application fails to verify if the authenticated user is authorized to change the password of the specified `userId`.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The `userId` parameter allows direct manipulation to affect other users' accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can change the password of any user, including privileged accounts, gaining complete control over those accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user in the OvalEdge application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OvalEdge application.
