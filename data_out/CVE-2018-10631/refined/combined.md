## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 5 --------**

* **CVSS v3 6.3**

**--------- End Update A Part 1 of 5 -----------**

* **ATTENTION:** Low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** Medtronic
* **Equipment:** N’Vision Clinician Programmer

**--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 5 -----------**

* **Vulnerabilities:** Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, Protection Mechanism Failure

**--------- End Update A Part 2 of 5 -----------**
## 2. UPDATE INFORMATION

This updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSMA-18-137-01 Medtronic N'Vision Clinician Programmer that was published May 17, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT website.

## 3. RISK EVALUATION

As part of the normal functionality of this device, the N’Vision Clinician Programmer may store Personal Health Information (PHI) or Personal Identifying Information (PII). Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker with physical access to an 8870 N’Vision Compact Flash card to access this PHI or PII.

**--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 5 --------**

Additionally, an attacker with physical access to the 8870 Application Card may be able to modify the card to execute arbitrary code on the 8840 Clinician Programmer.

**--------- End Update A Part 3 of 5 -----------**
## 4. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

**--------- Begin Update A Part 4 of 5 --------**

The N’Vision Clinician Programmer is a small, portable device that offers a single programming platform for Medtronic Neurological implantable therapy devices, such as Medtronic neurostimulators and drug pumps. The following products are affected:

**--------- End Update A Part 4 of 5 -----------**

* 8840 N’Vision Clinician Programmer, all versions, and
* 8870 N’Vision removable Application Card, all versions.

### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### 4.2.1   [MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html)

The affected product does not encrypt the following sensitive information while at rest:

* PII – Personally Identifiable Information. Some combination of personal data that enables the unique identification of an individual. PII is defined as “information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.”
* PHI – Protected Health Information. Some combination of PII and associated health related data.

[CVE-2018-8849](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-8849) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

**--------- Begin Update A Part 5 of 5 --------**

### 4.2.2    [PROTECTION MECHANISM FAILURE CWE-693](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)

The 8840 Clinician Programmer executes the application program from the 8870 Application Card. An attacker with physical access to an 8870 Application Card and sufficient technical capability can modify the contents of this card, including the binary executables. If modified to bypass protection mechanisms, this malicious code will be run when the card is inserted into an 8840 Clinician Programmer.

[CVE-2018-10631](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-10631) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**--------- End Update A Part 5 of 5 -----------**

### 4.3 BACKGROUND

* **Critical Infrastructure Sectors:** Healthcare and Public Health
* **Countries/Areas Deployed:** Worldwide
* **Company Headquarters Location:** Dublin, Ireland

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts of Whitescope LLC reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Medtronic has not developed a product update to address the vulnerabilities, but is reinforcing security reminders within this advisory to help reduce the risk associated with the vulnerabilities.

The 8870 Therapy Application card stores PHI and PII as part of its normal operating procedure and should be handled, managed and secured in a manner consistent with the applicable laws for patient data privacy.

Medtronic recommends users take additional defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, hospitals and clinicians should:

* Maintain strict physical control of the 8870 application card.
* Use only legitimately obtained 8870 cards and not cards provided by any third party as firmware and system updates are provided directly by Medtronic using new 8870 application cards.
* 8840 Programmers and 8870 Therapy Application compact flash cards are the property of Medtronic and should be returned to Medtronic when no longer in use. If that is not an option, you should securely dispose of them.

Medtronic has released additional patient focused information, at the following location:

<https://www.medtronic.com/security>

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.

Commitment to Security

![A photo of a female scientist using a lab machine.](/content/dam/medtronic-wide/public/brand-corporate-assets/imagery/lifestyle/general/our-impact-hero-life.jpg)

# Commitment to security

At Medtronic, nothing is more important than the safety of our patients. Medtronic designs and manufactures our lifesaving medical technologies to be as safe and secure as possible. Our Global Product Security Office continuously monitors the evolving product and cybersecurity landscape to address vulnerabilities and takes action to protect patients through a coordinated disclosure process.

Medical devices are potential targets of cyberattacks, and we anticipate those risks to increase and evolve over time. However, Medtronic firmly believes that the therapeutic benefits of our products far outweigh any potential security risks. We continuously monitor the ongoing security of our products and operations and take appropriate action to address vulnerabilities.

## Product security

Medtronic’s Global Product Security Office approach is two-fold:

* We embed subject-matter security experts within each operating unit. The product security program practices are executed by security subject matter experts within the businesses and are supported by an enterprise-wide, cross-functional team. This enables Medtronic to embed security considerations into the full product lifecycle. This structure provides product security governance and oversight and allows for the establishment of policies and procedures that apply across our wide range of therapies and geographies. Additionally, the product security program is supported by rigorous quality processes managed by our Enterprise Quality organization.
* We have an integrated enterprise-wide security team that works across the entire organization. The Product Security Office is integrated into Medtronic’s Enterprise Quality organization. This team works cross-functionally across the business to provide broad security expertise, governance, and oversight on product security issues. They proactively share information to foster a culture of learning and best practices across a global organization and augment the security experts within each business unit by providing resources to conduct independent and expert security consultation. Additionally, the team oversees and manages the coordinated vulnerability disclosure program.

Externally, Medtronic works closely with government agencies, industry partners, security researchers, trade associations, subject matter working groups, business partners, and vendors to enhance security efforts across the medical device and healthcare industry and to inform and shape the guidance and regulatory landscape.

## Information security

![Two male employees look at the same computer screen.](/content/dam/medtronic-wide/public/imagery-low-resolution/people/employee-lifestyle/art-photo-EL-1-MDT-Sit-T-Morley-A-Kamzin-7-030-jpg.jpg.thumb.450.750.jpg)

Protecting information is critically important to Medtronic. We have strong processes, technologies, and people in place to safeguard and to protect our information and systems, the information of our business partners, and most importantly, the privacy and safety of the patients and healthcare providers that use our products.

While no system of security can provide 100 percent protection, we take a layered approach to security with dedicated resources and processes to help prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.

We align our oversight and management of infrastructure cybersecurity based on the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission’s 27000 series (ISO/IEC 27000) and to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. We have compliance and development programs in place for the healthcare technology devices, systems, and services we sell consistent with applicable medical device regulatory requirements, some of which are listed below:

* Governing laws, standards, and compliance requirements
* Architecture and standards
* Security operations/intelligence
* Physical security
* Human factors and privacy/security culture
* Communications and network security
* Product and device security
