  "CVE-2019-2842": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The Java Cryptography Extension component in OpenJDK did not properly perform array bounds checking in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper array bounds checking in the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) component of OpenJDK.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper array bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause the application or service using the vulnerable OpenJDK to crash or become unresponsive.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "Specially crafted input",
         "Network access to a vulnerable service using JCE functions"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a specific input to trigger the array bounds check failure within the JCE component. This input is then used against the vulnerable application which is using the OpenJDK component.",

        "OpenJDK",
         "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)"
