- Root cause of vulnerability: The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who has low privileges and can convince a victim to interact with the crafted payload.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to store malicious scripts in the application, and a victim needs to interact with the stored payload by visiting a page containing the malicious scripts. The attacker needs low privileges within the application to store the malicious scripts.
