**Please specify the area for this PR**

Vulnerability fixes

**What does does this PR do / why we need it**:

This PR aims to add a fix that ensures no malicious files can be added to an `archive.tar` file that is being read. Currently the `filepath.Join` and `filepath.Clean` functions are not properly accounting for paths added in a relative fashion (ie. "../../filename") and only properly cleans file paths that start with a leading slash. This fix adds that leading slash to all filepaths (relative or absolute) before the cleaning process, this ensures that no filepath can leave the confines of its parent by escaping out. The cleaning process removes any redundant double slashes that may arise because we are prepending the leading slash.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**:

No public issue

With this fix, we should try removing the following line to enforce the safety of this with gosec: <https://github.com/Jdubrick/registry-support/blob/10b01bc136bd082f59b1ac0c91797f4065792d7b/registry-library/library/util.go#L125>
