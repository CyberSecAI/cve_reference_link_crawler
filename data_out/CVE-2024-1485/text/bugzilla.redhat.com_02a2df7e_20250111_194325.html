| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2264106#c0)  Nick Tait    2024-02-13 21:58:36 UTC  ``` This vulnerability affects <https://github.com/devfile/registry-support> and more specifically as part of a decompress function where we were reading archived files from a .tar and writing them to a new location. It was reported to us that the cleaning function we were using to ensure the file paths could not escape the directory they were supposed to go to was not working properly. This allowed somebody to potentially intercept the .tar file as it was being downloaded by the client and replace it with one that contained relative file paths. These paths when read by the decompress function would escape the destination directory and potentially overwrite arbitrary files.  The commit that contains the fix is here: <https://github.com/devfile/registry-support/commit/0e44b9ca6d03fac4fc3f77d37656d56dc5defe0d>   ``` |  |
