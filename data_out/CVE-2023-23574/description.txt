A blind SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC, due to improper input validation in the alerts_count component, allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the DBMS used by the web application.

Authenticated users may be able to extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way, alter its structure and data, and/or affect its availability.
