Here's the breakdown of the relevant vulnerability:

**SVE-2022-0258(CVE-2022-30717): Improper caller check in AR Emoji**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** An improper caller check within the AR Emoji application allows unauthorized access to camera functions via deeplinks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Caller Check:** The AR Emoji application doesn't adequately verify the source of requests when accessing camera functions through deeplinks.
    *   **Deeplink Exploitation:** Vulnerability stems from how AR Emoji handles deeplinks, which are used to navigate directly to specific parts of the app.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Untrusted applications can potentially utilize this vulnerability to gain access to and use some camera functionalities of the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious application exploits this vulnerability by crafting and sending a deeplink intended to trigger camera functionality within AR Emoji, without proper authorization.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. They also need to know how to construct the appropriate deeplink for the specific camera features they wish to access via the AR Emoji application.

The fix for this vulnerability removes the insecure deeplink operations to prevent unauthorized access to camera functionalities.
