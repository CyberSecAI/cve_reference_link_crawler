### @potiuk **[potiuk](/potiuk)** commented [Aug 4, 2023](#issue-1836484593)

This change add two options to choose from when SSL IMAP connection is created:

* default - for balance between compatibility and security
* none - in case compatibility with existing infrastructure is preferred

The fallback is:

* The Airflow "email", "ssl\_context"
* "default"

Message-ID: <0227aa7c-d06f-93d7-34f2-931d922c0c53@apache.org>
Date: Wed, 23 Aug 2023 10:33:16 +0000
From: Ephraim Anierobi <ephraimanierobi@...che.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2023-39441: Apache Airflow SMTP Provider, Apache Airflow IMAP
 Provider, Apache Airflow: SMTP/IMAP client components allowed MITM due to
 missing Certificate Validation

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow SMTP Provider before 1.30
- Apache Airflow IMAP Provider before 3.3.0
- Apache Airflow before 2.7.0

Description:

Apache Airflow SMTP Provider before 1.3.0, Apache Airflow IMAP Provider before 3.3.0, and Apache Airflow before 2.7.0 are affected by the Validation of OpenSSL Certificate vulnerability.

The default SSL context with SSL library did not check a server's X.509 certificate.  Instead, the code accepted any certificate, which could result in the disclosure of mail server credentials or mail contents when the client connects to an attacker in a MITM position.

Users are strongly advised to upgrade to Apache Airflow version 2.7.0 or newer, Apache Airflow IMAP Provider version 3.3.0 or newer, and Apache Airflow SMTP Provider version 1.3.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability

This change add two options to choose from when SSL SMTP connection is created:

* default - for balance between compatibility and security

The fallback is:

* The Airflow "email", "ssl\_context"
* "default"

| Also for [@hussein-awala](https://github.com/hussein-awala) -> I am not sure if this approach is best and how it will work with [#30531](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30531) - I just figured that we have to use "smtp\_provider" section rather than "smtp" from the core - and I think we should follow similar approach like here - where "smtp" will go to "pre\_2\_7\_0" defaults, but the provider will use the "smtp\_provider" section and fall back to the "smtp" one, similarly as I am falling back now to "email" / "ssl\_context" - would love to hear from you on that one.  As explained above, I am trying to make chain of defaults this way and added unit tests covering the behaviour |

| [@hussein-awala](https://github.com/hussein-awala) -> would you like to comment on that one, re [#30531](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30531) - or you are ok for now. I'd love to merge that one and implement IMAP change as well so that we can release new providers today :) |

| I'm late to the party.  I just figured that we have to use "smtp\_provider" section rather than "smtp" from the core - and I think we should follow similar approach like here - where "smtp" will go to "pre\_2\_7\_0" defaults, but the provider will use the "smtp\_provider" section and fall back to the "smtp" one, similarly as I am falling back now to "email" / "ssl\_context" - would love to hear from you on that one.  For smtp\_provider, I think it would be better to use the connection extras to configure ssl\_context (as we do with the other configurations), instead of using Airlfow config (or even provider config). <https://github.com/potiuk/airflow/blob/ca2f3013bcb123c4b3973a5b85de77094bf2c459/airflow/providers/smtp/hooks/smtp.py#L321-L355>  Since we cannot use the operator/hook without a connection, IMO it's better if we provide a single way to configure them.  WDYT? could we move this conf to the connection before releasing the provider? |

This change add two options to choose from when SSL SMTP connection
is created:

* default - for balance between compatibility and security
* none - in case compatibility with existing infrastructure is
  preferred

The fallback is:

* The Airflow \"email\", \"ssl_context\"
* \"default\"

* Update airflow/providers/smtp/CHANGELOG.rst
