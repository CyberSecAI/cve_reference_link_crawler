### @potiuk **[potiuk](/potiuk)** commented [Aug 4, 2023](#issue-1836484593)

This change add two options to choose from when SSL IMAP connection is created:

* default - for balance between compatibility and security
* none - in case compatibility with existing infrastructure is preferred

The fallback is:

* The Airflow "email", "ssl\_context"
* "default"
