### @potiuk **[potiuk](/potiuk)** commented [Aug 3, 2023](#issue-1835257691)

This change add two options to choose from when SSL SMTP connection is created:

* default - for balance between compatibility and security
* none - in case compatibility with existing infrastructure is   preferred

The fallback is:

* The Airflow "email", "ssl\_context"
* "default"

| Also for [@hussein-awala](https://github.com/hussein-awala) -> I am not sure if this approach is best and how it will work with [#30531](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30531) - I just figured that we have to use "smtp\_provider" section rather than "smtp" from the core - and I think we should follow similar approach like here - where "smtp" will go to "pre\_2\_7\_0" defaults, but the provider will use the "smtp\_provider" section and fall back to the "smtp" one, similarly as I am falling back now to "email" / "ssl\_context" - would love to hear from you on that one.  As explained above, I am trying to make chain of defaults this way and added unit tests covering the behaviour |

| I'm late to the party.  I just figured that we have to use "smtp\_provider" section rather than "smtp" from the core - and I think we should follow similar approach like here - where "smtp" will go to "pre\_2\_7\_0" defaults, but the provider will use the "smtp\_provider" section and fall back to the "smtp" one, similarly as I am falling back now to "email" / "ssl\_context" - would love to hear from you on that one.  For smtp\_provider, I think it would be better to use the connection extras to configure ssl\_context (as we do with the other configurations), instead of using Airlfow config (or even provider config). <https://github.com/potiuk/airflow/blob/ca2f3013bcb123c4b3973a5b85de77094bf2c459/airflow/providers/smtp/hooks/smtp.py#L321-L355>  Since we cannot use the operator/hook without a connection, IMO it's better if we provide a single way to configure them.  WDYT? could we move this conf to the connection before releasing the provider? |

This change add two options to choose from when SSL SMTP connection
is created:

* default - for balance between compatibility and security
* none - in case compatibility with existing infrastructure is
  preferred

The fallback is:

* The Airflow "email", "ssl_context"
* "default"

* Update airflow/providers/smtp/CHANGELOG.rst
