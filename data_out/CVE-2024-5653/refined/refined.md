Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and filtering within the `keyEdit.aspx` interface of the Chanjet Smooth T+ system. Specifically, user-supplied input to the `KeyID` parameter isn't sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `KeyID` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including administrator passwords and user information.
*   **Server Compromise:** In high-privilege scenarios, attackers can potentially write malicious files (Trojans) to the server, leading to further control and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `keyEdit.aspx` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The `KeyID` parameter is the entry point for the injected SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameter is `KeyID` in the URL `tplus/UFAQD/keyEdit.aspx`.
*   A sample exploit is provided:
    ```
    GET /tplus/UFAQD/keyEdit.aspx?KeyID=1%27%20and%201=(select%20@@version)%20--&preload=1 HTTP/1.1
    ```
*   The report mentions that the attacker can not only get information but also potentially upload a trojan.

**Affected Version:**
*   Chanjet Smooth T+ system V3.5.
