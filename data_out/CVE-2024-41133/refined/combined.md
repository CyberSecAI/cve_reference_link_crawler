Authenticated Remote Command Execution in the HPE Aruba Networking
EdgeConnect SD-WAN SSH Daemon
(CVE-2023-51385)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if
a username or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name
is referenced by an expansion token in certain situations. For
example, an untrusted Git repository can have a submodule with
shell metacharacters in a username or hostname. The impact of this
vulnerability on HPE Aruba Networking EdgeConnect SD-WAN has not
been confirmed, but the version of OpenSSH has been upgraded for
mitigation. HPE Aruba Networking is not aware of any malicious
exploitation of this vulnerability.
Internal Reference: ATLSP-107
Severity: Medium
CVSSv3 Overall Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
Discovery: This vulnerability was originally reported by Vinci.
Further details can be found at:
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51385
Resolution: HPE Aruba Networking has patched this particular
vulnerability in the following branches and versions of
ECOS:
- ECOS 9.4.x: ECOS 9.4.2.0 (all builds) and above

Workaround: Refer to the general Workaround section, found towards
the bottom of the advisory.
Terrapin Attack Vulnerability in OpenSSH Impacting HPE Aruba
Networking EdgeConnect SD-WAN
(CVE-2023-48795)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found
in OpenSSH before 9.6 allows remote attackers to bypass integrity
checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension
negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end
up with a connection for which some security features have been
downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. The impact of this
vulnerability on HPE Aruba Networking EdgeConnect SD-WAN gateways
has not been confirmed, but the version of OpenSSH in ECOS software
has been upgraded for mitigation.
Internal references: ATLSP-109
Severity: Medium
CVSSv3 Overall Score: 5.9
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
Discovery: This vulnerability was discovered by Fabian BÃ¤umer,
Marcus Brinkmann, and JÃ¶rg Schwenk
Further details can be found at:
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795
Resolution: HPE Aruba Networking has patched this particular
vulnerability in the following branches and versions of

Resolution
==========
HPE Aruba Networking advises customers to upgrade to the following
versions to address all vulnerabilities within this advisory, unless
otherwise specified in the Details section. These builds and branches
will fix the lower severity authenticated vulnerabilities that require
existing administrative access:
- ECOS 9.5.x: ECOS 9.5.0.0 (all builds) and above
- ECOS 9.4.x: ECOS 9.4.2.0 (all builds) and above
- ECOS 9.3.x: ECOS 9.3.4.0 (all builds) and above
The EdgeConnect SD-WAN Orchestrator software version must be greater
than or equal to the ECOS software version running on any EdgeConnect
SD-WAN gateways.
HPE Aruba Networking does not evaluate or patch software versions that
have reached their End of Maintenance (EoM) milestone.
Maintained versions as of the publication date of this advisory
are:
- HPE Aruba Networking EdgeConnect SD-WAN 9.5.x.x
- HPE Aruba Networking EdgeConnect SD-WAN 9.4.x.x
- HPE Aruba Networking EdgeConnect SD-WAN 9.3.x.x
- HPE Aruba Networking EdgeConnect SD-WAN 9.2.x.x

Workaround
==========
To minimize the likelihood of an attacker exploiting these
vulnerabilities, HPE Aruba Networking recommends that the CLI
and web-based management interfaces be restricted to a dedicated
layer 2 segment/VLAN and/or controlled by firewall policies at
layer 3 and above. As a best practice, it is recommended to
configure IP-allow-listing for Orchestrator local users and API
Keys.
In EdgeConnect SD-WAN deployments, it is recommended that RADIUS and
TACACS management plane traffic be engineered to use the secure SD-WAN
tunnels for transport to the extent possible.

==================================
CVE-2023-51385 and CVE-2023-48795 are being widely discussed in
public. HPE Aruba Networking is not aware of any exploitation tools or
techniques that specifically target HPE Aruba Networking products.
HPE Aruba Networking is not aware of any public discussion or exploit
