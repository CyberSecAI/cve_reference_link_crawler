- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FortiTray process within FortiClient for Mac stores the SSL-VPN password in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200), specifically the SSL-VPN password being stored in cleartext.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local, authenticated attacker can obtain the cleartext SSL-VPN password by running a log stream for the FortiTray process in the terminal. This is an information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs local access to the machine where FortiClient for Mac is installed, and must be able to execute commands in the terminal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local, authenticated user on the macOS system.
