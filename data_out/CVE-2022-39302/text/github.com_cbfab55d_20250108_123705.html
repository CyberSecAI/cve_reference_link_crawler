# Cross-Server-Channel Exploit

High

[DxsSucuk](/DxsSucuk)
published
GHSA-v574-xgcf-5w8x
Oct 12, 2022

## Package

maven

Ree6
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.9.9

## Patched versions

1.9.9 >=

## Description

### Impact

This "Exploit" would allow other Server owners to create configurations such as "Better-Audit-Logging" which contain a channel from another Server as target.This would mean you could send log messages to another Servers channel. This would allow you to send your servers Log event to another Servers channel, which can be used to bypass raid and spam protections incase of a specificly crafted Log-Message, which would allow mention spamming and mass advertisment.

### Patches

This Issue has been patched in 1.9.9

### Workarounds

There sadly is no workaround.

You will need to upgrade to a newer version!

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
