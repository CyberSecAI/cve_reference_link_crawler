Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the MariaDB database of the affected web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798 "Use of Hard-coded Credentials":** The application's database is accessible via credentials that are embedded in the software, rather than being securely generated or managed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain access to the MariaDB database.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can manipulate any data within the database with the same privileges as the web application.
- **Arbitrary Device Configuration Changes:** The attacker can make arbitrary changes to the device's configuration, which could lead to a variety of impacts depending on the device's function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and no authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs network access to the device running the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication or specialized access to the system is needed.

**Affected Product:**
- AiLux imx6 bundle below version imx6_1.0.7-2

**CVSS Score:**
- 8.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Solution:**
