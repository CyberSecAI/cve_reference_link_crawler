| Hi,  I would like to report another potential vulnerability in the current version of RT-Thread. Please let me know if you plan to ask for a CVE ID in case the vulnerability is confirmed. I'm available if you need further clarifications. Potential stack buffer overflow in RT-Thread IPCSummary I spotted a potential stack buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location in the RT-Thread IPC source code: <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/libc/posix/ipc/mqueue.c#L278> Details Unbounded `rt_sprintf()` in the `mq_unlink()` function could lead to a stack buffer overflow at the marked line:  ``` int mq_unlink(const char *name) {     if(*name == '/')     {         name++;     }     const char *mq_path = "/dev/mqueue/";     char mq_name[RT_NAME_MAX + 12] = {0};     rt_sprintf(mq_name, "%s%s", mq_path, name); /* VULN: stack buffer overflow */     return unlink(mq_name); } ```  Please note that the `mq_open()` function at <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/libc/posix/ipc/mqueue.c#L65-L70> implements bound checking:  ```     int len = rt_strlen(name);     if (len > RT_NAME_MAX)     {         rt_set_errno(ENAMETOOLONG);         return (mqd_t)(-1);     } ``` Impact If the unchecked input above is confirmed to be attacker-controlled and crossing a security boundary, the impact of the reported buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. |

| Hi, it's been one month since I reported this vulnerability, and I wanted to ask if you have any update. As standard practice, I plan to request a CVE ID for every confirmed vulnerability. I also intend to publish an advisory by February at the latest, unless there's a specific reason to postpone. Thanks! |

| I got here from the article on HaD - but looking at the code above it is unclear if it is or isn't a really big problem... In this case "char mq\_name[RT\_NAME\_MAX + 12]" sets the memory being copied to - where the 12 is the path length of the line before (by the way, using a '12' here is bad coding practice and could lead to problems later..) so as long as the "name" being passed in has been checked against RT\_NAME\_MAX things might still be ok - though badly written.  Looking around RT\_NAME\_MAX is 8, and the routine calling this routine does no checking. Indeed the example code []   [rt-thread/examples/libc/mq.c](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/b85c4cade2cd730305e66c9c215a8c8e53c20e95/examples/libc/mq.c#L123)  Line 123 in [b85c4ca](/RT-Thread/rt-thread/commit/b85c4cade2cd730305e66c9c215a8c8e53c20e95)   |  | mq\_unlink(MQ\_NAME\_2); | | --- | --- |    calls it with   ``` #define MQ_NAME_1       "testmsg1" #define MQ_NAME_2       "testmsg2"   ```  Which are 8 bytes long (plus a EOS). Plus the path which is 12. Plus the EOS which is 1. = 21bytes. Ooops, the buffer has overrun even with the example code.  So yes, it is a problem. I simply can't understand why people write code like the above (problem) code - there has been no point in the development of C that such code would have been either acceptable or pass any type of quality control, let alone actual testing.. |
