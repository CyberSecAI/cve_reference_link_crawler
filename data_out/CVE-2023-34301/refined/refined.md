- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the parsing of CO files in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. The issue stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it is dereferenced as a pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of user-supplied values leading to an untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious CO file or webpage. The target must either open a malicious CO file or visit a malicious webpage containing the exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious CO file or webpage. User interaction is required, where the target must open the malicious file or visit the malicious webpage.
