```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` endpoint is vulnerable to arbitrary file read due to lack of sanitization of the `fileName` body parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary File Read, potentially leading to the compromise of the confidentiality of information on the host server, allowing attackers to read files from the Flowise server and potentially read/modify user secrets.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to the `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` endpoint with a crafted `fileName` parameter in the request body.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Flowise server. No specific position is specified, but the attacker would need network access to the server."
