- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a combination of two weaknesses:
    - The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key in FortiClientEMS (CWE-321).
    - Improper certificate validation in FortiClient for Windows, Linux and macOS (CWE-297).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CWE-321: Use of hard-coded cryptographic key.
    - CWE-297: Improper certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A network-adjacent attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack between the FortiClientEMS server and FortiClient endpoints, potentially gaining unauthorized access, modifying data, or disrupting communications.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted via the telemetry protocol. The attacker must be network-adjacent to the communication between EMS and FortiClient.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker that is network-adjacent to the communication between the EMS and the FCT (FortiClient).
