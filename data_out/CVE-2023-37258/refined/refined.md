Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application suffers from a SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the `orders` parameter of the `/app/log/logGrid` endpoint. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the use of `${}` symbol in the SQL query construction combined with insufficient input validation, which allows an attacker to bypass the implemented blacklist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability. User-provided input (specifically, the `orders` parameter) is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.
- **Insufficient Blacklisting:** The application attempts to prevent SQL injection via a blacklist, however this blacklist was bypassed using `GTID_SUBTRACT` function.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The `orders` parameter should be validated to prevent it from containing anything other than the expected values, but this is not enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database by crafting malicious SQL queries.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database configuration and privileges of the user context, an attacker might be able to perform privileged actions on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP POST request to the `/app/log/logGrid` endpoint.
- The malicious SQL injection is injected through the `orders` parameter, which is a JSON array.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, and have a valid JWT token.
- No special privileges on the system are explicitly stated in the content, only a valid `Authorization` token.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.18.8 of the `dataease` application.
- The issue was fixed in version 1.18.9.
- The provided code snippets show the location in the code where the vulnerability exists. The code also shows how the blacklist was bypassed by using the `GTID_SUBTRACT` function.
