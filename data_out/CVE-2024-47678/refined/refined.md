{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ICMP rate limiting mechanism applied host-wide limits before per-destination limits, which is susceptible to side-channel attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect order of rate limit checks allows side-channel attacks by potentially leaking information about specific destinations.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially leverage the incorrect order of rate limiting checks to gain information about specific destination hosts.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending ICMP packets, an attacker can probe the system and observe the rate limiting behavior to infer information about the target network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send ICMP packets to the target system. No special privileges are required."
