Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10189

**Vulnerability:** Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Anchor Episodes Index (Spotify for Podcasters) WordPress plugin, versions 2.1.10 and earlier.

**Root Cause:** The plugin's `anchor_episodes` shortcode does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes, specifically `site_url` and `rss_url`, before using them in the output. This allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code via these shortcode attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are saved in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize the `site_url` and `rss_url` attributes passed to the shortcode.
*  **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly escape the shortcode attribute values when rendering the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a WordPress page.
*   This code can be executed when other users visit the affected page.
*   The attacker could potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
*   Impact is broadened because the XSS is stored and doesn't require constant user interaction.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited by inserting a crafted `anchor_episodes` shortcode with malicious JavaScript code in the `site_url` or `rss_url` attributes.
*   This shortcode needs to be placed on a page or post, using the WordPress editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This allows them to create or edit posts/pages, and insert the malicious shortcode.
*  The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious javascript payloads.

**Mitigation:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.11 of the plugin.
*   The fix involves sanitizing and escaping the shortcode attribute values before being included in the output using `esc_url()` and a new validation function that only allows specific domains. `wp_kses_post` is also used on description excerpts.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Wordfence article indicates that the vulnerability was discovered by Peter Thaleikis.
* The fix was implemented in changeset [3171752](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3171752/)
