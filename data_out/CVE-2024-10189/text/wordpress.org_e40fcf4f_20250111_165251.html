## Description

This plugin appends an episode index to the anchor.fm podcast player. Currently, the only available embed for the anchor.fm player is for a single episode.

This plugin allows you to add your entire episode index, just the same as you have on your anchor.fm site.

Simply input your site and RSS URL’s on the settings page and add the shortcode to any page or post.

Email me here for suggestions and feedback.

### Announcements

* Anchor Episodes Index Pro is available now! [Learn more here](https://jesweb.dev)

### Usage

Firstly, install and activate Anchor Episodes Index (this plugin).

Once activated, go to the settings and fill out the Anchor Site URL and Anchor RSS URL fields (be sure to add the URL’s without a “/” at the end, otherwise it will not work).

Then copy the shortcode you’ll see on the settings page and paste it in any page or post.

If you want to add multiple different podcasts on the site, you can define the RSS and Site URL’s as shortcode attributes instead of on the settings page. Note, you cannot currently output two players on one page.

### Shortcode examples

Uses values set in the settings page:

[anchor\_episodes]

Overrides values set on the settings page:

[anchor\_episodes site\_url=”https://anchor.fm/your-podcast” rss\_url=”https://anchor.fm/s/123456-your-key/podcast/rss” max\_episodes=”10″]

I want to give a shoutout to the developer. I emailed him directly and heard back fairly quickly. He updated the plugin and the next day, everything was working the way it was before. The change from Anchor to Spotify Podcast was tough to navigate, I am sure, but Jesse did his best to make sure we could continue using the plugin.
As far as setting the plugin up, it is super simple. You simply need your podcast URL and RSS feed, insert the shortcode, and you are on you way! Nothing complicated at all. Thanks Jesse!

Great work for bringing us this plug-in! I appreciate the work.
One nice feature would be if it’s also possible to only show the latest podcast, without the pulldown feature. So when selecting ” 1″ podcast to display the is no pulldown and only the player with the latests podcast.

This is great — simple and does what it says on the tin. One feature I’d love to see, however, is the ability to limit the number of episodes that are pulled in — rather than the entire list.
It would also be good if there wasn’t additional space at the bottom of the feed but it’s a minor thing compared to how useful this plugin is.

Useful! The only issue we found is when we click on the play icon of an episode, instead of playing it right away, it will just move to the top (main) part of the Anchor player and we’ve to click play again from there. Other than that, everything is working fine.
