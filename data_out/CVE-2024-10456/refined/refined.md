- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data in Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master. The vulnerability exists in the Device-Gateway component, which allows deserialization of arbitrary .NET objects without prior authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502)
    -  Lack of authentication prior to deserialization
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely via network, with low attack complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the vulnerable device.
