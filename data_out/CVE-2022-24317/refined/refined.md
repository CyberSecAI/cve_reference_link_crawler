Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-24317

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication checks within the IGSSDataServer process. This process, which by default listens on TCP port 12401, allows access to functionality without prior authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication before granting access to certain functionalities within the IGSSDataServer.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This lack of authentication allows attackers to gain access to the application's data without any authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the IGSS application. This might include configuration details, operational parameters, or other confidential data.
*   **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** The advisory specifically mentions that the impact is limited to information disclosure. There is no indication of impact on data integrity or system availability (i.e., no unauthorized changes or denial of service).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
*   **Remote:** The attackers can be remote.
*   **TCP Port 12401:** The vulnerability exists in the IGSSDataServer process which listens on TCP port 12401 by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the affected IGSS installation.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any prior authentication.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be carried out without any user interaction.
