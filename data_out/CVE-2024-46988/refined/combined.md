# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Original Submission

Permissions at the artifact level are not correctly verified when an artifact update is submitted with a follow-up comment.

### Impact

Users might receive email notification with information they should not have access to.

CVSSv3.1 score: 4.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

### Exploitation

Given a project with following configuration

* `Bug_Reporters` group with user\_1, user\_2
* `Bug_Managers` group with user\_3

Given a tracker with following tracker permissions

* `all_users`, `registered_users`, `project_members` => no permissions
* `Bug_Managers` => are admin of tracker
* `Bug_Reporters` => can access artifacts they submit

Given `user_2` goes in "my notifications" and check "Notify on all updates"

When `user_1` submit or update an artifact *with a comment*

Then `user_2` receive a full snapshot of the artifact.
