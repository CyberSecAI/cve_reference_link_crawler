Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper neutralization of special elements used in a template engine (Jinja template) within FortiManager provisioning templates. This corresponds to CWE-1336.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Code injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input within Jinja templates. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Execution of unauthorized code or commands on the FortiManager system.
*   Potential for complete system compromise depending on the privileges of the exploited process.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted provisioning templates within FortiManager.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   A local authenticated attacker is required.
*   The attacker needs at least read-only permissions to access and manipulate provisioning templates.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of FortiManager: 7.4 (7.4.0-7.4.1), 7.2 (7.2.0-7.2.4), and 7.0 (7.0.0-7.0.10).
*   The provided CVSSv3 score is 6.8 (Medium), which is calculated with vector `AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:U/RC:C`.
*   The recommended solution is to upgrade to the patched versions: 7.4.2+, 7.2.5+, and 7.0.11+, respectively.
*   A workaround is to disable the "Provisioning Templates" and "Install Policy Package or Device Configuration" privileges when not needed.
