web2py 2.27.1 is the last version of web2py supporting python 2.7

Future versions of web2py will require 3.9 or greater.

While we will continue some limited support for web2py, for future development, we no longer recommend it. We strongly recommend instead web2py's successor: [py4web](https://py4web.com). It is smaller and 10x faster. It uses the same pydal and the same templates as web2py. It includes better Auth, Form, and Grid. Porting web2py apps to py4web is easy. Ask for help on the [py4web google group](https://groups.google.com/g/py4web).

### Web Framework

Free open source full-stack framework for rapid development of fast, scalable, [secure](http://www.web2py.com/book/default/chapter/01#Security) and portable database-driven web-based applications. Written and programmable in [Python](http://www.python.org) (version 3 and 2.7).
