This plugin has worked well but hasn‚Äôt been updated in 3 years and is throwing vulnerability notices from our security plugin currently‚Ä¶ I really like the simple functionality but thinking I might have to ditch it üôÅ

<!‚Äì wp:paragraph ‚Äì>
<p class=‚Äù‚Äù>At the moment this Plugin is not fully working because of a bug in WordPress. I would suggest to not use this one till it‚Äôs fixed. You can‚Äôt use the plugin in the Menu where it, in my opinion, should be placed. However it works in pages and posts, so for a error site it‚Äôs still the best option. Also something is wrong with the WordPress.org editor but that‚Äôs something diffrent.</p>

I think it‚Äôs VERY important to everyone if this would be updated so we know there are no vulnerabilities with the current version of Wordpress. So far you are 4 major revisions behind and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with using this nice plugin. I‚Äôll be looking for an alternative that will be kept up to date.

Seems cools so far! I‚Äôve still got to upgrade I think, but seems pretty easy to use.
