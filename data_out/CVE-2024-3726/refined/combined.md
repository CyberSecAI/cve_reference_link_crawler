### Description

The Login Logout Register Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'llrmloginlogout' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

This plugin has worked well but hasn’t been updated in 3 years and is throwing vulnerability notices from our security plugin currently… I really like the simple functionality but thinking I might have to ditch it 🙁

<!– wp:paragraph –>
<p class=””>At the moment this Plugin is not fully working because of a bug in WordPress. I would suggest to not use this one till it’s fixed. You can’t use the plugin in the Menu where it, in my opinion, should be placed. However it works in pages and posts, so for a error site it’s still the best option. Also something is wrong with the WordPress.org editor but that’s something diffrent.</p>

I think it’s VERY important to everyone if this would be updated so we know there are no vulnerabilities with the current version of Wordpress. So far you are 4 major revisions behind and I don’t feel comfortable with using this nice plugin. I’ll be looking for an alternative that will be kept up to date.

Seems cools so far! I’ve still got to upgrade I think, but seems pretty easy to use.
