Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **lack of administrator control over security** (CWE-671) in the MELSEC-F Series Ethernet interface block. This lack of control allows for sending specially crafted packets that can cause a denial-of-service. The unnecessary opening of TCP ports is also noted as contributing factor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Administrator Control over Security (CWE-671):** The core issue is that the device does not properly restrict or validate the type of network traffic being processed. This leads to a state where arbitrary or specially crafted packets can disrupt the functionality of the device.
*   **Unnecessary Opening of TCP Ports:** The unnecessary opening of TCP ports is also mentioned as a weakness. While not the primary vulnerability, open ports can increase the attack surface by allowing malicious actors to connect and exploit the device if it lacks proper access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition, where the communication function of the affected product is disrupted.
*   **Unspecified Effects:** The vulnerability also mentions the possibility of "other unspecified effects". This suggests that exploitation could potentially lead to further issues beyond just the DoS condition.
*   **System Reset Required for Recovery:** The documentation notes that the system requires a reset for recovery from a DoS condition.
*   **No Impact to PLC:** It is noted that the control of the MELSEC-F series PLC is not affected, indicating that the PLC's operations are likely independent of the Ethernet communication issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, which means an attacker does not require local physical access to the device.
*   **Specially Crafted Packets:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted network packets to the affected device.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the device to send malicious packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device to send the crafted packets.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any prior authentication to exploit, according to the CVSS vector (PR:N)
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The CVSS score indicates a low attack complexity, suggesting the exploitation is not difficult to execute.

**Affected Products:**

*   Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC-F Series with FX3U-ENET, FX3U-ENET-L, and FX3U-ENET-P502 Ethernet interface blocks
*   Specifically, firmware versions 1.14 and prior for these models are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade firmware to version 1.16 or later.
*   Use firewalls or VPNs to prevent unauthorized access when internet access is required.
*   Use the device within a local area network (LAN) and block access from untrusted networks using firewalls.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided documents mention CVE-2021-20613 as a related issue affecting the same product line, but CVE-2021-20612 is the primary focus of the analysis. CVE-2021-20613 is related to Improper Initialization.
*   The vulnerability was reported to CISA by Mitsubishi Electric.
*   There are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
*   The affected devices are used in Critical Manufacturing sectors and are deployed worldwide.
