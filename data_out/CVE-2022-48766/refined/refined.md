The provided content relates to a fix for a potential issue in the AMD display driver, specifically within the DCN301 display engine. The commit messages and code diffs indicate a change to wrap the `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg` function call within `DC_FP_START()` and `DC_FP_END()` macros. This change mirrors similar logic already present for DCN30, suggesting an oversight in DCN301's initial implementation.

Based on the commit message:

*   **Root Cause**: The `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg` function was not wrapped for FPU usage which is required, similar to the existing logic for dcn30.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: Lack of proper FPU wrapping for `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Without the fix, the driver could trigger "lots of WARNs" and potentially cause kernel panics.
*   **Attack vectors**: There is no direct attack vector. The vulnerability is a bug in the code which causes errors in normal operation.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No attacker is required. The issue is triggered during normal operation of the driver.

The fix involves modifying three files:
    *   `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/dcn301/dcn301_resource.c`
        *   Introduces a wrapper function `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg` that wraps the call to the FPU version `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg_fp` within `DC_FP_START()` and `DC_FP_END()` macros.
    *   `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/dml/dcn301/dcn301_fpu.c`
        *   Renames the original `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg` function to `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg_fp`.
    *   `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/dml/dcn301/dcn301_fpu.h`
        *   Updates the function prototype for `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg` to `dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dlg_fp`.

The changes ensure that the calculation function is called within the appropriate FPU context, addressing the root cause and preventing the warnings and kernel panics.
