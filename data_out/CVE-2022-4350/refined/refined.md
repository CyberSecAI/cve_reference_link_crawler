Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of input sanitization for the `content_title` parameter within the `BusinessException` handling when processing search queries in the MCMS application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize the `content_title` parameter when handling exceptions, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page. This code is then reflected back to the user, resulting in an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies and session tokens, leading to account compromise.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive information or modify displayed content.
*   **Redirection:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could use the vulnerable page to display a fake login form.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Search Functionality:** The vulnerability is present in the application's search functionality which uses the `mcms/search.do` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `content_title` parameter when performing a search. The unsanitized input is reflected in the error page, triggering the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter (`content_title`) and the lack of proper sanitization in `BusinessException` handling.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious JavaScript payload.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce a user to perform a search with the malicious payload (typically through a crafted URL).
