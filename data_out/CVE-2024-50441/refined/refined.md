- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Cozy Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing malicious actors to inject client-side scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can allow malicious actors to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. When users visit the compromised page, the injected script executes in the context of the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: This is a cross site scripting vulnerability, meaning the attacker would inject the malicious script into a vulnerable input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a contributor.
