- The document indicates a vulnerability within the core of Oracle VM VirtualBox. The exact nature of the vulnerability is not described but it is related to the VirtualBox core component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The vulnerability lies within the core of Oracle VM VirtualBox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain control of VirtualBox.
- This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the VirtualBox process.
- The vulnerability can also result in a denial of service condition, or other unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation is possible via a local attack vector, meaning the attacker must have some form of access to the system where VirtualBox is running.
- The specific vector is not detailed, but it is likely related to how the core interacts with system resources or handles input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system running vulnerable VirtualBox.
- No other specific capabilities are mentioned.

**Additional Information:**
- The Gentoo advisory indicates the vulnerability is exploitable through local and remote vectors. The Oracle document implies local access is required.
- Patches are available for VirtualBox versions prior to 5.2.36, 6.0.16, and 6.1.2.
- The Oracle advisory identifies an anonymous researcher working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative as the reporter.
- Oracle scores this vulnerability with a CVSS v3.0 base score of 7.5, indicating a high-risk vulnerability when exploited.

The Gentoo security advisories (GLSA 202004-02 and GLSA 202101-09) reference CVE-2020-2698 as one of several vulnerabilities affecting VirtualBox and urge users to upgrade to the latest version. The second advisory lists remote exploitation as possible, which is in contrast with the oracle advisory.
