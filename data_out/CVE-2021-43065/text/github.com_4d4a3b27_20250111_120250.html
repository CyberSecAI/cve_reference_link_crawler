# Fortinet FortiNAC - improper permissions set for tomcat users configuration file (CVE-2021-43065)

Moderate

[orange-cert-cc](/orange-cert-cc)
published
GHSA-8wx4-g5p9-348h
Dec 8, 2021

## Package

FortiNAC
(Fortinet)

## Affected versions

9.1

## Patched versions

9.1.4

## Description

### Overview

An unprivileged user can read the login and the password of the FortiNAC Configuration Wizard stored in cleartext

in a tomcat configuration file and then gaining access to it.

### Impact

This incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource vulnerability may allow an authenticated attacker to access sensitive system data and, as a consequence, raise the authenticated user's privilege to admin.

### Details

An unprivileged ssh user can read the login and the password of the FortiNAC Configuration Wizard (`https://<FortiNAC IP Address>:8443/configWizard`) stored in cleartext in a tomcat configuration file and then gaining access to it.

Once connected, the attacker can change parameters which could lead to a denial of service or change the config password to prevent an administrator to gain back access to this section.

### Proof of Concept

In a CLI SSH session with an unprivileged user, just read the `/bsc/services/tomcat-admin/conf/tomcat-users.xml` file and connect with a browser to the configWizard.

### Solution

#### Security patch

* Upgrade to upcoming FortiNAC version 10.0.0 or above.
* Upgrade to FortiNAC version 9.2.1 or above.
* Upgrade to FortiNAC version 9.1.4 or above.
* Upgrade to FortiNAC version 8.8.10 or above.

#### Workaround

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
