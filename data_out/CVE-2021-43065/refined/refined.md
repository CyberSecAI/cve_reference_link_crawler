Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper file permissions were set for the `tomcat-users.xml` configuration file. This file contained the login and password for the FortiNAC Configuration Wizard in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-732:** Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource. The `tomcat-users.xml` file had overly permissive access, allowing unprivileged users to read its contents.
*   Sensitive information (login and password) stored in cleartext.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could gain access to the FortiNAC Configuration Wizard by reading the credentials from the misconfigured file.
*   The attacker could then change parameters within the Configuration Wizard, potentially leading to:
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Changing the configuration password, preventing administrators from accessing the configuration section.
    *   Privilege escalation. An authenticated user could raise their privileges to admin.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local network, using an SSH session.
*   An attacker needs to be able to log in to the system using an unprivileged ssh user to read the vulnerable file.
*   Access to the `tomcat-users.xml` file, which stores the login and password for the FortiNAC Configuration Wizard.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an unprivileged user account and SSH access to the vulnerable FortiNAC system.
*   No special skills are required besides being able to read a file.
