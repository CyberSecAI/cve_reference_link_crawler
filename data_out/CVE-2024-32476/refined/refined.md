    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of a timeout when executing jqPathExpressions within the `ignoreDifferences` configuration of Argo CD. A malicious user can provide a carefully crafted jq expression that results in an infinite loop or excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to unbounded resource consumption.",
        "Lack of input validation and sanitization for jqPathExpressions.",
        "Missing timeout mechanism for potentially long-running jq operations."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a malicious jqPathExpression in the `ignoreDifferences` configuration. This leads to excessive resource consumption (OOM) and makes the Argo CD instance unresponsive.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted jqPathExpressions in the `ignoreDifferences` configuration of an Argo CD Application or ApplicationSet."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to create or modify Argo CD Applications or ApplicationSets.",
         "Basic understanding of jq syntax to craft an expression that causes an infinite loop or high resource usage."
      ],
       "additional_details": "The provided content includes details from the security advisory GHSA-9m6p-x4h2-6frq and code changes that address CVE-2024-32476. Specifically, the code changes introduce a timeout mechanism to the execution of jq expressions within the Argo CD diffing and ignore normalizer functionalities. This timeout helps in preventing the application from getting stuck in infinite loops and mitigates resource exhaustion. It also makes the timeout configurable via an environment variable, `ARGOCD_IGNORE_NORMALIZER_JQ_TIMEOUT`."
