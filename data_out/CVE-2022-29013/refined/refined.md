    {
      "cve": "CVE-2022-29013",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "The provided content details a command injection vulnerability in the Razer Sila router.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the router's UBUS interface, where the 'file' service's 'exec' method allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands via the 'command' parameter. The router's software fails to sanitize the input in the command parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary command execution with root privileges on the router, potentially leading to full system compromise and control.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to the `/ubus/` endpoint using the 'call' method of the 'file' service with a crafted 'command' parameter."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface to send the malicious POST requests. The attacker needs to know the interface used to execute commands (ubus) and the correct json request structure. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
