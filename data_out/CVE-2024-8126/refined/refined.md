Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-8126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient file type validation and upload restrictions in the `class_fma_connector.php` file of the Advanced File Manager WordPress plugin. This allows authenticated users to upload files with dangerous types, such as `.htaccess`, which can lead to further exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin fails to properly restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:**  The plugin, prior to version 5.2.9, allowed subscriber-level users to potentially upload files with dangerous extensions given the right configuration.
*   **Inadequate File Name Sanitization:** Although the plugin attempts to sanitize filenames, it was not sufficient to prevent the upload of files with malicious extensions.
*  **Missing Upload Deny:**  The `uploadDeny` configuration was set to `array('all')` which, although intended to deny all uploads, it is overridden by other parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload files of their choosing, including those that can execute code on the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious `.htaccess` file, an attacker can reconfigure the server to allow execution of code contained in other uploaded files, leading to RCE.
*   **Full Site Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the affected WordPress website, allowing attackers to modify content, steal sensitive information, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP(S).
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Plugin Configuration:** The plugin's settings, particularly the access permissions and upload restrictions, play a role in the exploitability of the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a registered user on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to access the file manager functionality of the plugin, which requires the necessary access permissions set by an administrator.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.2.9 of the Advanced File Manager plugin. The fix includes:
    *   Implementing proper restrictions on file upload types for non-admin users.
    *   Sanitizing file names to prevent the upload of files with extensions that could lead to RCE (e.g. php, phtml, ini, htaccess, config, css, js)
    *   Adding a specific function to validate file names (`afm_plugin_file_validName`).
    *   Adjusting the `uploadDeny` and `uploadOrder` parameters based on the user's permissions.
*   The plugin uses elFinder library, which is configured via `class_fma_connector.php`.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type" and has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High).
