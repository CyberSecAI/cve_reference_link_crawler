Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of special characters within usernames during the login process. Specifically, the use of characters like half parentheses or square brackets in usernames can cause the session management program to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The session management program does not properly sanitize or validate user inputs, leading to a crash when special characters are used in the username field. This suggests a lack of robust input handling, allowing unexpected characters to interfere with program operation.
- **Denial of Service:** This is the core vulnerability. By crashing the session management program, the attacker prevents legitimate users from logging into their devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is that users are unable to log into and use their GL.iNet devices. This renders the affected devices effectively unusable until the session management program is restarted or the device is rebooted.
- **Business Disruption:** This vulnerability could severely impact GL.iNet's customers, especially if their devices are integral for their business.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Exposure:** The attack requires the target device to be exposed to the external network through DDNS, allowing the attacker to find its open IP addresses and ports.
- **Malicious Login Attempts:** The attacker then invokes the login interface and attempts to log in using special crafted usernames containing the vulnerable characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the login interface of the GL.iNet device, typically through the internet by obtaining the device's IP address.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific special characters (such as half parentheses or square brackets) that trigger the crash.
- **Automated Scanning:** Based on the provided details, the attacker would likely use a network scanning tool to detect publicly exposed devices running vulnerable firmware.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects a wide range of GL.iNet devices and firmware versions.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a simple crafted login attempt and doesn't require any sophisticated exploitation techniques.
- Patches are available for each device and affected firmware version.
