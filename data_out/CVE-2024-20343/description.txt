A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read any file in the file system of the underlying Linux operating system. The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device.

This vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the arguments that are passed to a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with low-privileged credentials and using the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker access files in read-only mode on the Linux file system.
