- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect validation of arguments passed to a specific CLI command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, allowing an attacker to bypass intended restrictions on file access. Specifically, the vulnerability allows an authenticated local user to read arbitrary files on the underlying Linux OS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain read-only access to any file on the Linux filesystem. This can lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access via the CLI interface on Cisco IOS XR devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid low-privileged credentials to log in to the affected device.
