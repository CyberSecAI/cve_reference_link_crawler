The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device.  This vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the arguments that are passed to a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with low-privileged credentials and using the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker access files in read-only mode on the Linux file system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
