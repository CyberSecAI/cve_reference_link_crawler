Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how XWiki handles the "title" parameter during page creation. When a user is tricked into accessing a specially crafted URL for creating a new page, the provided title (which can contain malicious script code) is not displayed in the initial create action dialog. Instead, the title is only displayed in the edit action that occurs after the initial creation, but by that time, the malicious script has already been executed. This allows for a bypass of the user's ability to review or correct the title before execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unescaped Input:** The "title" parameter is not properly sanitized or escaped when used in the create action, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
*   **Delayed Display:** The title is not displayed to the user during the initial creation step, but only in the subsequent edit step after the code has already been executed.
*  **Lack of Preview:** There is no preview of the title during the initial page creation step.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the victim's session.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the victim has programming rights in XWiki, this vulnerability can be escalated to full remote code execution, potentially granting the attacker full access to the XWiki instance.
*   **Redirection:** The attacker can use the executed script to redirect the victim to another URL, further concealing the attack.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker can use social engineering to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or a fake create button.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attack can be performed by any authenticated user, if the victim has additional rights, the attacker gains those rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** Attackers can craft a malicious URL with a script in the title parameter.
    Example:  `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/create/NonExistingSpace/WebHome?title=$services.logging.getLogger(%22foo%22).error(%22Script%20executed!%22)`
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers trick victims into visiting the malicious URL through social engineering tactics.
*   **Fake Buttons:** Attackers could place a fake "create page" button on a page that links to the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of XWiki:** Attackers need to understand how XWiki's page creation process works.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** Attackers must be able to construct URLs with the malicious title parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click on a malicious link or interact with a fake button.
*   **XWiki Edit Rights (for the fake button vector):** To place the fake create button, the attacker requires edit rights.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in XWiki versions 7.2-milestone-2 and 7.2-milestone-3 due to changes in how the create UI handled inputs and the introduction of the "title" parameter.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in XWiki versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1. The fix involves displaying the title in the first step of the create action so that the user can review and correct it before it's executed.
*   A patch is available which modifies the templates to display the title. The patch modifies the following files:
    * `xwiki-platform-flamingo/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin-resources/src/main/resources/flamingo/create.vm`
    * `xwiki-platform-web-templates/src/main/resources/templates/createinline.vm`
    *  `xwiki-platform-web-templates/src/main/resources/templates/locationPicker_macros.vm`
   *  `xwiki-platform-web-war/src/main/webapp/resources/uicomponents/widgets/locationPicker.js`
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 9.1, categorized as critical.
