# Tina search token leak via lock file in TinaCMS

High

[wicksipedia](/wicksipedia)
published
GHSA-4qrm-9h4r-v2fx
Sep 3, 2024

## Package

npm

@tinacms/cli
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.6.2

## Patched versions

1.6.2

## Description

### Impact

Tina search token leaked via lock file (tina-lock.json) in TinaCMS. Sites building with @tinacms/cli < 1.6.2 that use a search token are impacted.

If your Tina-enabled website has search setup, you should rotate that key immediately.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli@1.6.2

### Workarounds

Upgrading, and rotating search token is required for the proper fix.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
