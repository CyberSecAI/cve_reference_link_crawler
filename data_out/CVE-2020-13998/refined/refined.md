    "vulnerability_impact": "Information Disclosure",
    "attack_vector": "To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can use brute force methods to determine whether or not a list of users exists on the affected server by monitoring the HTTP responses returned by the server; the HTTP responses differ substantially between valid and invalid users.",
    "description": "Citrix XenApp 6.5, when 2FA is enabled, allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to ascertain whether a user exists on the server, because the 2FA error page only occurs after a valid username is entered.",
    "additional_information": "Two-factor authentication must be enabled in Citrix XenApp 6.5 for this vulnerability to be exploited. When a valid user is entered into the login page (with an invalid password), the server returns a two-factor authentication error page. When a nonexistent user is entered, the page does not change. Users on the server can be enumerated with complete confidence by monitoring which users trigger the two-factor authentication error page, and which do not."
