|  | Vulnerability Name: User Enumeration in Citrix XenApp 6.5 |
| --- | --- |
|  | Registered: CVE-2020-13998 |
|  |  |
|  | Discoverers: |
|  | Scott Goodwin, OSCP |
|  | Jill Kamperides |
|  | OCD Tech |
|  | https://ocd-tech.com |
|  |  |
|  | Vendor of Product: |
|  | Citrix |
|  |  |
|  | Affected Product Code Base: |
|  | XenApp - Version 6.5 |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Type: |
|  | Remote |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerability Type: |
|  | User Enumeration |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerability Impact: |
|  | Information Disclosure |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Vector: |
|  | To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can use brute force methods |
|  | to determine whether or not a list of users exists on the affected |
|  | server by monitoring the HTTP responses returned by the server; the |
|  | HTTP responses differ substantially between valid and invalid users. |
|  |  |
|  | Description: |
|  | \*\* VERSION NOT SUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\* Citrix XenApp 6.5, when 2FA |
|  | is enabled, allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to ascertain |
|  | whether a user exists on the server, because the 2FA error page only |
|  | occurs after a valid username is entered. |
|  |  |
|  | Additional Information: |
|  | Two-factor authentication must be enabled in Citrix XenApp 6.5 for |
|  | this vulnerability to be exploited. When a valid user is entered into |
|  | the login page (with an invalid password), the server returns a |
|  | two-factor authentication error page. When a nonexistent user is entered, |
|  | the page does not change. Users on the server can be enumerated with |
|  | complete confidence by monitoring which users trigger the two-factor |
|  | authentication error page, and which do not. |
|  |  |
|  | This vulnerability was disclosed to Citrix on 04/30/2020. Citrix |
|  | responded that XenApp version 6.5 has reached its End of Life (EOL) |
|  | and will not be receiving a patch. Users are recommended to upgrade |
|  | to resolve this vulnerability. |
|  |  |
|  | Reporting Timeline: |
|  | 04/30/2020: Vulnerability was reported to Citrix |
|  | 05/22/2020: Citrix deems XenApp 6.5 End of Life |
|  | 06/09/2020: Vulnerability registered |
|  | 06/10/2020: Public disclosure |
