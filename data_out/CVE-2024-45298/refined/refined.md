Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the password reset functionality not properly checking if an account is disabled before allowing a password reset to occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of Account Disabling:** The core issue is that a disabled user can still initiate and successfully complete the password reset process.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The password reset process lacks proper validation to prevent disabled accounts from using this mechanism for gaining access.
- **Logic Error:** The password reset logic did not consider the 'isActive' status of the account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A disabled user can regain access to the system by resetting their password, effectively bypassing the disable account feature.
- **Privilege Escalation:** After gaining unauthorized access, the user can perform all actions they were previously authorized to do before being disabled.
- **Security Breach:** This allows a disabled user to potentially perform malicious activities, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Password Reset Functionality:** The vulnerability is triggered through the password reset mechanism.
- **Email:** The user must have access to the email associated with the disabled account to receive the reset link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Disabled Account:** The attacker must have a user account that has been disabled by an administrator.
- **Email Access:** The attacker needs access to the email account associated with the disabled user account to receive and act on the password reset email.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Wiki application

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version `2.5.303` of the Wiki.js software and is fixed in version `2.5.304`
- The provided commit diff shows that the fix prevents password resets on disabled accounts, by adding a check to ensure `usr.isActive` is true before proceeding with the reset.
