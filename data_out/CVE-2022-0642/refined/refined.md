- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly check CSRF tokens on POST requests to the plugins admin page, and does not sanitize some parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into injecting arbitrary JavaScript, potentially leading to account takeover or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious form that targets the vulnerable admin page and tricks an administrator into submitting it, bypassing CSRF protection. The injected javascript is stored in the plugin's settings. When an administrator clicks "Go to Web Application" within the plugin, the stored javascript is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to submit a crafted form. No special privileges are needed beyond that.
