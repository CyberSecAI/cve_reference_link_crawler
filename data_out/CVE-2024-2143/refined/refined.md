Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2143

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Ultimate Addons for Beaver Builder – Lite" WordPress plugin, specifically affecting the Heading widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the Heading widget before rendering it on the page. This allows the injection of arbitrary web scripts.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't adequately sanitize user input when creating the heading.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly escape the output before rendering it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a page. When other users access this page, the injected script executes in their browsers.
- **Account Takeover/Data Theft:** The injected scripts can be used to redirect users to phishing sites, steal cookies and session tokens, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to account takeovers and/or data theft.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker can potentially alter the content displayed on the vulnerable page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the "Ultimate Addons for Beaver Builder – Lite" plugin.
- **Heading Widget:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered through the plugin's Heading widget.
- **Malicious Input:** The attack is carried out by injecting malicious scripts within the heading's input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account with at least contributor-level access.
- **Access to Edit Pages:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit pages where the vulnerable Heading widget can be placed/edited.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.5.7.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5.8 by adding input sanitization and output escaping.
