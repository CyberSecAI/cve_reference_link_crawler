Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the "Mobile Plugin for Jira," a component bundled with Jira Server, Jira Data Center, and Jira Service Management. Specifically, a batch endpoint in this plugin is susceptible to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Read SSRF:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.  The attacker can fully read the response of the server.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The "method" parameter within the body of the vulnerable endpoint is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing control over the HTTP method and the target URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to potentially access sensitive information on the internal network, including files, services and AWS credentials if the Jira instance is deployed on AWS.
- **Full read SSRF:** The attacker can read the full response of the forged request.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack occurs over the network via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Batch endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is a batch endpoint in the Mobile Plugin for Jira.
- **HTTP Method Control:** The attacker can control the HTTP method and location of the target URL via the `method` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user, including users who joined through the sign-up feature.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Jira instance.
