### **CVE-2022-26135 Full Read SSRF in Jira Server**

### **Description**

A full-read server-side request forgery exists in [Mobile Plugin for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220151/mobile-plugin-for-jira-data-center-and-server?tab=overview&hosting=datacenter), which is bundled with Jira and Jira Service Management. It is exploitable by any authenticated user (including a user who joined via the sign-up feature). It specifically affects the batch HTTP endpoint used in Mobile Plugin for Jira. It is possible to control the HTTP method and location of the intended URL through the method parameter in the body of the vulnerable endpoint.

All versions of Jira and Jira Service Management prior to the fixed version listed above are affected by this vulnerability. These issues can be tracked here:

* [JRASERVER-73863](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-73863)

  STATUS
* [JSDSERVER-11840](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-11840)
  -
  Getting issue details...
  STATUS

This does not affect the other System app named `Jira Mobile`.

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **high**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels "https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels"). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, medium, or low.

Depending on the environment the Jira instance is deployed in, the impact of this bug varies. For example, when deployed in AWS, it could leak sensitive credentials.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge Shubham Shah and Dylan Pindur of [Assetnote](https://assetnote.io/ "https://assetnote.io/") for finding this vulnerability.

  + 4.22.4
  + 5.0.0

You can download the latest versions from the download pages for [Jira Core](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/core/download "https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/core/download"), [Jira Software](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/update "https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/update"), or [Jira Service Management](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/update "https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/update").

Please note, these are the first versions that include the fix for CVE-2022-26135. More current bug fix releases are available for the releases listed above. Atlassian recommends upgrading to the most current bug fix version.

#### **Mitigation**

Installing a fixed version of Jira or Jira Service Management is the surest way to remediate CVE-2022-26135. If you are unable to immediately upgrade Jira or Jira Service Management, then as a temporary workaround, you can manually upgrade [Mobile Plugin for Jira Data Center and Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220151/mobile-plugin-for-jira-data-center-and-server?tab=overview&hosting=datacenter) (`com.atlassian.jira.mobile.jira-mobile-rest`) to the version specified in this section (or [disable the plugin](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/disabling-and-enabling-apps-273875716.html "https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/disabling-and-enabling-apps-273875716.html")).

The following version of the Mobile Plugin for Jira app contains a fix for this issue:

* 3.2.15 (compatible with Jira 8.3.x - 8.22.4 and JSM 4.3.x - 4.22.4)

### How to upgrade the app

**Scenario A**: User-installed apps

If you find the “Mobile Plugin for Jira” app located in the User-installed apps section, you can just click **Update** to get the latest version.

**Scenario B:** System apps

If you find the “Mobile Plugin for Jira” app located in the System apps section, follow these instructions to manually update the app (*no restart required!)*:

1. Download a fixed version of the app (you’ll save this as a `JAR` file) from the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220151/mobile-plugin-for-jira-data-center-and-server?hosting=datacenter&tab=versions) that is compatible with your Jira version
2. During a maintenance window:
   1. Navigate to Admin > Manage Apps
   2. Select **Upload app**
   3. Select the `JAR` file you downloaded in Step 1

After the install, the new version will be displayed as a user-installed app instead of a system app.

![](https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/atlassian/info_64.png) The previous `JAR` file can remain in the directory `<Jira Install>/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/atlassian-bundled-plugins` without further action.
