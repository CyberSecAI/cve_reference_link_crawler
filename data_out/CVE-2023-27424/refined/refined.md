- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Inactive User Deleter WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a forged request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, would execute actions within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to trigger a crafted request. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
