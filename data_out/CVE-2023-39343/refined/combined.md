# Observable Response Discrepancy on Admin Login

Moderate

[alexander-schranz](/alexander-schranz)
published
GHSA-wmwf-49vv-p3mr
Aug 3, 2023

## Package

composer

sulu/sulu
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>=2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.5.10

## Description

### Impact

It allows over the Admin Login form to detect which user (username, email) exists and which one do not exist.

Impacted by this issue are Sulu installation >= 2.5.0 and <2.5.10 using the newer Symfony Security System which is default since Symfony 6.0 but can be enabled in Symfony 5.4. Sulu Installation not using the old Symfony 5.4 security System and previous version are not impacted by this Security issue.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in version 2.5.10.

### Workarounds

Create a custom AuthenticationFailureHandler which does not return the `$exception->getMessage();` instead the `$exception->getMessageKey();`

### References

Currently no references.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-39343

### Weaknesses

[CWE-204](/advisories?query=cwe%3A204)

### Credits
