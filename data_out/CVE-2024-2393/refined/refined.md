Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `add_user.php` file. User-supplied data from the `city` POST parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any prior cleaning or escaping, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically a time-based blind SQL injection. The vulnerability exists because user-supplied data is directly used within the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the database by injecting malicious SQL code. In this case, the example payload uses `SLEEP(10)` to cause a time delay, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary SQL statements.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Through blind SQL injection techniques, an attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by making conditional queries and observing response times or other differences.
- **Potential Full Compromise:** Depending on database configuration and permissions, successful SQL injection attacks can lead to more severe consequences, such as data deletion, modification, or even full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request sent to the `add_user.php` endpoint.
- **'city' Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `city` parameter within the POST data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to possess knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques to formulate effective payloads.
- **No Authentication Required**: The content states that no login is required to trigger the SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable File:** `add_user.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `city` (POST parameter)
- **Payload Example:** `username=1&email=2&mobile=3&city=4' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))a) AND '1'='1`

This payload demonstrates the time-based blind SQL injection. The `SLEEP(10)` command forces the database to pause execution for 10 seconds, verifying the vulnerability.
