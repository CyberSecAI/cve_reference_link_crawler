The provided content is a security advisory from Yubico regarding CVE-2024-31498.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The YubiKey Manager GUI, when run as Administrator on Windows, spawns the system's default browser as a child process. Due to Windows requiring administrative privileges to interact with FIDO authenticators, YubiKey Manager GUI may inherit these privileges, resulting in the spawned browser window also running with administrative permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Privilege Escalation: Browser windows launched by the YubiKey Manager GUI could inherit administrator privileges.
- Unintended elevated browser execution: The GUI may unintentionally execute a browser with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker could exploit the elevated privileges of the spawned browser window to perform actions as an Administrator. This includes the potential for increased impact from browser-based attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
A local attacker can leverage the vulnerability by manipulating or using the elevated browser window for malicious purposes. The attack requires user interaction with the YubiKey Manager GUI to trigger the browser launch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system where the vulnerable YubiKey Manager GUI is running.
- User must run the YubiKey Manager GUI with administrative privileges on a Windows system.
- The system must be using a browser other than Microsoft Edge as the default browser to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the spawned browser process.
