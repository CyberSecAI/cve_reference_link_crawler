- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SIPROTEC 5 devices are using weak encryption ciphers on ports 443/tcp (web), 4443/tcp (DIGSI 5), and a configurable port for syslog over TLS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Usage of inadequate encryption strength (CWE-326). Specifically, the use of weak ciphers on the aforementioned ports.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position can decrypt data transmitted over the vulnerable ports, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept traffic between a legitimate client and the affected SIPROTEC 5 device.

The advisory provides specific vulnerable product versions and remediation steps (updates) for the affected devices.
