The content is related to CVE-2024-42485.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the export download route `/filament-excel/{path}`. The application allowed downloading arbitrary files if the web server permits `../` in the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The application did not properly sanitize the `path` parameter in the URL, allowing attackers to traverse the file system and access files outside of the intended directory.
- Lack of Authentication: The download route did not require any login or authentication, making it accessible to any user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized File Access: An attacker could download any file accessible to the web server, potentially exposing sensitive data, source code, or configuration files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is accessible over the network via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/filament-excel/{path}` endpoint, with a malicious path parameter containing directory traversal sequences like `../`.
- The attacker does not need any authentication or user interaction.
