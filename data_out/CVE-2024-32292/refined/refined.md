Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a command injection vulnerability within the `formexeCommand` function of the Tenda W30Ev1.0 router firmware. Specifically, the `cmdinput` parameter, which is provided by the user, is passed into the `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a classic command injection. The `cmdinput` parameter is directly used to construct a system command which allows injection of arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system. This could lead to a variety of impacts such as, but not limited to:
    *   Full control over the router.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Further attacks on the network the router is connected to.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the router. Specifically, by sending a POST request to the `/goform/exeCommand` endpoint with a malicious `cmdinput` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This likely means the attacker must be on the same network as the router or have access through a vulnerable port exposed to the internet.
