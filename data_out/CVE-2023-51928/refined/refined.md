```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `insertIcon` method in the `nc.itf.uap.sf.ICustomMenuService` interface allows saving data from the `icon` attribute of the `customMenuIcon` parameter to a path specified in the `cIconID` property without proper access control.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient access control.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious activities.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through the `doPost` method of the `nc.bs.framework.comn.serv.CommonServletDispatcher` class, which can execute public methods of specific class objects. An attacker can exploit the `insertIcon` method by crafting a malicious request targeting the vulnerable `nc.itf.uap.sf.ICustomMenuService` interface and supplying a malicious file in the `icon` attribute along with a destination path in the `cIconID` property.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the vulnerable interface and method.
