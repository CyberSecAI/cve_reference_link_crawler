# RCE in TranformGraph().to\_dot\_graph function

High

[eteq](/eteq)
published
GHSA-h2x6-5jx5-46hf
Mar 18, 2024

## Package

pip

astropy
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

5.3.2

## Patched versions

5.3.3

## Description

### Summary

RCE due to improper input validation in TranformGraph().to\_dot\_graph function

### Details

Due to improper input validation a malicious user can provide a command or a script file as a value to `savelayout` argument, which will be placed as the first value in a list of arguments passed to `subprocess.Popen`.

[astropy/astropy/coordinates/transformations.py](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/9b97d98802ee4f5350a62b681c35d8687ee81d91/astropy/coordinates/transformations.py#L539)

|  | args = [savelayout] |
| --- | --- |

Although an error will be raised, the command or script will be executed successfully.

$ cat /tmp/script

echo astrorce > /tmp/poc.txt

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
