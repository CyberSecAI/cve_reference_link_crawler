This vulnerability is due to insufficient memory protection in the Cisco IOS XE Meraki migration feature of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying the Meraki registration parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to *root*.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory. To use the form, follow these steps:    1.
