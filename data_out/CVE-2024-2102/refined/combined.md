## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Salon booking system < 9.6.3 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the 'Mobile Phone' field and 'sms\_prefix' parameter when booking an appointment, allowing customers to conduct Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. The payload gets triggered when an admin visits the 'Bookings' page and the malicious script is executed in the admin context.

### Proof of Concept

While booking an appointment, paste the following script in the "Mobile phone" field:
" onmouseover=alert(1234);//
Next, as an administrator view https://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=sln\_booking, and hover your the Tel. part of that new entry's username column.
This can also be exploited by sending the sln[sms\_prefix] parameter, which you may have to create in the form like so:
While booking an appointment. Fill most fields with valid user information, then use your browser's inspector to rename the "Address" input field's name from sln[address] to sln[sms\_prefix], and set its value to "onmousemove=alert(123);//.
