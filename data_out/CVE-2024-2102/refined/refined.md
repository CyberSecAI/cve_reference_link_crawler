- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-provided input in the 'Mobile Phone' field and 'sms_prefix' parameter when booking an appointment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the context of an administrator's browser when they view the 'Bookings' page. This could lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities performed with admin privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload in the 'Mobile Phone' field or 'sms_prefix' parameter during the booking process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make a booking through the salon booking system, which is typically an unauthenticated action available to users of the site.
