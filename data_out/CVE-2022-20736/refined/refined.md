- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization checking for HTTP requests submitted to the web-based management interface of Cisco AppDynamics Controller Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authorization bypass vulnerability (CWE-939) due to inadequate checks on HTTP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to a configuration file and the login page for an administrative console. This could potentially lead to further unauthorized access to sensitive information or system manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected instance of AppDynamics Controller via its web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected AppDynamics Controller instance remotely, and does not require any authentication.
