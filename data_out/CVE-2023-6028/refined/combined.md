Purpose

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R has a rigorous internal cyber security continuous improvement process which involves regular testing
with industry leading tools and periodic assessments to identify potential product issues. Occasionally
an issue is determined to be a design or coding flaw with implications that may impact product cyber
security.

When a potential product vulnerability is identified or reported, B&R immediately initiates our vulnerability
handling  process. This  entails  validating  if  the  issue  is  in  fact  a  product  issue,  identifying  root  causes,
determining what related products may be impacted, developing a remediation, and notifying end users
and governmental organizations.

The resulting Cyber Security Advisory intends to notify customers of the vulnerability and provide details
on which products are impacted, how to mitigate the vulnerability or explain workarounds that minimize
the potential risk as much as possible. The release of a  Cyber Security Advisory should not be miscon-
strued as an affirmation or indication of  an active threat or ongoing campaign  targeting the products
mentioned here. If B&R is aware of any specific threats, it will be clearly mentioned in the communication.

The publication of this Cyber Security Advisory is an example of B&R’s commitment to the user community
in support of this critical topic. Responsible disclosure is an important element in the chain of trust we
work to maintain with our many customers. The release of an Advisory provides timely information which
is essential to help ensure our customers are fully informed.

Affected products

B&R Automation Runtime < I4.93

Vulnerability IDs

CVE-2023-6028

Summary

An update is available that resolves a vulnerability in the product versions listed above.

A unathenticated network attacker could use the vulnerability to construct a hyperlink that, if issued by
another user, could execute malicious script code within the user's browser in the context of the user's
session.

Recommended immediate actions

The problem is corrected in the following product versions: B&R Automation Runtime version >= I4.93

B&R recommends that customers apply the update at earliest convenience.

The process to install updates is described in the user manual. The step to identify the installed product
version is described in the user manual.

Vulnerability severity and details

A vulnerability exists in the System Diagnostics Manager included in the product versions listed above. An
unauthenticated network attacker could exploit the vulnerability by  creating a hyperlink including mali-
cious script code, which could lead to remote code execution in the context of the attacked user’s browser
session. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could modify or steal information avail-
able in the context of the attacked user’s browser session.

The severity assessment has been performed by using the FIRST Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) v3.11.

CVE-2023-6028

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the SVG version of System Diagnostics Man-
ager of B&R Automation Runtime versions < I4.93 that enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary Ja-
vaScript code in the context of the attacked user’s browser session.

Mitigating factors

Deactivate the System Diagnostics Manager when not needed.

Refer to section “General security recommendations” for further advise on how to keep your system se-
cure.

Workarounds
Do not use Hyperlinks provided by untrusted 3rd party to access the SDM. Hyperlinks may be provided via:

•  Emails from unknown users

•  Social media channels

•  Messaging services

•  Webpages with comment functionality

•  QR Codes

The use of external Web Application Firewalls (WAF) can mitigate attacks using reflected cross-site script-
ing.

1 The CVSS Environmental Score, which can affect the vulnerability severity, is not provided in this advisory since it reflects
the potential impact of a vulnerability within the end-user organizations’ computing environment; end-user organizations
are therefore recommended to analyze their situation and specify the Environmental Score.

Frequently asked questions

What is the scope of the vulnerability?

An  unauthenticated  network  attacker  who  successfully  exploited  this vulnerability  could  insert  and  run
arbitrary Script code in the context of the attacked user’s browser session.

What causes the vulnerability?

The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation in the SVG version of the System Diagnostics Man-
ager of B&R Automation Runtime.

What is System Diagnostics Manager (SDM)?

System  Diagnostics  Manager  (SDM)  is  a  webpage  available  over  the  Automation  Runtime  Webserver,
showing key diagnostic information of the running controller.

What is B&R Automation Runtime (AR)?

B&R Automation Runtime (AR) is a real-time operating system running on all B&R target systems.

What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could modify or steal information available in the
context of the attacked user’s browser session.

How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a  hyperlink including malicious script code.
This hyperlink must be opened by the user to launch the attack.

Could the vulnerability be exploited remotely?

Yes, an attacker does not need physical access to the system running B&R Automation Runtime or to the
user's computer.

What does the update do?

The  update  removes  the  vulnerability  by  modifying  the  way  that  the  System  Diagnostics  Manager  vali-
dates input and answers after receiving invalid messages.

When this security advisory was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?

No, B&R discovered this vulnerability as a part of its own security analyses.

When  this  security  advisory  was  issued,  had  B&R  received  any  reports  that  this
vulnerability was being exploited?

No, B&R had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been exploited when this
security advisory was originally issued.

General security recommendations

For any installation of software-related B&R products we strongly recommend the following (non-exhaus-
tive) list of cyber security practices:

–

–

Isolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls
and separate them from any general purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).

Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, peripheral
equipment, and networks.

–  Never connect programming software or computers containing programing software to any net-work

other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.

–  Scan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.

–  Minimize network exposure for all applications and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible
from the Internet unless they are designed for such exposure and the intended use requires such.

–  Ensure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system and firmware

patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.

–  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recog-
nize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.
Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
