Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet's handling of command execution. Specifically, the servlet attempts to escape command strings by wrapping them in quotation marks. However, this escaping mechanism is flawed, as it does not properly handle input containing quotation marks followed by a space. This leads to the command being split into multiple tokens, resulting in the execution of the wrong command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Handling:** The CGI servlet incorrectly handles filenames with spaces and quotation marks.
- **Insufficient Command Escaping:** The escaping algorithm is flawed and leads to command injection.
- **Reliance on Runtime.exec:** The vulnerability is made exploitable by calling Runtime.exec to execute the command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect Command Execution:** An attacker can manipulate the filename provided to the CGI servlet to execute an unintended command.
- **Bypass Alias Checks:** The vulnerability can bypass alias checks, which are intended to prevent command injection.
- **Unintended Behavior:** A command prefix can be combined with a crafted binary name which could cause unintended behaviours.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network based, as it involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable CGI servlet.
- **Malicious Filename:** The attacker needs to provide a binary file name that contains a quotation mark followed by a space in the request to the CGI servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of CGI Servlet Behavior:** The attacker must understand how the CGI servlet handles command escaping.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not need high privileges to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific combination of characters (a quotation mark followed by a space) within the requested binary name.
- The vulnerability is further exacerbated if the `useFullPath` configuration setting is off.
- The `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` servlet has been deprecated in Jetty 9.x, 10.x, and 11.x and completely removed in Jetty 12.
- The recommended workaround is to avoid using the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` servlet and use FastCGI support instead.
