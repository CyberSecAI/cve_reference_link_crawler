## Description

If a user sends a request to a `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet for a binary with a space in its name, the servlet

will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation marks. This wrapped command, plus

an optional command prefix, will then be executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the

original binary name provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space,

the resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one. For example, if a

request references a binary called file” name “here, the escaping algorithm will

generate the command line string “file” name “here”, which will invoke the binary

named file, not the one that the user requested.

```
if (execCmd.length() > 0 && execCmd.charAt(0) != '"' && execCmd.contains(" "))
execCmd = "\"" + execCmd + "\"";
```
### Exploit Scenario

The cgi-bin directory contains a binary named exec and a subdirectory named exec”

commands, which contains a file called bin1. The user sends to the CGI servlet a request

for the filename exec” commands/bin1. This request will pass the file existence check on

lines 194 through 205. The servlet will add quotation marks around this filename, resulting

in the command line string “exec” commands/bin1”. When this string is passed to

Runtime.exec, instead of executing the bin1 binary, the server will execute the exec

binary with the argument commands/file1”. In addition to being incorrect, this behavior

may bypass alias checks, and it may cause other unintended behaviors if a command prefix

is configured.

If the useFullPath configuration setting is off, the command need not pass the existence

check. The attack would not rely on a binary and subdirectory having similar names, and

the attack will succeed on a much wider variety of directory structures.

### Impact

Users of the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet with a very specific command structure may have the wrong command executed.

### Patches

No patch.

In Jetty 9.x, 10.x, and 11.x the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` has been deprecated.

In Jetty 12 (all environments) the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` has been entirely removed.

### Workarounds

The `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet should not be used. Fast CGI support is available instead.

Package        : jetty9
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-26048 CVE-2023-26049 CVE-2023-36479 CVE-2023-40167
                 CVE-2023-41900

Multiple security vulnerabilities were found in Jetty, a Java based web server
and servlet engine.

The org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI class has been deprecated. It is potentially
unsafe to use it. The upstream developers of Jetty recommend to use Fast CGI
instead. See also CVE-2023-36479.

CVE-2023-26048

    In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with
    `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or
    `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the
    client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no
    filename and very large content. This happens even with the default
    settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part
    content to disk.

CVE-2023-26049

    Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle
    cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by
    tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.

CVE-2023-40167

    Prior to this version Jetty accepted the `+` character proceeding the
    content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is more permissive than
    allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with
    400 responses. There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable
    that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a
    server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400
    response.

CVE-2023-36479

    Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command structure may have the
    wrong command executed. If a user sends a request to a
    org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary with a space in its
    name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation
    marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be
    executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name
    provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the
    resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one.

CVE-2023-41900

    Jetty is vulnerable to weak authentication. If a Jetty
    `OpenIdAuthenticator` uses the optional nested `LoginService`, and that
    `LoginService` decides to revoke an already authenticated user, then the
    current request will still treat the user as authenticated. The
    authentication is then cleared from the session and subsequent requests
    will not be treated as authenticated. So a request on a previously
    authenticated session could be allowed to bypass authentication after it
    had been rejected by the `LoginService`. This impacts usages of the
    jetty-openid which have configured a nested `LoginService` and where that
    `LoginService` is capable of rejecting previously authenticated users.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.4.39-3+deb11u2.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.50-4+deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>

We have FastCGI servlet that is better maintained.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I think you missed a reference to `CGI` in `jetty-ee10-demo-jetty-webapp`'s `web.xml`.

Same for ee9.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Package        : jetty9
Version        : 9.4.16-0+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-26048 CVE-2023-26049 CVE-2023-36479 CVE-2023-40167

Multiple security vulnerabilities were found in Jetty, a Java based web server
and servlet engine.

The org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI class has been deprecated. It is potentially
unsafe to use it. The upstream developers of Jetty recommend to use Fast CGI
instead. See also CVE-2023-36479.

CVE-2023-26048

    In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with
    `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or
    `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the
    client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no
    filename and very large content. This happens even with the default
    settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part
    content to disk.

CVE-2023-26049

    Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle
    cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by
    tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.

CVE-2023-40167

    Prior to this version Jetty accepted the `+` character proceeding the
    content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is more permissive than
    allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with
    400 responses. There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable
    that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a
    server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400
    response.

CVE-2023-36479

    Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command structure may have the
    wrong command executed. If a user sends a request to a
    org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary with a space in its
    name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation
    marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be
    executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name
    provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the
    resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
9.4.16-0+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

For the detailed security status of jetty9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
