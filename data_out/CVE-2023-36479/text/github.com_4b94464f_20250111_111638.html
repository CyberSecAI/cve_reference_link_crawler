## Description

If a user sends a request to a `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet for a binary with a space in its name, the servlet

will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation marks. This wrapped command, plus

an optional command prefix, will then be executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the

original binary name provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space,

the resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one. For example, if a

request references a binary called file” name “here, the escaping algorithm will

generate the command line string “file” name “here”, which will invoke the binary

named file, not the one that the user requested.

```
if (execCmd.length() > 0 && execCmd.charAt(0) != '"' && execCmd.contains(" "))
execCmd = "\"" + execCmd + "\"";
```
### Exploit Scenario

The cgi-bin directory contains a binary named exec and a subdirectory named exec”

commands, which contains a file called bin1. The user sends to the CGI servlet a request

for the filename exec” commands/bin1. This request will pass the file existence check on

lines 194 through 205. The servlet will add quotation marks around this filename, resulting

in the command line string “exec” commands/bin1”. When this string is passed to

Runtime.exec, instead of executing the bin1 binary, the server will execute the exec

binary with the argument commands/file1”. In addition to being incorrect, this behavior

may bypass alias checks, and it may cause other unintended behaviors if a command prefix

is configured.

If the useFullPath configuration setting is off, the command need not pass the existence

check. The attack would not rely on a binary and subdirectory having similar names, and

the attack will succeed on a much wider variety of directory structures.

### Impact

Users of the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet with a very specific command structure may have the wrong command executed.

### Patches

No patch.

In Jetty 9.x, 10.x, and 11.x the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` has been deprecated.

In Jetty 12 (all environments) the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` has been entirely removed.

### Workarounds

The `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet should not be used. Fast CGI support is available instead.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
