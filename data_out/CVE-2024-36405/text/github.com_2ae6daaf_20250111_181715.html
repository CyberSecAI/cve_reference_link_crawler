# Control-flow timing leak in Kyber reference implementation when compiled with Clang 15-18 for -Os, -O1 and other options

Moderate

## Package

liboqs

## Affected versions

<=0.10.0

## Patched versions

0.10.1 and higher

## Description

liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms.

## Impact

A control-flow timing leak has been identified in the reference implementation of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism when it is compiled with Clang 15-18 for `-Os`, `-O1`, and other compilation options.

A proof-of-concept local attack on the reference implementation leaks the entire ML-KEM 512 secret key in ~10 minutes using end-to-end decapsulation timing measurements.

## Patches

Fixed in version 0.10.1 and main branch of liboqs on GitHub.

* [982c762](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/982c762c242ef549c914891b47bf6e0ed6321f91)

## Workarounds

Some compiler options may produce vectorized code that does not leak secret information, however relying on these compiler options as a workaround may not be reliable.

## References

* [pq-crystals/kyber@9b8d306](https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/commit/9b8d30698a3e7449aeb34e62339d4176f11e3c6c)

## Further details

The function [`poly_frommsg`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/7eecda6095c003ddded7175a1ffdf35a2ce63ed5/src/kem/kyber/pqcrystals-kyber_kyber512_ref/poly.c#L166) produces a polynomial based on the bits of the message m. Given that m is sensitive in both the encapsulation and decapsulation procedure, it is crucial that the implementation does not leak the bits of m through timing. Despite the source-level mitigations in poly\_frommsg, the latest generations of Clang recognize that the code essentially performs a bit test and produces a secret-dependent branch for several compiler options.

The following compiler options when used with Clang 15, 16, 17, and 18 on x86 produce a branch:

* `-Os`
* `-O1`
* `-O2 -fno-vectorize`
* `-O3 -fno-vectorize`

## Credits

The vulnerability was identified by Antoon Purnal (PQShield). A patch was developed by Peter Schwabe (MPI-SP).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
