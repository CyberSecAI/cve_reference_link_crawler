Could this be vulnerable to link-time optimizations with `-flto`?

Yes. In fact, what I wrote as a reply to Antoon Purnal when he pointed
out the issue was
"I guess an obvious fix is to implement a cmov in a separate file and
call it from poly\_frommsg. Then the compiler cannot apply the
optimization, because it doesn't know that the last argument is always
either zero or one (well, at least if you don't compile with -lto)."
Some other fixes have now been suggested that will also work with -flto
(see, e.g., PR 78 and pqc-forum posts by DJB and Falko Strenzke
suggesting to use an additional volatile mask).
I will probably integrate one of those, although all "solutions"
(including my own of splitting across files) are very hacky workarounds
owed to the fact that compilers like clang and gcc are not security
aware.

Sorry, something went wrong.
