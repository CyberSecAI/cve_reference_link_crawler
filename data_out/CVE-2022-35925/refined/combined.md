# Missing Critical Step in Authentication in bookwyrm

Critical

[mouse-reeve](/mouse-reeve)
published
GHSA-jvp3-mqv8-5rjw
Aug 2, 2022

## Package

bookwyrm
(application)

## Affected versions

< 0.4.5

## Patched versions

0.4.5

## Description

### Impact

Lack of rate limiting on authentication views allows brute-force attacks.

### Patches

Patched in version 0.4.5. Admins with existing instances will need to update their `nginx.conf` file that was created when the instance was set up.

### Workarounds

Admins can update their nginx.conf files with the changes manually.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-35925
