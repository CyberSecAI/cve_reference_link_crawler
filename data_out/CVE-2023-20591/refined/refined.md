Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-20591:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper re-initialization of the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) during a DRTM (Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement) event.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the IOMMU is re-initialized after a DRTM event. Due to this improper re-initialization, an untrusted platform configuration can persist.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to:
- Read hypervisor memory.
- Modify hypervisor memory.
This can lead to a loss of:
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Availability

**Attack vectors:**
The attack involves exploiting the improper IOMMU re-initialization during a DRTM event.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to influence the platform configuration, which is considered "untrusted" in the context of this vulnerability. The attacker needs to trigger the DRTM event.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.5.
- The attack vector is network based (AV:N).
- The attack complexity is high (AC:H).
- No privileges are required (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N)
- Scope is changed (S:C).
- Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability is low (C:L, I:L, A:L).
- The affected products are the 3rd and 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ processors. The 1st and 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ processors are not affected by this vulnerability.
- Mitigation involves updating the Platform Initialization (PI) firmware.
- Specifically for the 3rd Gen EPYC, the minimum firmware version to mitigate this CVE is MilanPI 1.0.0.B (2023-06-08), while for the 4th Gen it's Genoa 1.0.0.8 (2023-06-09).
