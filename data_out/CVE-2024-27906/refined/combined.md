When `requires_access_dag` is used with `access_entity` specified, it can lead to some inconsistencies. `requires_access_dag` should check whether the user is authorized to read/edit at least one DAG (line 155) only when no `access_entity` is specified.

I just checked and realized that we don't have unit tests for these generic security helpers, it would be great if we could add some tests to (1) ensure they work as expected and (2) validate a bugfix like this one.

(The tests could be added later in a separate PR)

Sorry, something went wrong.
