Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3575:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow located in the `sycc420_to_rgb` function within the `color.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. Specifically, the issue occurs at line 379, column 42. The root cause is insufficient validation of the `*cb` value, which leads to out-of-bounds read when decompressing a crafted J2K file, this occurs when x0 and y0 values are odd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: Reading past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious .j2k file that, when decompressed, triggers the buffer overflow. This could allow the attacker to execute code with the privileges of the application linked with the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.
-  Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability could also lead to a denial-of-service condition, if the overflow causes the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to have access to the local system to execute the crafted j2k file.
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious j2k file to a vulnerable application linked with the OpenJPEG library, which processes user supplied images for decompression.
 
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted j2k file to the application using the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger this vulnerability, however user interaction is required.
- An attacker would need to have some knowledge on how the openjpeg library works to craft the malicious j2k file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the decompression of a specially crafted .j2k file.
- The issue affects multiple versions of the OpenJPEG library, including versions 2.3.1 to 2.4.0 and current master.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 severity score of 7.8 (High).
- Patches were created for the vulnerability, and have been included in updated packages for various linux distributions.
- The fix was implemented and merged into the project via the pull request [#1509](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/pull/1509) with commit `7bd884f`.
