### Description

The Post Grid Gutenberg Blocks and WordPress Blog Plugin – PostX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'postx\_presets\_callback' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to change arbitrary options on affected sites. This can be used to enable new user registration and set the default role for new users to Administrator.
