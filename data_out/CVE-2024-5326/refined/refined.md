Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-5326:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `postx_presets_callback` function of the PostX plugin. This function is accessible via a REST API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The `postx_presets_callback` function, intended for managing PostX presets, lacks a proper authorization check. This allows any authenticated user, including those with low-level privileges like "Contributor," to access the function.
- **Arbitrary Option Updates:** The `postx_presets_callback` function is designed to update WordPress options. Due to the missing authorization check, attackers can use this function to modify arbitrary options.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating options, an attacker with Contributor-level access can potentially grant themselves administrative privileges. This can be achieved by enabling user registration and setting the default role for new users to "Administrator."
- **Site Compromise:** Once an attacker has admin access, they can take full control of the WordPress website. This may involve injecting malicious code, defacing the site, stealing sensitive data, or using it for other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `/postx_presets/` REST API endpoint.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site.
- **Low-Level Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by users with "Contributor" level access, or higher.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the WordPress site's REST API.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `Styles.php` file of the PostX plugin, specifically within the `postx_presets_callback` function.
- The vulnerability is present in all PostX plugin versions up to and including 4.1.2.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 4.1.3.
