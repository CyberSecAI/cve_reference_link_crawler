- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed in this document but it's likely that the vulnerability is triggered by a malicious crafted file or input processed by the vulnerable software, given that User Interaction is required (UI:R) according to the CVSS vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to entice a user to open a malicious crafted file or input. The vulnerability can be exploited locally (AV:L), and does not require privileges (PR:N).
