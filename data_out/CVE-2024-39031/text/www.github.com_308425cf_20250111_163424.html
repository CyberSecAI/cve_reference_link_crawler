### @mmoqui **[mmoqui](/mmoqui)** commented [Jun 12, 2024](#issue-2349144577)

Fix vulnerability by introducing injection checking in entity embodied within incoming HTTP requests.

The checking is performed only if the request embodies a web entity encoded in a supported content type, id est in JSON or in XML.

Sorry, something went wrong.
