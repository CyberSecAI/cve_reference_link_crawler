{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating calendar events.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Titre' and 'Description' fields of calendar events. This code executes when a user, including administrators, views their profile, calendar, or information feeds, leading to potential privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A standard user creates a calendar event with malicious XSS payloads in the title and description fields.",
       "The user then adds other users to the event, including administrators.",
       "When the invited user (victim) views their own profile or associated data, the payload is executed."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A standard user account is required to create a calendar event. The attacker needs to be able to invite other users, including administrators."
