{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing capability check on the `restore()` and `get_restore_progress()` functions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing authorization, leading to unauthorized access of data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated attackers can invoke these functions and obtain full file paths if they have access to a back-up ID.",
  "Attack vectors": "Invoking vulnerable functions via HTTP requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Access to a back-up ID, no authentication needed."
