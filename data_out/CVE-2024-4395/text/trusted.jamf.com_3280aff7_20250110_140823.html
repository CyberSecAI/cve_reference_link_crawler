Regulated industries and government agencies that handle sensitive or classified data are required by their InfoSec teams to harden and secure endpoints as much as possible.

Other organizations may not need the highest security possible, but may still want to achieve a custom level of security they can track and enforce.

Staying on top of all the changes and features in every macOS, iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS release is cumbersome and time-consuming and may lead to data leaks or exfiltration.

Various government entities and organizations have provided guidance that details settings/controls that should be reviewed when developing security compliance policies. These are known as security benchmarks. A benchmark is a set of best-practice cybersecurity standards for a range of IT systems and products.

Your organization may choose to develop its own security benchmark or may be required to adopt one of the well-known security benchmarks or baselines including CIS, NIST 800-53 & 800-171, DISA STIG, CNSSI, indigo, or CMMC.
