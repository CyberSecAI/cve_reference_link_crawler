Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue within the Perfmatters WordPress plugin. This means that there are missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is described as "moderately dangerous" and "expected to become exploited".
*   An unprivileged user (specifically mentioned as a "Subscriber") could potentially execute higher-privileged actions, which could lead to various consequences depending on the specific vulnerable functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting the broken access control by sending crafted requests to the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be at least a "Subscriber" user role. This means the attacker needs to have some level of access to the WordPress site, though not necessarily administrative.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects Perfmatters plugin versions <= 2.1.6.
*   The fix is available in version 2.1.7.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability until the plugin is updated.
