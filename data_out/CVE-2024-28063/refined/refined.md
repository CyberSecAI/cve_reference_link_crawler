- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `envelopeRecipient` parameter in the `EnvelopeOpenServlet` is vulnerable to reflected XSS because its value is included in the server response without sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML page returned by the server, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser when they open a crafted email attachment. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the `envelopeRecipient` parameter. This URL would typically be embedded within a malicious HTML attachment (Registered Envelope) sent to the victim. When the victim opens the HTML attachment in a browser without JavaScript enabled, it triggers the vulnerable server response which then executes the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted email attachment to a target user. The attacker doesn't need any prior access to the web application. The user must open the crafted email attachment in a browser without Javascript enabled to be vulnerable.
