{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The powerpc kernel is not prepared to handle exec faults from the kernel itself. The `is_exec_fault()` function incorrectly identifies kernel exec faults because it relies on `current->thread.regs->trap` which contains the trap from user space.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of kernel-initiated execute faults.",
      "The `is_exec_fault()` function incorrectly identifies kernel exec faults."
    ],
    "impact": "A minor exec fault occurs repeatedly, leading to a kernel lockup or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the kernel attempts to execute code in a memory region that does not have the `PAGE_EXEC` flag set. This can be triggered by the LKDTM EXEC_USERSPACE test, or any similar scenario where the kernel attempts to execute code within a user space address that lacks execute permission.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger a kernel execution fault on a page without execute permissions. This could be caused by kernel bugs or by specific test conditions like the LKDTM EXEC_USERSPACE test."
  },
  "details": "The `is_exec_fault()` function returns `false` when an exec fault is taken by kernel, because the check is based on reading `current->thread.regs->trap` which contains the trap from user. When an exec fault happens in kernel, `set_access_flags_filter()` is supposed to set the `PAGE_EXEC` flag. However, because `is_exec_fault()` returns false, `set_access_flags_filter()` bails out and the flag is never set, causing an infinite loop of the same minor fault."
