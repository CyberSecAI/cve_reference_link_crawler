- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input leads to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerabilities are present in two specific locations:
    -  `/deal/{id}/note` endpoint, via the `notes` parameter
    - `/project/task/{task_id}/show` endpoint, via the `comment` parameter
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow attackers to perform:
    - Phishing and malware deployment
    - User impersonation
    - Data theft
    - Other malicious activities
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker with low privileges can inject malicious JavaScript into the vulnerable parameters. The script is then executed when other users, including administrators, view the pages containing the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have an authenticated, low-privileged account on the CRMGo SaaS platform to exploit these vulnerabilities.
