Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `com.google.guava:guava` dependency within the `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-shade` dependency.
- The included guava dependency creates temporary directories with unsafe permissions during test execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unsafe Permissions:** Temporary directories created by the affected guava library have insecure permissions, potentially allowing other local users to access or modify them.
- **Local Information Disclosure:** Due to the insecure permissions, local users could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored within these temporary directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers who have local access to the system can potentially read sensitive data from the temporary directories.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable Spring Cloud Contract application is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Local user account on the system running the affected Spring Cloud Contract version.

**Affected Versions:**

- Spring Cloud Contract:
    - 4.1.0
    - 4.0.0 to 4.0.5
    - 3.1.0 to 3.1.10

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Spring Cloud Contract versions 3.1.10, 4.0.5, or 4.1.1, which contain the fix for this vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as **LOW** severity.
- The vulnerability is present due to a shaded dependency (`com.google.guava:guava`) within Spring Cloud Contract.
- The referenced CVE-2020-8908 seems to be related to the issue of guava creating temporary directory with unsafe permissions.
