{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap buffer overflow",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unspecified, likely arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "DevTools.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to utilize or access DevTools. This may require the attacker to have the ability to open DevTools (e.g., by using the browser's UI or command line interface) and potentially interact with it in a way that triggers the overflow."
