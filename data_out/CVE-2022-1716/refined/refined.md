- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control allows bypassing the application's password/pin lock.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access to the victim's device can bypass the application's lock and access user data.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device is required. The attacker uses Frida to hook and dynamically rewrite the `run` function of the LockScreenActivity class.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the victim's device, knowledge of how to use Frida to perform code injection and hooking.
