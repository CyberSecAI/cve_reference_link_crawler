Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an insufficient session expiration mechanism in FortiDeceptor. Specifically, the fsuis token does not expire after a user logs out.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Session Expiration:** The core issue is that the admin user's session IDs (tokens) remain valid even after the user has logged out. This allows for potential reuse of the token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who obtains a valid, unexpired session ID can use it to gain administrative privileges on the FortiDeceptor system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The content mentions that the attacker needs to obtain the session ID via other hypothetical attacks, which is not explicitly detailed. This suggests a prerequisite compromise is needed before this vulnerability can be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to somehow obtain a valid, unexpired session ID. The means of obtaining the session ID are not defined in this document and would require other vulnerabilities or compromised system.
- The attacker needs to be able to use the obtained session ID to access the FortiDeceptor system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects FortiDeceptor version 3.0.0 and below.
- The fix is to upgrade to FortiDeceptor version 3.1.0 or above.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSSv3 score of 7.1.
