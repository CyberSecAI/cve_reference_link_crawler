### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Any user running source commits [3fa8bbf](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/3fa8bbf237e3378090f660079eb42ab4629b4d13), [1bda8d1](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/1bda8d191652c901613378e938775ca4717b9077), [12a9590](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/12a95900d7e2b84f834fc9de8f5d3a9955261bc9), [428b361](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/428b36116139adea3b379b9a88de590e4c6b33fc), [34fb194](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/34fb194a6899181aade719ca5d81278019fbbf69), [b521636](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/b5216361f5bd6df92dd85030f9136ff424fcc5ce), [ef3583e](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/ef3583e98d728a984aadc8d3cae57c38ec0329e1), [f5efa6a](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/f5efa6a967fbf6971c321fcc574cf431b3b4ad9f), [1eb1e54](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/1eb1e5428f0926b2829a0bbbb65b0d946e608593), and [cbcea0a](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/cbcea0a2c3e21f3a80675576792e783da59457cd) are vulnerable.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

~~There are no published patches as of yet.~~ As of commit [cdcd48b](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/cdcd48bbc44009ddcbd07a809b87376dc9ce37f4) the issue has been fixed. Users on patches between [3fa8bbf](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/3fa8bbf237e3378090f660079eb42ab4629b4d13) and [cbcea0a](https://github.com/benjjvi/iTunesRPC-Remastered/commit/cbcea0a2c3e21f3a80675576792e783da59457cd) are advised to update as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Users can manually modify the source code to ensure that the image\_file variable is evaluated with ast.literal\_eval to convert to a string, then passed through werkzeug.utils.secure\_filename to ensure the filename is correct. The manually modified source should look like this;

```
    [module/connect_to_server.py]
    [...]
    from html import unescape
    import werkzeug.utils

    import requests

    image_file = str(image_file).replace("DOT", ".") # <-- modified line

    api = f"http://{domain}:7873/bGVhdmVfcmlnaHRfbm93"
    [...]
```

This modification also requires itunesrpc.py to be modified to pass through file names, not file paths.

```
    [itunesrpc.py]
    [...]
    # MODIFY TRACK TO HAVE PAUSED IF PAUSED ON APPLE MUSIC
    if paused_track:
        track = "[PAUSED] " + track

    file_path = os.getcwd() + "\\temporary.png" # <- pay attention to this line
    o.CurrentTrack.Artwork.Item(1).SaveArtworkToFile(file_path)

    artwork_url = networking.get("temporaryDOTpng", domain, track, artist, album) # <- pay attention to this line
    artwork_url = ast.literal_eval(str(artwork_url))
    [...]
```

Although this modification is "quick and dirty" it gets the job done. It is the definition of "spaghetti code" and will be fixed to be properly written before the release of debug.4.0.0

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
