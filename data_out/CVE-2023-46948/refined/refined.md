Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the 'skin' parameter in the Temenos T24 application. Specifically, the `about.jsp` and `genrequest.jsp` files are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects the unsanitized value of the 'skin' parameter directly in the HTML output, making it possible to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session while they are using the Temenos T24 application. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the user.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data handled by the application.
    - **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or content of the web page being viewed.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Serving malware to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The attacker would craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the 'skin' parameter and trick the victim into clicking it (e.g. via social engineering or phishing).
- **Compromised Site:** If the vulnerable application is accessible via a third-party, or even an internal site, an attacker could leverage that site to inject the payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable Temenos T24 application.
- **Social Engineering or Compromise:** The attacker needs a way to deliver a malicious URL to the victim or compromise a system with access to the application.
- **No Authentication Required (for exploitation):** While the victim needs to be authenticated to use the vulnerable components of T24, no specific authentication is needed by the attacker to craft and send the malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes example request/response pairs that showcase the vulnerability with a simple alert box payload. This demonstrates how the 'skin' parameter allows for injection of script tags.
- The vulnerability affects Temenos T24 version R19.40.
- The affected files are `/BrowserWebR19/jsps/about.jsp` and `/BrowserWebR19/jsps/genrequest.jsp`.
- The remediation status is not provided in the content, but the timeline indicates a report date to the vendor on 19/10/2023.
