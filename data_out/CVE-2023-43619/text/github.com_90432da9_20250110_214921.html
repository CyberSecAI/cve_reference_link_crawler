| If more than one file is transferred via Croc then, before the transfer starts, the receiver only sees a summary line about the files about to be received, like:  ``` Accept 2 files (159 B)? (Y/n)  ```  Only after confirming this dialog the full file reception list will be printed, like:  ``` Receiving (<-[ip]:[port]) file1 100% |████████████████████| (140/140 B, 610 B/s) 1/2 file2 100% |████████████████████| ( 0/ 1 B) 2/2  ```  The Croc protocol allows the sender to specify arbitrary paths to be transferred. Via social engineering an attacker could attempt to transfer one or more malicious files in a larger file list, that otherwise looks unsuspicious.  There is a file overwrite check in Croc that prevents existing files from being overwritten without user consent (at least by default, there's the `--overwrite` switch to disable the prompt). For not yet existing files there are no security boundaries though. So if e.g. `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` is not existing yet on the receiver side, then the sender can transfer this, maybe unnoticed by the receiver. Even if the receiver notices it after the fact, it might be too late, and the attacker already had the chance to compromise the receiver's system.  Two relevant pieces of information might be missing for an attacker in this scenario: the receiver's home directory location and its current working directory. Guessing or determining the receiver's home directory path via social engineering might be well within reach though.imply implying that the CWD is the home directory might otherwise be a good guess. Also relative paths like `../.ssh/authorized_keys` can be transferred. An attacker has to be careful about this, though, because if the path reaches above the home directory, then "permission denied" errors will become visible on the receiver end, which are more likely to raise alarm.  Fixing this kind of attack scenario is difficult, when trying to parse incoming file paths and to detect dangerous situations in userspace. Especially since there is also the possibility of symlinks and Croc even explicitly supports the creation of symlinks in its protocol. In other file transfer tools like [Warpinator](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/26/1) the developers ended up using isolation techniques to lock the receiver process side in a specific download directory.  Using mount namespaces (ideally an existing tool for creating a namespace jail) or Linux features like Landlock is probably the best solution for this problem. Since Croc is cross platform, implementing isolation can become a large effort though, since there are no shared APIs available for this. |

| [@aspann](https://github.com/aspann) You are asking this on multiple tickets, when the original poster didn't even include an affected version. The advisories in question were written by GitHub proper, not the vendor. So take any advisory issues up with them first since they are making specific claims to versions affected (they won't see your comments most likely). Otherwise, please show why you feel that e.g. 9.6.6, or any other version, should or should not be included in the affected range. The owner of the project only spoke to it being difficult to solve cross-platform, they did not confirm or deny any versions being affected. |

| Shouldn't [CVE-2023-43619](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ppjh-xp5v-46wc) cover 9.6.6 as well?  The GitHub advisory references the [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43619) entry for this issue, where the statement is included that `versions through 9.6.5` are affected. At the time the CVEs have been filed the issues have not yet been fixed. Meanwhile a new release is available still without fixes. The CVE database has not been updated with this new information, or maybe they completely missed the fact that no fix is available currently.  Once a fix is available an update can be submitted to Mitre to note the actual version that has a fix available. |

| [@mgerstner](https://github.com/mgerstner) looking back at this issue, I don't think its applicable.  relative paths like ../.ssh/authorized\_keys can be transferred  this is actually not true. if `A` sends `../.ssh` then `B` will receive it in their current folder, not in `..` folder. there is only one way to overwrite `~./ssh` and that is to tell the receiver to `cd` into `~` before they receive the file. this is not very subtle in terms of attacks and brings me to the basis of this issue -  Via social engineering an attacker could attempt  `croc`, by design, needs two people to communicate to transfer files. if you are suggesting that one of those two people could be an attacker - it is as possible. however, that is also true for pretty much any two people communicating with each other to run programs on their computers. `A` could ask `B` to run `curl X | bash` and `B`'s computer is instantly compromised. or a myriad of other commands as well.  do `curl` and `bash` and `wget` and all those tools also have a responsibility to prevent a social engineering attack as well? I could easily design the same scenario that you suggest with those tools. |

The paths communicated by the sender are not limited on the receiving side. I just tested it once more using this minor change to the code on the sender's side:  ``` diff --git a/src/croc/croc.go b/src/croc/croc.go index a4e23a1..94a75c4 100644 --- a/src/croc/croc.go +++ b/src/croc/croc.go @@ -451,7 +451,7 @@ func GetFilesInfo(fnames []string, zipfolder bool, ignoreGit bool) (filesInfo []                 } else {                         fInfo := FileInfo{                                 Name:         stat.Name(), -                               FolderRemote: "./", +                               FolderRemote: "../",                                 FolderSource: filepath.Dir(absPath),                                 Size:         stat.Size(),                                 ModTime:      stat.ModTime(),  ```  When receiving a file from this client then the download will happen in the folder `../`.  Via social engineering an attacker could attempt  `croc`, by design, needs two people to communicate to transfer files. if you are suggesting that one of those two people could be an attacker - it is as possible. however, that is also true for pretty much any two people communicating with each other to run programs on their computers. `A` could ask `B` to run `curl X | bash` and `B`'s computer is instantly compromised. or a myriad of other commands as well.  Of course I consider the scenario that the person I'm exchanging files with might have bad intentions. It's my job. If there would be no attacker then we could stop worrying alltogether, right?  do `curl` and `bash` and `wget` and all those tools also have a responsibility to prevent a social engineering attack as well? I could easily design the same scenario that you suggest with those tools.  The programs that you name here are general purpose tools used by experts. `croc` states about itself:  Easily and securely send things from one computer to another  A command line program these days can still be considered tailored at least for power users. However, the statement above, in my mind, gives a certain promise. Simplicity and security. Two things that are difficult to combine at times.  If the security that is provided here is only related to what happens on the wire i.e. the protection against a third party listening in or meddling on the network then I believe this restriction has to be documented more clearly. You should clearly state that you don't consider the scenario that the person sending data to you might be harmful. Because that is the main security problem to solve IMHO when looking at tools that allow to decentrally transfer data between arbitrary parties.  As an expert I'd say `croc` cannot be tasked with protecting me from the *content* that is transfered onto my computer, since it can be anything. But it should protect me from data appearing in uncontrolled places. There should be a clear and transparent workflow what files are received and where they are placed. |

| A could ask B to run curl X | bash and B's computer is instantly compromised  A more apt comparison would be "A could ask B to run curl X, and curl would deceitfully save X in another folder". You see how that would be problematic, and would be classified as a vulnerability.  Users can hurt themselves with any tool of their choice. The point is whether the tool in question allows users to be hurt inadvertently or deceitfully. |

I'm not quite sure what you mean. Are you suggesting that I should fix it?  More importantly I don't see this as an easy fix. Please refer to the original issue text. There are many ways a receiving can be tricked into creating files in unexpected places. Relative path components are one of them. Symlinks are another. ZIP file extraction is yet another. |

| I just looked at the bugfix for this and found that it only partially adresses the problem:   * sending an arbitrary hidden file or directory still works, except if it is ".ssh". Blacklisting single paths like this one doesn't really help that much. So what if I send over a ".bashrc" or ".config/chromium/Safe Browsing Cookies" instead? * if a hidden file like .bashrc doesn't exist yet, then it can still silently be created, otherwise there's an overwrite confirmation. * placing ".." elements in the file basename (`FileInfo.Name`) still works, although they will   be visible (if only one file is sent). The basename should be verified not to contain any directory separators and it shouldn't start with any dots. * sending absolute paths is still possible like /well/known/path/evil.file. * symlinks containing ../ may still be followed, although an overwrite prompt will occur. So I can send `link -> ../.bashrc` and then `link` with evil content. * symlinks to directories still work well: Sending something like `backlink -> ../` and then sending a file `backlink/.bashrc` will escape the CWD.   Overall I really think that `croc` should restrict itself to a dedicated incoming directory. Isolation mechanisms like a separate mount namespace are recommended, that prevent writing outside of that dedicated directory. |
