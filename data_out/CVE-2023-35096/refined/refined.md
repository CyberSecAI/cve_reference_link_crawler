- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The myCred plugin for WordPress versions 2.5 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions on the website while authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could potentially force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted web request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin. This requires the victim to be authenticated and tricked into initiating a request to the vulnerable site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request and then convince an authenticated user to trigger this request.
