Subject: CVE-2024-41888: Apache Answer: The link for resetting user
 password is not Single-Use

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Answer through 1.3.5

Description:

Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in Apache Answer.

This issue affects Apache Answer: through 1.3.5.

The password reset link remains valid within its expiration period even after it has been used. This could potentially lead to the link being misused or hijacked.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.3.6, which fixes the issue.
