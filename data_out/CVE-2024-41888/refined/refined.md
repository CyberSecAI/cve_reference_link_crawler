- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime. Specifically, the password reset link remains valid even after being used.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The password reset link is not invalidated after its first use, making it reusable within its expiration period.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could misuse or hijack a password reset link if they obtain it. This could lead to unauthorized access to an account.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could intercept the reset link, or if a user accidentally shares the link, the attacker could use it to reset the password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid password reset link generated for a legitimate user.
