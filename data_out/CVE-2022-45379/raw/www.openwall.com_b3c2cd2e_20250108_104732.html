Support Core Plugin defines the permission Support/DownloadBundle that
allows users without Overall/Administer permission to create and download
support bundles containing a limited set of diagnostic information.

Support Core Plugin 1206.v14049fa_b_d860 and earlier does not correctly
perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Support/DownloadBundle permission to download a
previously created support bundle containing information limited to users
with Overall/Administer permission.


SECURITY-2094 / CVE-2022-45384
Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin 1.7.3 and earlier stores the LDAP manager
password unencrypted in the global `config.xml` file on the Jenkins
controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by attackers with access to the Jenkins
controller file system.


SECURITY-2843 / CVE-2022-45385
CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin provides several webhook
endpoints that can be used to trigger builds when Docker images used by a
job have been rebuilt.

In CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin 2.6.2 and earlier,
these endpoints can be accessed without authentication.

This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs
corresponding to the attacker-specified repository.


SECURITY-766 / CVE-2022-45386
Violations Plugin 0.7.11 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers to to control XML input files for the 'Report
Violations' post-build step to have agent processes parse a crafted file
that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins
agent or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2802 / CVE-2022-45387
BART Plugin 1.0.3 and earlier does not escape the parsed content of build
logs before rendering it on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2842 / CVE-2022-45388
Config Rotator Plugin 2.0.1 and earlier does not restrict a file name query
parameter in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files with `.xml`
extension on the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2853 / CVE-2022-45389
XP-Dev Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/xpdev-webhook` that can be
used to trigger builds configured to use a specified repository.

In XP-Dev Plugin 1.0 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed without
authentication.

This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs
corresponding to an attacker-specified repository.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2857 / CVE-2022-45390
loader.io Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in
an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2910 (1) / CVE-2022-45391
NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.143 and earlier
globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate and hostname
validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.


SECURITY-2910 (2) / CVE-2022-38666
NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.146 and earlier
unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation for
several features.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2912 / CVE-2022-45392
NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.143 and earlier stores
passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller
as part of its configuration.

These passwords can be viewed by attackers with Item/Extended Read
permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.


SECURITY-2920 / CVE-2022-45393 (CSRF) &amp; CVE-2022-45394 (missing permission check)
Delete log Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an
HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to delete build logs.

Additionally, this HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting
in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2921 / CVE-2022-45395
CCCC Plugin 0.6 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent
XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control the contents of the report file for
the 'Publish CCCC Report' post-build step to have agent processes parse a
crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the
Jenkins agent or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2927 / CVE-2022-45396
SourceMonitor Plugin 0.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
