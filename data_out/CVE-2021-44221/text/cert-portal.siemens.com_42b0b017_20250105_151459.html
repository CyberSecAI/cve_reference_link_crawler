GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC eaSie is a digital assistant for automation and process control technology in the Siemens
automation concept, "Totally Integrated Automation".

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44221

The affected systems do not properly validate input that is sent to the underlying message passing
framework. This could allow a remote attacker to trigger a denial of service of the affected system.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.5
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44222

The underlying MQTT service of affected systems does not perform authentication in the default
conﬁguration. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send arbitrary messages to the
service and thereby issue arbitrary requests in the affected system.
