## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

| [#33558 (comment)](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33558#issuecomment-554879181) reports a situation in which a `v2.0.0` branch was created and subsequently removed, but `proxy.golang.org` cached a `v2.0.0+incompatible` release.  If someone creates a *branch* named `v2.0.0`, they probably intend for that branch to contain the development *leading up to* `v2.0.0`, not for that branch as first published to be the definitive final release of `v2.0.0`. The `go` command should not mistake the former for the latter.  CC [@jayconrod](https://github.com/jayconrod) [@mattn](https://github.com/mattn) [@thepudds](https://github.com/thepudds) |

| [@gopherbot](https://github.com/gopherbot) please open backport issues. Materializing versions from branches might be unexpected and bypass ACLs that limit the creation of tags but not branches. It's also better for the version list to be consistent across supported Go versions. |

I don't know when the default Cache-Control policy was added, but it
makes it very difficult to fix mistakes in zipfiles uploaded to

how to fix it, if the user remembers to do so.

`[[release-branch.go1.17] cmd/go/internal/modfetch: do not short-circui…](/golang/go/commit/fbcc30a2c9d076b27b4b411e2cec91ec13528081 "[release-branch.go1.17] cmd/go/internal/modfetch: do not short-circuit canonical versions

Since at least CL 121857, the conversion logic in
(*modfetch).codeRepo.Stat has had a short-circuit to use the version
requested by the caller if it successfully resolves and is already
canonical.

However, we should not use that version if it refers to a branch
instead of a tag, because branches (unlike tags) usually do not refer
to a single, stable release: a branch named \"v1.0.0\" may be for the
development of the v1.0.0 release, or for the development of patches
based on v1.0.0, but only one commit (perhaps at the end of that
branch — but possibly not even written yet!) can be that specific
version.

We already have some logic to prefer tags that are semver-equivalent
to the version requested by the caller. That more general case
suffices for exact equality too — so we can eliminate the
special-case, fixing the bug and (happily!) also somewhat simplifying
the code.

| Is it expected that your local modules cache and proxy.golang.org continue to serve these types of 'bad' versions? My guess is yes, including to support reproducible builds, but wanted to confirm.  One related comment is it looks like rsc.io/quote might have deliberately tried to introduce this problem late last year, or at least it currently seems to have a v4.0.0 branch without a v4.0.0 tag, and proxy.golang.org serves v4.0.0 as a version:  [https://proxy.golang.org/rsc.io/quote/v4/@v/list](https://proxy.golang.org/rsc.io/quote/v4/%40v/list)  It also seems go1.17.7 will be OK with these types of versions if your local module cache has been polluted:  ``` export GOMODCACHE=$(mktemp -d) export GOPROXY=direct cd $(mktemp -d) go mod init temp  # go1.17.7 fails with the expected new error: #     rsc.io/quote/v4@v4.0.0: invalid version: resolves to version v4.0.0-20211101134634-bc30624959ad (v4.0.0 is not a tag)  go1.17.7 get rsc.io/quote/v4@v4.0.0  # go1.17.6 succeeds: go1.17.6 get rsc.io/quote/v4@v4.0.0  rm go.mod go mod init temp  # go1.17.7 now also succeeds in adding rsc.io/quote/v4@v4.0.0, presumably due to module cache: go1.17.7 get rsc.io/quote/v4@v4.0.0  ```  Again, probably expected, but wanted to check.  The new v4 also happens to now show up in one of the modules tutorials, which might mean a tweak to the tutorial ([#51188](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51188)) if the proxy will continue to serve that v4 version.  Finally, sorry if any of this is off base or if I've forgotten something obvious. |

My guess is yes, including to support reproducible builds, but wanted to confirm. … It also seems go1.17.7 will be OK with these types of versions if your local module cache has been polluted:  Yes: any version that was already in the wild is already in the wild anyway; we don't have a mechanism to unpublish invalidated versions from module caches or proxies, although of course the author can `retract` the affected version(s) — see [mattn/go-sqlite3#998](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/pull/998) for an example.  The new v4 also happens to now show up in one of the modules tutorials, which might mean a tweak to the tutorial ([#51188](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51188)) if the proxy will continue to serve that v4 version.  Yeah, we should probably fix that. Thanks for flagging it! |

| [@jing-rui](https://github.com/jing-rui), per the Go project's [release policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy), only the two most recent Go releases receive backport fixes.  The only workarounds I'm aware of for older versions are to upgrade, or to configure your environment to use a `GOPROXY` that itself runs an upgraded or patched version of the `go` command. |

We have just released Go versions 1.17.7 and 1.16.14, minor point releases.

These minor releases include three security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* crypto/elliptic: fix IsOnCurve for big.Int values that are not valid coordinates

  Some big.Int values that are not valid field elements (negative or overflowing)
might cause Curve.IsOnCurve to incorrectly return true. Operating on those values
may cause a panic or an invalid curve operation. Note that Unmarshal will never
return such values.

Thanks to Guido Vranken for reporting this.

This is CVE-2022-23806 and <https://go.dev/issue/50974>.

* math/big: prevent large memory consumption in Rat.SetString

  An attacker can cause unbounded memory growth in a program using (\*Rat).SetString
  due to an unhandled overflow.

  Thanks to the OSS-Fuzz project for discovering this issue and to Emmanuel Odeke
  (@odeke\_et) for reporting it.

  This is CVE-2022-23772 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/50699>.

* cmd/go: prevent branches from materializing into versions

  A branch whose name resembles a version tag (such as "v1.0.0" or "subdir/v2.0.0-dev")
  can be considered a valid version by the go command. Materializing versions from
  branches might be unexpected and bypass ACLs that limit the creation of tags but not
  branches.

  This is CVE-2022-23773 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/35671>.

View the release notes for more information:
    <https://go.dev/doc/devel/release.html#go1.17.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:
    <https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
"git checkout go1.17.7" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
Cherry and Alex for the Go team
