{
  "CVE-2022-23773": {
    "Description": "A branch whose name resembles a version tag (such as \"v1.0.0\" or \"subdir/v2.0.0-dev\") can be considered a valid version by the go command. Materializing versions from branches might be unexpected and bypass ACLs that limit the creation of tags but not branches.",
    "Root cause": "The go command incorrectly interprets branches with semantic-version names as releases.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect interpretation of version control branches"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could create a branch that appears to be a valid version, potentially bypassing access control lists (ACLs) that restrict tag creation, leading to unexpected behavior and security issues during module resolution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Creating a branch with a name that resembles a semantic version tag in a Go module repository."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to create a branch in a repository.",
      "No authentication required to create the branch."
    ],
    "Additional Information": "This vulnerability can lead to unexpected behavior during module resolution and bypass ACLs that limit the creation of tags but not branches."
