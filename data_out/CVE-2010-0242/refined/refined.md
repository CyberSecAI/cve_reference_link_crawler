  "cve": "CVE-2010-0242",
  "description": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in TCP/IP processing in Microsoft Windows due to an error in the processing of specially crafted TCP packets with a malformed selective acknowledgment (SACK) value. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the target system a small number of specially crafted packets causing the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the Windows TCP/IP stack not properly handling malformed TCP SACK values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed TCP SACK values"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service. The affected system will stop responding and automatically restart.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker sends a small number of specially crafted TCP packets with a malformed selective acknowledgment (SACK) value to the target system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system."
