## ICMPv6 Router Advertisement Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0239

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows TCP/IP stack due to insufficient bounds checking when processing specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets to a computer with IPv6 enabled. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0239](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0239).

#### Mitigating Factors for ICMPv6 Router Advertisement Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0239

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for ICMPv6 Router Advertisement Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0239

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the "Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" inbound firewall rule**

  To disable this firewall rule, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  `netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" dir=in new enable=No`

  **Impact of workaround.** ICMPv6 router advertisements will be blocked. This could adversely impact IPv6 functionality in common deployment scenarios, where router discovery protocol is used for host configuration.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable this firewall rule, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  `netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" dir=in new enable=Yes`

#### FAQ for ICMPv6 Router Advertisement Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0239

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges on vulnerable systems. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the Windows TCP/IP stack not performing the appropriate level of bounds checking on specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the TechNet article, [Overview of networking and TCP/IP](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc739443%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is IPv6?**

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), a new suite of standard protocols for the network layer of the Internet, is built into Microsoft Windows XP and later. IPv6 is designed to solve many of the problems of the current version of IP (known as IPv4) such as address depletion, security, autoconfiguration, and extensibility. To learn more about IPv6, please see the TechNet site, [FAQ for IPv6](https://technet.microsoft.com/network/bb530961.aspx).

**What are Router Advertisements?**

Router Advertisements allow routers to instruct hosts how to perform Address Autoconfiguration. For example, routers can specify whether hosts should use DHCPv6 and/or autonomous (stateless) address configuration. Routers advertise their presence together with various link and Internet parameters either periodically, or in response to a Router Solicitation message. Router Advertisements contain prefixes that are used for determining whether another address shares the same link (on-link determination) and/or address configuration, a suggested hop limit value, etc. For more information about Router Advertisements and Neighbor Discovery in IPv6, see [RFC 4861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating specially crafted ICMPv6 packets and sending the packets to a system with IPv6 enabled. This vulnerability may only be exploited if the attacker is on-link. Tunneling protocols, such as ISATAP, may effectively allow attackers to deliver the corrupted packet to the target machine even if the attacker is not present on the same physical link.

**When is an attacker considered "on-link"?**

For purposes of this vulnerability, an attacker is considered on-link if they are on the same physical or virtual link and are able to send a valid neighbor discovery message to the target host. An example of a virtual link is one that occurs via an ISATAP tunnel. For more information about on-link addresses and Neighbor Discovery in IPv6, see [RFC 4861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All operating systems with the IPv6 features enabled are at risk from this vulnerability. By default all the supported features for IPv6 are enabled in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by changing the manner in which the Windows TCP/IP stack performs bounds checking on specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Header MDL Fragmentation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0240

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows TCP/IP stack due to the manner in which the TCP/IP stack handles specially crafted Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP) over UDP datagram fragments when running a custom network driver. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0240](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0240).

#### Mitigating Factors for Header MDL Fragmentation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0240

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability only impacts Windows systems if they have installed a custom network driver that splits the UDP header into multiple MDLs. Microsoft is not aware of any driver that takes this action.

#### Workarounds for Header MDL Fragmentation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0240

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature**

  To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature. You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).

#### FAQ for Header MDL Fragmentation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0240

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges on vulnerable systems. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the Windows TCP/IP stack not handling specially crafted IP datagram fragments when running a custom network driver.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the TechNet article, [Overview of networking and TCP/IP](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc739443%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is an Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)?**

Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality (in addition to authentication, integrity, and anti-replay protection) for the IP payload. ESP in transport mode does not sign the entire packet. Only the IP payload (not the IP header) is protected. ESP can be used alone or in combination with Authentication Header (AH).

**What is a Memory Descriptor List (MDL)?**

A memory descriptor list (MDL) is a system-defined structure that describes a buffer by a set of physical addresses. A driver that performs direct I/O receives a pointer to an MDL from the I/O manager, and reads and writes data through the MDL. Some drivers also use MDLs when they perform direct I/O to satisfy a device I/O control request. For more information about MDLs, see the Windows Hardware Developer Central article, [What is really in that MDL?](https://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/tips/mdl.mspx)

**Does this attack require the UDP traffic to be fragmented?**

No. This attack does not rely on fragmented network traffic. Instead, the fragmentation involved requires the network driver on the target system to fragment the UDP header into separate MDLs.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.
