The provided content is related to CVE-2022-42478.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts within FortiSIEM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts [CWE-307] allows an attacker to perform brute-force attacks on multiple endpoints.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to FortiSIEM by brute-forcing credentials due to the lack of proper protection against excessive login attempts.
- Successful exploitation leads to improper access control.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: An unauthenticated user with access to the FortiSIEM endpoints can attempt multiple login attempts

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the exposed endpoints of FortiSIEM.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the system.
