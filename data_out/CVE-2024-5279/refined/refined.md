{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The file renaming functionality in qiwen-file does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious code into file names.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "The injected malicious code is executed when a user accesses the directory containing the renamed file or when a user accesses a shared link to the file. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing actions on behalf of the user.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to have an account on the platform. They need to navigate to the cloud drive, create or upload a file, right-click to rename it, insert the XSS payload in the new file name field and confirm.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a valid account on the platform and the ability to create or upload files.",
        "additional_details": "The provided payload example is: <img src=\"\" onerror=\"alert(document.cookie)\">. This payload will execute Javascript which would pop an alert box containing the users cookies. The vulnerable code is triggered when accessing the directory containing the file, or when the file is shared and the victim visits the link."
