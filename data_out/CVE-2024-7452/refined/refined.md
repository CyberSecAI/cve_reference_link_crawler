Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the inadequate filtering of the `id` parameter in `view_company.php`, `view_drive.php`, and `view_student.php` pages. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code via the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `id` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   **Read sensitive data:** Access and retrieve potentially confidential information stored in the database.
    *   **Modify data:** Alter or delete data within the database.
    *   **Gain unauthorized access:** Potentially escalate privileges or gain access to other parts of the system.
    *   **Cause application downtime:** Injecting malicious code can cause errors and potentially lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests. The vulnerable `id` parameter is passed as part of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected pages (`view_company.php`, `view_drive.php`, `view_student.php`) and manipulate the `id` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection:
    *   **Payload:** `id=1' AND (SELECT 5490 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))qDPR) AND 'HyHB'='HyHB`
    *   This payload injects a `SLEEP(5)` function, which causes a 5-second delay in the response, indicating successful injection.
