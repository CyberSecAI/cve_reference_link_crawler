Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in spa-cartcmsv1.9.0.6:

**1. Business Logic Flaw**

*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user input for product quantities during the checkout process, allowing negative values to be submitted.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient input validation on the "amount" parameter when adding products to the cart.
    *   The application does not prevent the final price calculation from resulting in a negative value.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can manipulate the cart to have a negative subtotal. This may lead to unexpected behavior in the application's accounting or potentially allow bypassing payment requirements, although the provided example shows that the application prevents ordering below $10.00, the negative value might be exploited elsewhere.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Manipulating the `amount` parameter in the HTTP POST request to `/cart/add`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application's shopping cart functionality and intercept/modify HTTP requests.

**2. Username Enumeration**

*   **Root cause:** The application provides different responses based on whether a username exists or not when a login attempt with a wrong password occurs.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   The application returns a "P" message for a valid username with an incorrect password and an "E" message for an invalid username with an incorrect password.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can use this vulnerability to enumerate valid usernames in the system by observing the response code.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending HTTP POST requests to `/login` with different email values and observing the response ("P" or "E").
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker can be an unauthenticated user and only needs the ability to interact with the login page.
