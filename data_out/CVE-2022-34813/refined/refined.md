The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins.  The specific entry related to **CVE-2022-34813** is:

**CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in XPath Configuration Viewer Plugin**

**SECURITY-2658
/
CVE-2022-34812 (CSRF), CVE-2022-34813 (missing permission check)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The XPath Configuration Viewer Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints and does not require POST requests, leading to CSRF.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Missing permission check:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can create and delete XPath expressions.
    *   **CSRF:** The HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   An attacker can create and delete XPath expressions, potentially manipulating the plugin's behavior and accessing job configuration XML data.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   An attacker exploits the missing permission check by directly accessing the vulnerable endpoints.
    *   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link, which would trigger actions on the affected endpoints.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins to exploit the missing permission check. For the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with a crafted link.

**Additional notes**:
* The vulnerability is present in XPath Configuration Viewer Plugin versions 1.1.1 and earlier.
* There is no fix available for this plugin as of the publication date of the advisory.
* The advisory groups two related vulnerabilities under the same SECURITY identifier: SECURITY-2658. CVE-2022-34812 specifically covers the CSRF aspect, while CVE-2022-34813 covers the missing permission check.
