# Arbitrary path traversal (GHSL-2024-183)

High

[owen2345](/owen2345)

GHSA-cp65-5m9r-vc2c
Sep 18, 2024

## Package

bundler

2.8.0
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.8.2

## Description

A path traversal vulnerability accessible via MediaController's download\_private\_file method allows authenticated users to download any file on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the file permissions).

In the [download\_private\_file](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L28) method:

```
def download_private_file
  cama_uploader.enable_private_mode!

  file = cama_uploader.fetch_file("private/#{params[:file]}")

  send_file file, disposition: 'inline'
end
```

The file parameter is passed to the [fetch\_file](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/uploaders/camaleon_cms_local_uploader.rb#L27) method of the CamaleonCmsLocalUploader class (when files are uploaded locally):

```
def fetch_file(file_name)
  raise ActionController::RoutingError, 'File not found' unless file_exists?(file_name)

  file_name
end
```

If the file exists it's passed back to the download\_private\_file method where the file is sent to the user via [send\_file](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L33-L34).

Proof of concept

An authenticated user can download the /etc/passwd file by visiting an URL such as:

https:///admin/media/download\_private\_file?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd

Impact

This issue may lead to Information Disclosure.

Remediation

Normalize file paths constructed from untrusted user input before using them and check that the resulting path is inside the targeted directory. Additionally, do not allow character sequences such as .. in untrusted input that is used to build paths.
