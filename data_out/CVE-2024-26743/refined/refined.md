{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The issue is due to a missing cleanup step in the error handling of the `qedr_create_user_qp` function within the RDMA/qedr driver. When `qedr_init_user_queue()` fails, allocated resources like the umem and pbl_tbl are not being freed leading to a resource leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource leak due to improper error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Resource leak, potentially leading to a denial of service if enough resources are leaked. The error manifests as a warning related to `uverbs_destroy_ufile_hw` during cleanup, indicating an attempt to free an already freed resource.",
     "attack_vectors": "A user-space application could trigger the error condition within `qedr_init_user_queue` causing the resource leak.",
    "required_capabilities": "A user-space application capable of interacting with the RDMA subsystem and triggering the code path in `qedr_create_user_qp` that leads to the failure of `qedr_init_user_queue`."
  },
  "fix": {
      "description": "The fix introduces a cleanup mechanism within the error path of `qedr_create_user_qp`. When `qedr_init_user_queue` fails, the allocated `umem` resource is released using `ib_umem_release`, and the associated `pbl_tbl` is freed by using `qedr_free_pbl` for ROCE or `kfree` otherwise.",
       "code_changes": "The patch adds an `if (rc)` block that contains the resource cleanup before returning from the function, which previously did not perform any cleanup in the event of an error in qedr_init_user_queue()."
