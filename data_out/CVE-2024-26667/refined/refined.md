Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-26667.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check for a valid `hw_pp` pointer in the `dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup` function within the Linux kernel's Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem, specifically in the `drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/dpu1/dpu_encoder.c` file. The code was assuming that `hw_pp` will always be valid, which is not always the case. This could lead to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code directly accesses the `merge_3d` member of `hw_pp` without verifying if `hw_pp` is a valid pointer. If `hw_pp` is null, this leads to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash: A null pointer dereference will likely cause the system to crash, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the cleanup phase of the DPU encoder. The exact steps to trigger the scenario where `hw_pp` is NULL are not described in the provided text, but it involves the DRM subsystem and DPU encoder within the kernel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the DRM subsystem and the DPU encoder in a way that leads to the null `hw_pp` condition during the cleanup. This typically requires a certain level of access to the device (e.g., through a privileged user or through a driver-related vulnerability). The provided information does not specify the needed access level.
