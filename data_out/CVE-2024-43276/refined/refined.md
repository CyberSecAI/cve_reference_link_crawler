- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Child Theme Creator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts will execute when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts via user input within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The vulnerability is unauthenticated meaning an attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to exploit it.
