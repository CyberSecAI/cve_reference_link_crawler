{
  "CVE-2017-3312": {
    "Root cause": "Insecure handling of the error log file creation by the `mysqld_safe` script.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The `mysqld_safe` script, which is used to start the MariaDB/MySQL server, does not properly handle the creation of the error log file.",
       "This allows the mysql user to create or manipulate the log file in such a way that it can escalate privileges to root."
    ],
    "Impact": "Privilege escalation to root by a local mysql operating system user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation through the `mysqld_safe` script."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local operating system user with mysql privileges."
  }
}
