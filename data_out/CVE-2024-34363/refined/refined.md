- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The nlohmann JSON library, when invoked by Envoy, could throw an uncaught exception when serializing incomplete UTF-8 strings. This exception leads to a crash. Specifically, the `sort_properties` option within Envoy's JSON access logging triggers the issue when processing untrusted user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncaught exception due to incomplete UTF-8 string serialization in nlohmann JSON library.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Envoy crashes.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an HTTP request with an incomplete UTF-8 sequence (e.g., `\xec`) in a header that is logged (e.g. `X-Forwarded-For`). The access log must use JSON formatting with `sort_properties: true`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to Envoy and needs to know the configuration of the Envoy instance to exploit the vulnerability.
