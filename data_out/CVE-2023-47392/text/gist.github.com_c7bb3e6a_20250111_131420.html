|  | Vulnerability description: Mercedes me IOS APP has the vulnerability of increasing shopping cart orders and querying shopping cart contents beyond its authority. |
| --- | --- |
|  | An attacker can bypass the APP's authentication mechanism by constructing a specific request to add shopping cart orders and query the contents of the cart as another user. |
|  | Since these operations are often subject to strict authentication, such overreach can lead to serious security issues. |
|  | In addition, since the shopping cart may contain the user's personal information and sensitive data, such an unauthorized query may lead to the disclosure of the user's privacy. |
|  | At the same time, the attacker can also obtain the user's shopping habits and preferences in this way, and further conduct targeted fraud activities. |
|  |  |
|  | --------------------------------------------------- |
|  | Affected version: APP version <=1.34.0 |
|  |  |
|  | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  | Test tool: iPhone 13 Pro-ios 16.6.1+Burp Suite |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  | Vulnerability verification |
|  | We can Query the user who just added the cart by changing our default VIN to the Query vulnerability URL |
|  |  |
|  | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  | Add: You can view the number of items in your cart without permission |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | Change the VIN in the request package |
