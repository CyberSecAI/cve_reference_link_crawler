Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-36305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Trend Micro Apex One NT RealTime Scan service.
- It stems from the service's improper handling of directory junctions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The service is susceptible to arbitrary file creation through the abuse of directory junctions.
- The service does not properly validate the target location of created files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM.
- Attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the SYSTEM user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is local and requires the attacker to first gain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The attacker creates a directory junction to manipulate the behavior of the vulnerable service.
- The service then creates files in attacker-controlled locations, leading to privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-privileged code execution capabilities on the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create directory junctions.

**Additional Information:**
- Trend Micro has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Trend Micro on 2024-01-03.
