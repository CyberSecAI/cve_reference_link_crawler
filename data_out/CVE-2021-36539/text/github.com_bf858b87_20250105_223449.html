| Disclaimer This is an active exploit and it might be actively utilized. I don't know if this is a proper place to file for it but I find no better place elsewhere after my email got no response in 1 month. I choose to publish it here during the summer break to minimizing the potential impact.  I would suggest publishing a `Security Advisories` to raise awareness if see fit. Summary: `canvadoc_session_url` could be exploited for unrestricted access to unpublished content. Steps to reproduce:  1. Get API access to Canvas as a student to a specific course. 2. [Optional] Bruteforce finding file ID for a specific course ID. For example: `https://canvas.myschool.edu/api/v1/courses/$CourseID/files/$FileID`    * This step could be optimized with knowledge of the approximate file ID range and/or the keyword in the filename. 3. Access `canvadoc_session_url` in the JSON object returned by the API.  Expected behavior: The `canvadoc_session_url` should deny access for whoever logged in Canvas as a student if the file is not published. Actual behavior: Access to locked/unpublished files is granted to students via `canvadoc_session_url`. The student will be redirected to a DocViewer under `https://canvadocs.instructure.com/` Additional notes: This exploited might already be fixed in a new version. But please understand different institutions might not be using the same up-to-date version of Canvas as I clearly see different access verification levels from different institutions. If that is the case, please kindly notify users to update to a minimal version with a feasible fix.  Otherwise, proper permission checking for `/api/v1/canvadoc_session` should be easy to implement and enforce.  Credits go to [@yl4579](https://github.com/yl4579) for realizing this potential exploit in a tea-time discussion with me. |
