Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-34073:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `os.system()` in the `capture_dependencies` function within the `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils` module. This function constructs a command using the `requirements_path` parameter which is then executed directly by the system shell.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** By passing a malicious value to the `requirements_path` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands into the command string.
- The use of `os.system()` without proper sanitization of the input allows execution of arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation could allow an unprivileged third party to execute arbitrary code on the host system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious commands could lead to the system crashing or becoming unresponsive.
- **Compromise of Confidentiality and Integrity:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive data, modify existing data, and compromise the system's integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- The vulnerability is triggered by passing an unsafe string to the `requirements_path` parameter within the `capture_dependencies` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to control or influence the `requirements_path` parameter being passed to the vulnerable function. User interaction is required for the attack to occur, specifically the user providing the malicious path.
- No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of `sagemaker-python-sdk` prior to 2.214.3.
- The fix involves replacing `os.system()` with `subprocess.run()`, which is a safer way to execute external commands.  The `subprocess.run()` function, when used with `check=True` will raise an exception when a command exits with a non-zero exit code, and it prevents shell injection. The fix also uses the list format of command arguments, which is recommended over passing a string to the shell.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was found through coordinated vulnerability disclosure with HiddenLayer.
- The CVSS score is 7.8 which indicates a high severity vulnerability.
- The commit `2d873d53f708ea570fc2e2a6974f8c3097fe9df5` fixes the vulnerability by replacing `os.system()` with `subprocess.run()`.
- The pull request #4556 includes the change replacing `os.system(command)` with `subprocess.run(command, check=True, capture_output=True)`.
