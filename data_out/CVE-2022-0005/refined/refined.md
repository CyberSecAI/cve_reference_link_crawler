The content is related to CVE-2022-0005.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to sensitive information being accessible through physical probing of the JTAG interface on certain Intel processors with SGX.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Physical access to the JTAG interface allows for potential information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user with physical access can potentially enable information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the JTAG interface of the affected Intel processors is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the device with the vulnerable Intel processor.
- The attacker also needs to be able to perform physical probing of the JTAG interface.
