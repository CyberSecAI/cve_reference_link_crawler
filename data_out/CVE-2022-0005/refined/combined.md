### Recommendations:

Intel recommends that users of affected Intel® Processors update to the latest version firmware provided by the system manufacturer that addresses these issues.

Intel has released microcode updates for the affected Intel® Processors that are currently supported on the public github repository. Please see details below on access to the microcode:

GitHub\*: Public Github: <https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files>

This CVE requires a Microcode Security Version Number (SVN) update. To address this issue, an Intel SGX TCB Recovery is planned. Details can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/resources/q4-2022-intel-sgx-tcb-recovery-guidance.html).

Refer to [Intel SGX Attestation Technical Details](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/technical-details/sgx-attestation-technical-details.html) for more information on the Intel SGX TCB recovery process.

Further [TCB Recovery Guidance](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-software-guard-extensions-trusted-computing-base-tcb-recovery.html) for developers is available.

### Acknowledgements:

The following issue was found internally by Intel employees. Intel would like to thank Ilya Alexandrovich for reporting this issue.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
