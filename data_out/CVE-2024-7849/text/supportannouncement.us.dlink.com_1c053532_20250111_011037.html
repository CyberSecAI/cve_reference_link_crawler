Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link US is prohibited to provide support for these EOL/EOS products, if your are outside the US, please contact your regional D-Link office. If your device was provided by licensed carrier (service provider) and firmware please contact your carrier (service provider). May devices on this list have available 3rd party open-firmware, D-Link does not support open-firmware which voids any warranty and is solely the responsibility of the device's owner.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. **If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation,** please make sure the device has the last know firmware which can be located on the Legacy Website links above. Please make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
