### @Lee-W **[Lee-W](/Lee-W)** commented [Jun 29, 2023](#issue-1780875329)

## What's the issue

In airflow/airflow/api\_connexion/endpoints/config\_endpoint.py, `conf.getboolean("webserver", "expose_config")` only handle the boolean cases without handling "non-sensitive-only" which is a valid value according to [doc](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.2/configurations-ref.html#expose-config)

[airflow/airflow/api\_connexion/endpoints/config\_endpoint.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/f2e2125b070794b6a66fb3e2840ca14d07054cf2/airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/config_endpoint.py#L79)

[f2e2125](/apache/airflow/commit/f2e2125b070794b6a66fb3e2840ca14d07054cf2)

|  | elif conf.getboolean("webserver", "expose\_config"): |
| --- | --- |

,

[airflow/airflow/api\_connexion/endpoints/config\_endpoint.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/f2e2125b070794b6a66fb3e2840ca14d07054cf2/airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/config_endpoint.py#L108)

Line 108
in
[f2e2125](/apache/airflow/commit/f2e2125b070794b6a66fb3e2840ca14d07054cf2)

|  | elif conf.getboolean("webserver", "expose\_config"): |
| --- | --- |

## How to reproduce

1. add the following value to `files/airflow-breeze-config/variables.env`

```
AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__EXPOSE_CONFIG=NON-SENSITIVE-ONLY
AIRFLOW__API__AUTH_BACKENDS=airflow.api.auth.backend.default

```

2. `breeze --python 3.9 --backend sqlite start-airflow`
3. log in through Airflow UI
4. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:28080/api/v1/config` and `http://127.0.0.1:28080/api/v1/config/section/database/option/sql_alchemy_conn`. both of them fail

## What's changed

"non-sensitive-only" is handled in the code section mentioned in **## What's the issue**. Sensitive data will be replace as `< hidden >` like how it's implemented elsewhere

Nce. Seems it was only implemented for the "/configuration" endpoint.

Subject: CVE-2024-31869: Apache Airflow: Sensitive configuration for providers displayed when "non-sensitive-only" config used

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow 2.7.0 through 2.8.4

Description:

Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4 have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to see sensitive provider configuration via the "configuration" UI page when "non-sensitive-only" was set as "webserver.expose_config" configuration (The celery provider is the only community provider currently that has sensitive configurations). You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or change your "expose_config" configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different to  CVE-2023-46288 <https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq>  which concerned API, not UI configuration page.
