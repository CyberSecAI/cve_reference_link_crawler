{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `conf.getboolean(\"webserver\", \"expose_config\")` method in `airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/config_endpoint.py` only handled boolean values (`True` or `False`) and did not account for the string value `non-sensitive-only`, which is a valid configuration for `webserver.expose_config` according to the documentation. This resulted in the configuration API failing when `webserver.expose_config` was set to `non-sensitive-only`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of configuration values",
       "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The configuration API would fail when `webserver.expose_config` was set to `non-sensitive-only` instead of a boolean value, preventing users from retrieving configuration information.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with access to the Airflow configuration API could cause the API calls to fail by setting the configuration to 'non-sensitive-only'. This does not expose sensitive information, but causes the API to fail.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to set the `webserver.expose_config` to a value other than a boolean and then invoke the API."
  },
  "other_details": {
    "related_cve": "The content mentions CVE-2024-31869 which is a similar issue but affects the UI rather than API",
    "additional_notes": "The fix implemented addresses the issue by correctly handling the `non-sensitive-only` value, ensuring that sensitive data is masked in the API response, as intended."
