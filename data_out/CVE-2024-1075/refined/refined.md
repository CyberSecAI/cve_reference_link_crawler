Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1075

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin improperly validates the request path when determining whether to display the maintenance mode page. Specifically, it was using `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` directly in a string comparison, which can be manipulated to bypass the maintenance mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The plugin failed to properly sanitize or parse the request URI, making it susceptible to manipulation. Specifically, `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` was used without sanitization.
- **Authorization Bypass:** By manipulating the request URI, an unauthenticated attacker could bypass the maintenance mode and access pages that should be hidden.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could view content that was intended to be hidden behind the maintenance page, including potentially sensitive information or incomplete site content.
- **Bypass Maintenance Mode:** The plugin's intended functionality of displaying a maintenance page to all users is bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a specific HTTP request by manipulating the `REQUEST_URI` that bypasses the plugin's maintenance mode logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special permissions on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code was located in `minimal-coming-soon-maintenance-mode/trunk/framework/public/init.php`, specifically around line 67.
- The original code used `strpos` to check for the presence of specific paths in `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` to determine whether to show the maintenance mode page.
- The fix involved using `parse_url` with `PHP_URL_PATH` to extract only the path portion of the URL and to use `sanitize_url` on both `HTTP_HOST` and `REQUEST_URI` before using the values. This prevents manipulation of the URI from bypassing the maintenance page.

**Affected Versions:**
- Minimal Coming Soon â€“ Coming Soon Page plugin versions <= 2.37.

**Patched Version:**
- Version 2.38 and later.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as a low severity with a CVSS score of 3.7.
- The bypass is related to how the plugin was using the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` variable, which is user-controlled.
