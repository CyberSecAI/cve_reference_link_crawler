The Minimal Coming Soon â€“ Coming Soon Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to maintenance mode bypass and information disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.37. This is due to the plugin improperly validating the request path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass maintenance mode and view pages that should be hidden.
