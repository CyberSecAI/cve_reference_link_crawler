| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2215930#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2023-06-19 12:39:55 UTC  ``` A heap out of bound read issue exists in builtin.c of gawk prior to version 5.1.1. The array "the_args" takes an unsafe index "val", while it does not validate the index to ensure the index refers to a valid position in the array (e.g., exceedingly large or negative). The vulnerability can cause crash of the software and might be used by attackers to read sensitive information.  <https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gawk/2022-08/msg00000.html> <https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gawk/2022-08/msg00023.html> <https://fossies.org/linux/gawk/ChangeLog#470> (Line: 470-475)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2215930#c3)  TEJ RATHI    2023-06-19 12:52:24 UTC  ``` Created gawk tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2215940](show_bug.cgi?id=2215940 "CLOSED EOL - TRIAGE gawk: heap out of bound read in builtin.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2215930#c8)  Dale Lindsey    2024-04-02 03:11:08 UTC  ``` I've observed that systemd is used in userspace by one of the tools we use that says it supports Red Hat. Which viewpoint does the government espouse?  Systemd user service error: <https://help.tableau.com/current/server-linux/en-us.html> <https://slice-master.io> The systemd user service is utilized, although not as often as the normal systemd process manager. Red Hat deactivated the systemd user service in RHEL 7 (and so all RHEL-derived distributions, such as CentOS, Oracle Linux 7, and Amazon Linux 2). Nonetheless, RedHat has told Tableau that utilizing the systemd user service is OK as long as the service is reactivated."    Please refer to my remark at <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3461241> on their method.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2215930#c9)  Paul    2024-10-02 03:54:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to TEJ RATHI from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=2215930#c0)) > A heap out of bound read issue exists in builtin.c of gawk prior to version > 5.1.1.

This lack of index checking can lead to crashes and potentially allow attackers to read sensitive information from memory. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to update to version 5.1.1 or later, where this issue has likely been addressed. Additionally, implementing rigorous input validation and bounds checking in the code can help prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2215930#c10)  helen dam    2024-12-06 02:18:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dale Lindsey from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=2215930#c8)) > I've observed that systemd is used in userspace by one of the tools we use > that says it supports Red Hat.
