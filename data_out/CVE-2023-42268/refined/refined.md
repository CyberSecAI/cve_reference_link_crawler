The provided content relates to CVE-2023-42268.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/show` interface in jeecgboot version 3.5.3 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization and blacklisting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/show` endpoint.
- The application employs a blacklist-based approach to prevent SQL injection, which is inadequate and can be bypassed using boolean blind SQL injection techniques.
- The blacklist includes keywords like `exec`, `performance_schema`, `information_schema`, `extractvalue`, `updatexml`, `geohash`, `gtid_subset`, `gtid_subtract`, `insert`, `alter`, `delete`, `grant`, `update`, `drop`, `chr`, `mid`, `master`, `truncate`, `char`, `declare` and `user()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. This is achieved through blind boolean based techniques that bypass the blacklist implemented.
- The lack of authentication makes the system vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can send malicious requests to the vulnerable `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/show` endpoint.
- By crafting specific SQL payloads that bypass the blacklist, attackers can perform SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the application to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
