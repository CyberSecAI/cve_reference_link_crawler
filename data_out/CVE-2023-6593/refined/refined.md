- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Client-side permission bypass in Remote Desktop Manager iOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly restrict access to entries within a SQL data source.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the application can execute entries in a SQL data source without restriction.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must have access to the iOS device where the vulnerable application is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the application on the iOS device.
