Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-2076:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2021-2076, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the "Server: Optimizer" component of MySQL. The specific nature of the flaw isn't described, but it is related to how the optimizer handles queries.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The vulnerability is present in the MySQL server's optimizer.
- The specific weakness appears to be related to an error in processing queries, possibly leading to an exploitable condition.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can cause a denial of service, which could be partial or complete, due to a hang or repeatable crash of the MySQL server.
- **Unauthorized Data Access:**  While not the primary impact, successful exploitation may lead to unauthorized modification of MySQL server-accessible data, which may also include a read.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network through the MySQL protocol.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable MySQL server.
- **Privilege Level:** An attacker requires high privileges on the MySQL server to exploit this vulnerability, although there are other MySQL vulnerabilities that require low privileges.
- **Specific Knowledge:**  The attacker would likely need specific knowledge of the vulnerable component and how to trigger the flaw, although this information is generally available once the vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information comes from a Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA) and NetApp Security Advisory. Both of these sources point to the fact that a patch is required for a given product if they integrate vulnerable versions of MySQL.
- The Oracle advisory also lists the CVE as being part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in their January 2021 Critical Patch Update.
- The CVSS score is consistent across the NetApp and Oracle documentation at 4.9.
- The NetApp advisory lists several NetApp products that are impacted and the corresponding fix version.
- The Gentoo advisory states that an attacker could escalate privileges, gain access to critical data or complete access to all MySQL server accessible data, or cause a Denial of Service condition, which is more severe than the vulnerability description in the Oracle and NetApp documentation.

This analysis provides a summary of the key aspects of CVE-2021-2076 based on the provided context.
