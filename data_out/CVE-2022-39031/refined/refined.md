- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization in the Smart eVision task function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks when accessing the task function. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain session IDs of other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can obtain session IDs of other users. This could potentially allow for unauthorized access and further malicious actions depending on what the session ID allows.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed remotely, requiring no prior authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Smart eVision application to exploit the vulnerability. They do not need to be an authorized user on the system.
