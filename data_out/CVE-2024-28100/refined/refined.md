- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially crafted file uploaded by a regular user can cause arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed in the browser of a visitor when viewing a list of experiments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the eLabFTW application, acting on behalf of the visitor. This includes actions like creating API keys for persistence or other options normally available to the user. If the visitor has sysadmin privileges, the attacker can gain full control including system configuration and user management.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker uploads a malicious file. A user then views a list of experiments where the malicious code is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a regular user account to upload the malicious file. Requires a user to view the infected list of experiments, and for the attacker to have crafted the file with malicious JS.
