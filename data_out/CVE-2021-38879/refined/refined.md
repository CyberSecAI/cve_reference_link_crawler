- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jazz Team Server sets the `JSA_CSRF` cookie without the `HttpOnly` flag.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of `HttpOnly` flag on the `JSA_CSRF` cookie, which allows scripts to access the cookie.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute scripts to access the `JSA_CSRF` cookie and transmit it to another site. This could potentially lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious scripts can be executed within the context of a user's session to access the cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute malicious scripts within the context of a user's session on the Jazz Team Server. This could be achieved through various means, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
