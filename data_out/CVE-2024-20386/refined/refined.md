- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker could insert crafted input into various data fields in an affected interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send crafted input to the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco FMC software. No authentication is required.
