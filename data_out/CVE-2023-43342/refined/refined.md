Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user input within the "Pages" field in the "Languages" menu of Quick CMS v6.7. Specifically, the application does not adequately filter or encode user-supplied data before displaying it in the web page, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This means the malicious script is stored within the application's database or file system and is executed when a user accesses the affected page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize user-provided input in the "Pages" field of the "Languages" settings. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject and store malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the context of a user's browser session. This could enable a wide range of malicious activities such as:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate users.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data and sending it to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites to infect them with malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the website.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Displaying fake login forms or other content to trick users into divulging their credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the web interface of the Quick CMS admin panel.
*   **Specific Input Field:** The vulnerability is triggered by entering a malicious script into the "Pages" field under "Languages - Front and back end" section within the administrative panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have access to the Quick CMS admin panel with the necessary permissions to modify the "Languages" settings.
*   **Local Attacker:** The description mentions "local attacker," implying that an attacker with access to the administrative interface can exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Affected Software:** Quick CMS v6.7
*   **Vulnerable Section:** The "Languages - Front and back end" section's "Pages" field.
*   **XSS Payload:** The provided example payload is: `'"><svg/onload=alert('Pages')>`. This payload utilizes an SVG tag with an onload event handler to execute a JavaScript alert.

In summary, this is a stored XSS vulnerability in Quick CMS v6.7 that can be exploited by a local authenticated user through the languages menu to inject malicious javascript into the pages settings, which will be executed when other users access the affected page.
