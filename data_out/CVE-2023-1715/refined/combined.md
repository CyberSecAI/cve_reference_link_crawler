## Vulnerability Details:[#](#vulnerability-details)

This report presents information on a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Bitrix24’s Invoice Edit page that allows an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript code on the browser of any victim that visits the affected page. If the victim has administrator permissions, an attacker may leverage the built-in “PHP Command Line” feature to execute arbitrary system commands on the target web server.

Authorized users may edit an invoice they have access to via the `crm.invoice.edit` component, located at `bitrix/components/bitrix/crm.invoice.edit/component.php` and accessible via a post request to `https://TARGET_HOST/bitrix/urlrewrite.php?SEF_APPLICATION_CUR_PAGE_URL=/crm/invoice/edit/INVOICE_ID/`.

One of the fields that can be supplied by an attacker is the `USER_DESCRIPTION` field. As this field is rendered as HTML by a rich text editor in the frontend, sanitization is performed on this field to prevent XSS:

```
// bitrix/components/bitrix/crm.invoice.edit/component.php lines 746 to 763
$userDescription = trim($_POST['USER_DESCRIPTION']);
$bSanitizeUserDescription = ($userDescription !== '' && mb_strpos($userDescription, '<')); // [1]
if($bSanitizeComments || $bSanitizeUserDescription)
{
    $sanitizer = new CBXSanitizer();
    $sanitizer->ApplyDoubleEncode(false);
    $sanitizer->SetLevel(CBXSanitizer::SECURE_LEVEL_MIDDLE);
    //Crutch for for Chrome line break behaviour in HTML editor.
    $sanitizer->AddTags(array('div' => array()));
    $sanitizer->AddTags(array('a' => array('href', 'title', 'name', 'style', 'alt', 'target')));
    $sanitizer->AddTags(array('p' => array()));
    $sanitizer->AddTags(array('span' => array('style')));
    if ($bSanitizeComments)
        $comments = $sanitizer->SanitizeHtml($comments);
    if ($bSanitizeUserDescription)
        $userDescription = $sanitizer->SanitizeHtml($userDescription);
    unset($sanitizer);
}

```

The `mb_strpos($userDescription, '<')` check (`[1]`) is supposed to check if the user description contains the `<` character, which could indicate that this field contains HTML tags and thus requires sanitization. However, if the `<` character is the first character, `mb_strpos($userDescription, '<')` would be 0, resulting in `$bSanitizeUserDescription` being false. Thus, sanitization of this field can be completely bypassed.

The `$userDescription` field is subsequently saved to the database, along with the rest of the invoice data.

However, the built-in Bitrix XSS sanitizer, applied to the body parameters of every request, complicates exploitation of this vulnerability.

The XSS sanitizer uses several regular expressions (regex) to identify and sanitize potentially dangerous input. One of these aims to target HTML event handlers, which could lead to XSS. The regex used can be found in `bitrix/modules/security/lib/filter/auditor/xss.php` on line 173, and a simplified version is shown below:

```
/(on[a-z]*)([a-z]{3}[\s]*=)/is

```

The regex aims to identify patterns such as `onerror=` and uses two capturing groups to split the dangerous string into two parts. A space is then added between the two parts, neutralizing the event handler. For example, `onerror=` would be transformed into `oner ror=`. Note that the regex allows any amount of whitespace between the event handler name (eg `onerror`) and the equals sign (`=`). This is compliant with the HTML specification. On its own, this sanitizer is secure.

When an authorized user navigates to the invoice edit page, the stored invoice is retrieved. The user description field is then passed to the `CLightHTMLEditor` class as the content to be edited.

The configuration for this editor, including the content, is injected into the JavaScript context after sanitization by the `CUtil::PhpToJSObject` function.

```
<script>
// ...
// bitrix/modules/fileman/classes/general/light_editor.php line 254
top.<?=$this->jsObjName?> = window.<?=$this->jsObjName?> = new window.JCLightHTMLEditor(<?=CUtil::PhpToJSObject($this->JSConfig)?>);
// ...
</script>

```

The `CUtil::PhpToJSObject` function calls the `CUtil::JSEscape` function (shown below) on the value of each key-value pair in the `$this->JSConfig` array.

```
// bitrix/modules/main/tools.php lines 4349 to 4355
public static function JSEscape($s){
    static $aSearch = array("\xe2\x80\xa9", "\\", "'", "\"", "\r\n", "\r", "\n", "\xe2\x80\xa8", "*/", "</");
    static $aReplace = array(" ", "\\\\", "\\'", '\\"', "\n", "\n", "\\n", "\\n", "*\\/", "<\\/");
    $val = str_replace($aSearch, $aReplace, $s);
    return $val;
}

```

This function performs a simple string replacement on the input string `$s` to ensure that it does not contain any characters that may break out of a JavaScript string, such as `"`, `'` or `\`.

Notably, this function replaces the byte string `\xe2\x80\xa9` ([U+2029 Unicode Paragraph Separator](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U%2B2029)) with a regular space ([U+0020 Space](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U%2B0020)).

This is a significant transformation as the Bitrix XSS sanitizer does not regard the byte string `\xe2\x80\xa9` as whitespace. Therefore, the string `onerror\xe2\x80\xa9=` would not be sanitized. However, `CUtil::JSEscape` would transform the string into `onerror =`, which is a valid HTML `onerror` event handler.

After sanitization and transformation by `CUtil::JSEscape`, the constructor of the JavaScript class `JCLightHTMLEditor` injects the content to be edited into HTML:

```
// bitrix/js/fileman/light_editor/le_core.js lines 616 to 618
this.pEditorDocument.open();
this.pEditorDocument.write('<html><head></head><body>' + sContent + '</body></html>');
this.pEditorDocument.close();

```

Therefore, a malicious attacker may create an invoice with user description `<img src=x onerror\xe2\x80\xa9=alert(document.domain)>`. As `<` is the first character in the string, sanitization in `bitrix/components/bitrix/crm.invoice.edit/component.php` is bypassed. Additionally, as `onerror\xe2\x80\xa9=` does not match the regex for an event handler, the built-in XSS sanitizer does not sanitize this string. Finally `CUtil::JSEscape` replaces `\xe2\x80\xa9` with , resulting in `<img src=x onerror =alert(document.domain)>`. This string is then injected into HTML, resulting in XSS.

## Proof-of-Concept:[#](#proof-of-concept)

We have tried our best to make the PoC as portable as possible. This report includes a functional exploit written in Python3 that edits an existing invoice to inject malicious HTML in the user description field.

A sample exploit script is shown below:

```
## Exploit Conditions:[#](#exploit-conditions)

This vulnerability can be exploited when the attacker has access to the CRM feature and permission to create and export contacts. This level of access may be granted if the user is in the management board group.

## Detection Guidance:[#](#detection-guidance)

It is possible to detect the exploitation of this vulnerability by examining traffic logs to detect the presence of the byte string `\xe2\x80\xa9` in request bodies. The presence of this string together with other characters like `<` and `=` indicate possible exploitation of this vulnerability.
