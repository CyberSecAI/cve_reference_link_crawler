Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-1715 (and CVE-2023-1716, which is related)

**Root Cause:**

*   **CVE-2023-1715:** A logic error in the sanitization process of the `USER_DESCRIPTION` field in the Bitrix24 invoice edit page. The `mb_strpos()` function is used to check for the presence of `<` character, which indicates HTML, but fails when `<` is the first character, preventing sanitization.
*   **CVE-2023-1716:** A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, caused by the failure to properly neutralize the user-supplied input in the `USER_DESCRIPTION` field, which is then rendered unsanitized within the context of a JavaScript object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Neutralization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `USER_DESCRIPTION` field when editing invoices. The initial check for HTML tags is flawed.
*  **Bypassing XSS Sanitization:** The application's built-in XSS sanitizer is bypassed due to the use of the byte string `\xe2\x80\xa9` which is not recognized as whitespace by the sanitizer.
*  **JavaScript Injection:** The content of the unsanitized `USER_DESCRIPTION` is injected into the Javascript context after being processed by `CUtil::JSEscape`, which transforms `\xe2\x80\xa9` to space, thereby creating a valid `onerror` event.
*  **Stored XSS:** The malicious payload is stored in the database and executed when a user views the invoice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** If the victim has administrator privileges, the attacker can potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leveraging the built-in PHP command line feature. This leads to full server compromise.
*   **Data theft, session hijacking, malicious activity:**  XSS could be used to steal cookies, manipulate content on the page, or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Specifically Crafted Input:** The attacker sends a specially crafted `USER_DESCRIPTION` field with a leading `<` character and a javascript event handler containing `\xe2\x80\xa9` (Unicode Paragraph Separator) to bypass sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs a user account with the ability to create and edit invoices in Bitrix24. This might be granted to users in the management board group.
*   **Access to Invoice Edit Page:** The attacker must have access to the invoice edit page.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs to craft a specific payload that leverages the identified bypass and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Victim interaction:** The victim must visit the edited invoice page for the exploit to trigger.
