Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-2456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `BIRemotingServlet` component of Oracle Business Intelligence. This improper validation leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is the application's failure to sanitize or validate data before deserializing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Oracle Business Intelligence installation.
- **Administrator Context:** The attacker can execute code within the context of the Administrator, granting them high privileges and the ability to perform a wide range of malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Oracle Business Intelligence server.
- **No Prior Knowledge:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials or other prior authorization to exploit the vulnerability. They can directly send malicious serialized data to the affected component.
