### @tuminoid **[tuminoid](/tuminoid)** commented [Sep 3, 2024](#issue-2501953747)

The BareMetalHost CRD allows the UserData, MetaData, and NetworkData for the provisioned host to be specified as links to k8s Secrets. There are fields for both the Name and Namespace of the Secret, meaning that the baremetal-operator will read a Secret from any namespace. If a Secret contains the key "value" (or "userData", "metaData", or "networkData"), its corresponding value can be exfiltrated by a user provisioning a Host pointing to that Secret, then retrieving that data from the provisioned host.
