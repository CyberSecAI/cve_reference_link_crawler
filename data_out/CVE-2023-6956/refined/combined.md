### Description

The EasyAzon – Amazon Associates Affiliate Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘easyazon-cloaking-locale’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

I’m amazed the new developers of this plug-in merged the pro features into the free version. Amazed, and very grateful. This is a truly excellent Amazon link building / searching / localisation generating / etc. plugin. Try it.

I have been using Amazon’s custom link through their Site Stripe but it has stopped working on all my sites. So glad I found EasyAzon. Love how easy it is to use. Thanks for updating it on a regular basis.
