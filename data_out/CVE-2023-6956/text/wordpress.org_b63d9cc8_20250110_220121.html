I’m amazed the new developers of this plug-in merged the pro features into the free version. Amazed, and very grateful. This is a truly excellent Amazon link building / searching / localisation generating / etc. plugin. Try it.

I have been using Amazon’s custom link through their Site Stripe but it has stopped working on all my sites. So glad I found EasyAzon. Love how easy it is to use. Thanks for updating it on a regular basis.
