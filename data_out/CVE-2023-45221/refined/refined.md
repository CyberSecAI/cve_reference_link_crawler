Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-45221:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper buffer restrictions in Intel® Media SDK software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient checks on buffer sizes or boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can potentially achieve local escalation of privilege. This means an attacker who already has some level of access to the system can use this vulnerability to gain higher privileges.

**Attack vectors:** Local access. The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with local access to the system. The user also needs to perform a user-initiated action (UI:R).

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected software is Intel® Media SDK software, all versions.
*   The CVSS v3.1 score is 4.8 (Medium).
*   The CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L, indicating:
    *   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *  **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
    *   **UI:R** (User Interaction: Required)
    *   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   **C:L** (Confidentiality Impact: Low)
    *   **I:L** (Integrity Impact: Low)
    *   **A:L** (Availability Impact: Low)
