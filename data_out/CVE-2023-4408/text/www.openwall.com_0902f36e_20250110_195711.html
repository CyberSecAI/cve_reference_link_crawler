Subject: ISC has disclosed six vulnerabilities in BIND 9 (CVE-2023-4408,
 CVE-2023-5517, CVE-2023-5679, CVE-2023-6516, CVE-2023-50387, CVE-2023-50868)

On 13 February 2024 we (Internet Systems Consortium) disclosed six vulnerabilities affecting our BIND 9 software:

- CVE-2023-4408:        Parsing large DNS messages may cause excessive CPU load <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-4408>
- CVE-2023-5517:        Querying RFC 1918 reverse zones may cause an assertion failure when "nxdomain-redirect" is enabled <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-5517>
- CVE-2023-5679:        Enabling both DNS64 and serve-stale may cause an assertion failure during recursive resolution <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-5679>
- CVE-2023-6516:        Specific recursive query patterns may lead to an out-of-memory condition <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-6516>
- CVE-2023-50387:       KeyTrap - Extreme CPU consumption in DNSSEC validator <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-50387>
- CVE-2023-50868:       Preparing an NSEC3 closest encloser proof can exhaust CPU resources <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-50868>

New versions of BIND 9 are available from <https://www.isc.org/downloads>

Operators and package maintainers who prefer to apply patches selectively can find individual vulnerability-specific patches in the "patches" subdirectory of each published release directory:

- <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.48/patches/>
- <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.24/patches/>
- <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.19.21/patches/>

With the public announcement of these vulnerabilities, the embargo period is ended and any updated software packages that have been prepared may be released.
