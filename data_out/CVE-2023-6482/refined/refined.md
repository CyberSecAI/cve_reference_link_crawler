- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The encryption keys used to secure the communication channel between the fingerprint sensor and the WBF device driver are derived from static host information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of static host information to derive encryption keys.
    - Vulnerable TLS handshake due to weak encryption.
    - Insecure command communication with fingerprint sensor.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Decryption of pairing data, allowing the attacker to establish a TLS session with the sensor.
    - Ability to send restricted commands to the fingerprint sensor.
    - Potential to enroll a fingerprint into the template database, especially when Windows Enhanced Sign-in Security is disabled.
    - Possible leakage of limited information from the sensor database.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Physical access to the fingerprint sensor.
    - Reverse engineering of the WBF device driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Physical access to the sensor and the device.
    - Ability to reverse-engineer software (WBF device driver).
    - Ability to create software to impersonate the driver and send commands to the sensor.
