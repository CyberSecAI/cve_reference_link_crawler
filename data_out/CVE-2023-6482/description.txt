Use of encryption key derived from static information in Synaptics Fingerprint Driver allows 

an attacker to set up a TLS session with the fingerprint sensor and send restricted commands to the fingerprint sensor.Â This may 
allow an attacker, who has physical access to the sensor, to enroll a fingerprint into the 
template database.
