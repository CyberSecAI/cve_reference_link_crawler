This plugin isn’t working as it’s supposed to and has all the very basic features for a payment gateway listed as PRO features. Do not recommend it.

Superb customer service. Very happy to work with them, they have fixed our payment issue. They also customized the plugin for us. Definitively recommended.

The team that developed and continues to work on this plugin is amazing. I had a problem and they helped me to resolve it rather quickly. I’ll be upgrading to the premium version very soon and will be recommending this option to several clients. Keep it up!

Terrible! 15 días pidiéndonos papeles y finalmente no aprobaron la cuenta.
Tenemos Paypal y Payonner y con ellos fue en 5 días y sin papeleo.
Ah! Y nunca nos dieron razón.
