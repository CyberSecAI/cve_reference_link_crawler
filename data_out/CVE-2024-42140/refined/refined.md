The provided content describes a fix for a deadlock vulnerability in the Linux kernel's kexec crash path on RISC-V architecture. This is achieved by removing a redundant call to `irq_set_irqchip_state()`.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `machine_kexec_mask_interrupts()` function, when called in an interrupt context, attempted to acquire the `irqdesc` spinlock and then deactivate the irqchip using `irq_set_irqchip_state()`. This resulted in a deadlock since the spinlock was already held in interrupt context.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code was attempting to deactivate the irqchip using `irq_set_irqchip_state()` even though on RISC-V, only the `irq_eoi` handler is required to complete EOI. This unnecessary call introduced a potential deadlock.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A deadlock would occur when the kexec crash code was called within an interrupt context, causing the system to hang.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the kexec crash path is executed in the interrupt context. The kexec crash path is triggered by user-space via `kexec_load`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to trigger a kernel crash (e.g. `panic()`) after initiating a kexec load in an environment where the kexec crash path is entered in the interrupt context to trigger a deadlock.

The patch removes the call to `irq_set_irqchip_state()` and instead uses only the `irq_eoi` handler to complete the EOI process in the `machine_kexec_mask_interrupts()` function for the RISC-V architecture.
