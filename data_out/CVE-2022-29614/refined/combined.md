## SAP Security Patch Day

The security maintenance of installed SAP software is key to continuously protect also against new types of attacks or newly identified potential weaknesses.

Based on feedback from customers, partners and SAP user groups, SAP has launched a regular **SAP Security Patch Day**, scheduled for the **second Tuesday of every month** — which has been synchronized with the Security Patch Day of other major software vendors.

On these SAP Patch Days, SAP publishes software corrections as **SAP Security Notes**, focused solely on security to protect against potential weaknesses or attacks. Access [SAP Security Notes in SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/app/securitynotes), then select *All Security Notes*, to get the complete list of all SAP Security Notes. **We recommend that you implement these corrections at a priority**. Several tools are available to help identify, select and implement these corrections.

SAP categorizes SAP Security Notes as *Patch Day Security Not*es and *Support Package Security Notes*, with the sole purpose of making you focus on important fixes on patch days and the rest to be implemented automatically during SP upgrades. For details refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html). Security fixes for SAP NetWeaver based products are also delivered with the support packages.

Starting June 11, 2019, for all new SAP Security Notes with high or very high severity we deliver fix for Support Packages shipped within the last 24 months\* for the versions under Mainstream Maintenance and Extended Maintenance. This is extended from the previous Support Package coverage of 18 months.

Notes with low or medium priority contain corrections in at least the newest support package in all mainstream and extended maintenance releases.

\*For information on areas with an exception from the 24 months maintenance strategy, refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html?anchorId=section_237298869 "exceptions").

Vendor description:
-------------------
"The SAP Start Service (sapstartsrv) provides basic management services for
systems and instances and single server processes. Services include starting
and stopping, monitoring the current run-time state, reading logs, traces and
configuration files, executing commands and retrieving other
technology-specific information, like network access points, active sessions,
thread list etc. They are exposed by a SOAP Web service interface named
"SAPControl". This paper describes how to use this Web service interface."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to implement the security note 3158619, where the
documented issue is fixed according to the vendor. We advise installing the
corrections as a matter of priority to keep business-critical data secured.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Local privilege escalation (CVE-2022-29614)
The SUID-root program sapuxuserchk erroneously follows the symbolic link to
create a temporary local logon ticket and change the ownership of the target
file for owner access only. As member of the group sapsys, a user can therefore
escalate his/her privileges to root on a local Unix system by successfully
exploiting a race condition.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Local privilege escalation (CVE-2022-29614)
The utility sapuxuserchk is used by sapcontrol to request a temporary local
logon ticket in the following way. As a result, the ticket is created in the
folder /usr/sap/SEC/D00/work/sapcontrol_logon/

$ sapcontrol -nr 0 -function RequestLogonFile user0

$ ls -l logon*
-rw------- 1 secadm sapsys 40 Feb 25 08:58 logon0
-rw------- 1 user0  users  40 Feb 25 09:00 logon1
-rw------- 1 root   root   40 Feb 25 09:01 logon2

Since sapcontrol is supposed to create the ticket for any system user, it
requires a utility with SUID bit set. The owner, group and its permission bits
of sapuxuserchk of a standard installation are shown below.

$ ls -l sapuxuserchk
-rwsr-x--- 1 root sapsys 1312137 Feb 28  2019 sapuxuserchk

The request originating from sapcontrol is first sent to the instance server
sapstartsrv, piping into sapuxuserchk a 512-byte encrypted message, which
contains the ticket path, user name and ticket in the plaintext, as an example
shown below.

$ strings input-0-plaintext
SAPLOGONFILE /usr/sap/SEC/D00/work/sapcontrol_logon/logon1
  user0
1133146902252676394602837452470900726967

On its duty to create the ticket, sapuxuserchk performs the sanity check to
guarantee the non-existence of the file prior to the creation in the
function internal_create_saplogon_file.

However, it introduces a race condition between the stat and open calls, as
shown by the following excerpt from strace.

stat("/usr/sap/SEC/D00/work/sapcontrol_logon/logon1", 0x7ffc0d2e1530) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/sap/SEC/D00/work/sapcontrol_logon/logon1", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0600) = 3
        fchown(3, 1000, 100)

The attacker can run a race of constantly creating a symbolic link logon1
pointing to a privileged file such as /etc/passwd and meanwhile invoke the
SUID-root program sapuxuserchk, in the hope that the creation of the link
take place between the stat and open calls, so that the first will fail,
(meaning that the file does not exist yet) while the second as well as the
ensuing fchown call succeeds. In a positive result, the attacker gains the
read-write permission of the target file.

The following run to winning the race took 629 attempts to finally gain the
root privilege. The PoC further below lists the exploit implementing the idea
above with a pre-intercepted message for user secadm.
