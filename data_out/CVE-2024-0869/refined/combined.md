There was an error accessing the WP REST API.Instant Images requires access to the WP REST API via <u>POST</u> request to fetch and upload images to your media library.

### Description

The Instant Images – One Click Image Uploads from Unsplash, Openverse, Pixabay and Pexels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary options update due to an insufficient check that neglects to verify whether the updated option belongs to the plugin on the instant-images/license REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.0. This makes it possible for authors and higher to update arbitrary options. CVE-2024-33569 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.
