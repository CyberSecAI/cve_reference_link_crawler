### @eed3si9n **[eed3si9n](/eed3si9n)** commented [Oct 22, 2023](#issue-1955818183) • edited Loading

Fixes [#358](https://github.com/sbt/io/issues/358)

Ref [codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver#87](https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/pull/87)

**Problem**

IO.unzip currently has zip-slip vulnerability, which can write arbitrary files on the machine using specially crafted zip archive that holds path traversal file names.

**Solution**

This replicates the fix originally sent to plex-archiver by Snyk Team.

Sorry, something went wrong.
