## Description

### Impact

Given specially crafted zip or JAR file, `IO.unzip` allows writing of arbitrary file. The follow is an example of a malicious entry:

```
+2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

This would have a potential to overwrite `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Within sbt's main code, `IO.unzip` is used in `pullRemoteCache` task and `Resolvers.remote`; however many projects use `IO.unzip(...)` directly to implement custom tasks - <https://github.com/search?q=IO.unzip+language%3AScala&type=code&l=Scala&p=1>

### Patches

The problem has been patched in [sbt/io#360](https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/360)

sbt 1.9.7 is available with the fix.

### Workarounds

A workaround might be use some other library to unzip.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
