Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `Calculator` function in `python/composio/tools/local/mathematical/actions/calculator.py` of composiohq composio versions up to 0.5.6 does not properly sanitize user input. It passes unsanitized user-controlled input to the `eval` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Code Injection (CWE-94): The application constructs code using external input without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are all affected. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system, stealing data, modifying files, or causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  By manipulating the input provided to the `Calculator` function, an attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed by the `eval` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable `Calculator` function. No specific privileges or positions are explicitly mentioned, meaning it could be exploitable if the Calculator is accessible to an untrusted user.
- The exploit is considered easy.
- A public exploit is available.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in composiohq composio versions up to 0.5.6.
- The vendor was contacted but did not respond.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available at the provided Notion link.
- MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059 is associated with this issue.
