Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The plugin fails to properly sanitize SVG file uploads, allowing malicious code to be embedded within the file.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated attacker with at least Author-level access or higher in WordPress.
- Ability to upload files, specifically SVG files, through the plugin's interface.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.4.7.
