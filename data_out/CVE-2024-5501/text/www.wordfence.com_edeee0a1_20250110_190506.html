### Description

The Supreme Modules Lite – Divi Theme, Extra Theme and Divi Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘button\_one\_id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.51 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
