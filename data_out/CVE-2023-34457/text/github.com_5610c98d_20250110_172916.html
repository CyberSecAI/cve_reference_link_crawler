## Breaking changes

* To prevent malicious web servers from reading arbitrary files from the client, files must now be opened explicitly by the user in order to upload their contents in form submission. For example, instead of:

  ```
  browser["upload"] = "/path/to/file"
  ```

  you would now use:

  ```
  browser["upload"] = open("/path/to/file", "rb")
  ```

  This remediates [CVE-2023-34457](https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/security/advisories/GHSA-x456-3ccm-m6j4). Our thanks to [@e-c-d](https://github.com/e-c-d) for reporting and helping to fix the vulnerability!

## Main changes

* Added support for Python 3.11.
* Allow submitting a form with no submit element. This can be achieved by passing `submit=False` to `StatefulBrowser.submit_selected`. Thanks [@alexreg](https://github.com/alexreg)! [[#480](https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/pull/411)]
