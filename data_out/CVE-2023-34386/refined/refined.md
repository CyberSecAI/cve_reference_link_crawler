- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WPC Smart Wishlist for WooCommerce plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies from case to case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can craft malicious links or forms and trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking on a crafted link or submitting a crafted form. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
