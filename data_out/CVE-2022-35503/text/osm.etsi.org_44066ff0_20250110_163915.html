## WHAT IS OSM?

OSM is developing an open source Management and Orchestration (MANO) stack aligned with ETSI NFV Information Models. As a community-led project, OSM delivers a production-quality MANO stack that meets operators' requirements for commercial NFV deployments.

## ETSI NFV Alignment

OSM is closely aligned with the evolution of ETSI NFV and provides a regularly updated reference implementation of NFV MANO.

## Open Source

ETSI OSM uses well-established tools and methods to develop code under the Apache Public License 2.0.

## Open Community

Participation to OSM is open to members and non-members of ETSI, as well as individual developers and end users from all across the globe. Check [how to join](/about/how-to-join) or learn more [about OSM](/wikipub).

## WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

“Operational effectiveness at the edge is critical to a successful 5G strategy and emerging business models for edge-based compute. OSM Release SIX connects edge and core to provide repeatable and reusable services that span the full telco topology and enable both 5G infrastructure and third-party app ecosystems for the edge in VMs and containers.”

**Mark Shuttleworth**

CEO of Canonical and founder of Ubuntu

“Management and Orchestration (MANO) is, at the same time, one of the key components and most controversial concepts in network virtualization architecture. Telefónica has long been working from the point of view of innovation in its development. A first result and seed of OSM is OpenMANO, a highly functional framework pioneering the first open source NFV Orchestration and Management stack and, currently, a key component of Telefónica’s NFV Reference Lab. By joining this community, we aim to accelerate the development of MANO while recognizing the value of open-source implementations of NFV and a need to harmonize efforts there.”

**Antonio Elizondo**

Head of Network Virtualisation Strategy and Technology, Global CTO Unit, Telefónica

“OSM has evolved from an interesting PoC into the most promising architecture for orchestrating VNFs, under the multi-vendor, standardized approach that our Telco customers have been looking for. Increased robustness, as well as exciting features that pave the path towards 5G and the Edge, let us build with confidence the second release of our distribution, WhiteNFV Barcelona, in order to cover the increased demand for operator-led, automated NFV deployments.”

**Joris Vleminckx**

COO Whitestack

“ETSI OSM complements the work of the ETSI NFV ISG and vice versa. It will provide an opportunity to capitalize on the synergy between standardization and open source approaches by accessing a greater and more diverse set of contributors and developers than would normally be possible. This maximizes innovation, efficiency and time to market and ensures a continuing series of conformant reference implementations.”

**Luis Jorge Romero**

Director General (2011-2024), ETSI

![](/images/patrick waldemar-telenor.jpg)

“The ETSI OSG Open Source MANO (OSM) initiative will facilitate the development of open source software for management and orchestration of future networks. Knowledge, capabilities and solutions within this area will be of critical importance to Telenor when virtualizing the network for increased flexibility, faster service delivery, rapid innovation and operational efficiency.”

**Patrick Waldemar**

Vice President, Telenor Research

“Proprietary management and automation approaches have impeded NFV deployments. Service providers recognize the need for a standardized MANO information model delivered in conjunction with an open source MANO platform to cultivate a robust commercial NFV supplier ecosystem. I’m thrilled with the progress OSM has made to meet these needs and its growing industry acceptance.”

**Matt Harper**

OSM Founding Member, CTO, RIFT.io
