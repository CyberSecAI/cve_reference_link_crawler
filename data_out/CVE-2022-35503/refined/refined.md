Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the N2VC (Network to Virtualized Cloud) module's execution of shell code within the LCM (Lifecycle Management) container. This code is partially derived from user-provided values. The vulnerability exists because the module uses an incomplete deny list for validation instead of an allow list, allowing an attacker to craft inputs that bypass the checks and inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Deny List Validation:** The primary weakness is the use of a deny list for input validation. This approach is inherently flawed as it's difficult to anticipate all possible malicious inputs, which allows attackers to find ways around the filtering.
*   **Command Injection:** The user-controlled input is used to construct shell commands, making it susceptible to command injection. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the use of the `helm` command with the `--post-renderer` flag, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by crafting a malicious Helm chart.
*   **Unvalidated User Input:** The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the fact that user input, specifically from fields like `vnfd.kdu.helm-chart` in the VNFD (Virtualized Network Function Descriptor), is not properly validated before being used in command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the LCM container. This grants the attacker control of the container.
*   **Compromise of OSM Infrastructure:** Gaining access to the LCM container provides access to namespace entities where OSM is instantiated, including secrets and other services. This compromise may allow an attacker to fully control the OSM infrastructure.
*  **Lateral Movement:** An attacker can potentially compromise other connected systems, such as VIMs (Virtualized Infrastructure Managers) and Kubernetes clusters that are integrated with OSM, due to access to the Kube API credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Provided Values:** The primary attack vector is through user-provided values, specifically within the VNFD (Virtualized Network Function Descriptor), specifically the `vnfd.kdu.helm-chart` field. The namespace when instantiating a new NS is also mentioned as an attack vector.
*   **Malicious Helm Chart:** The attacker injects a malicious Helm chart that includes a `post-renderer` flag with a malicious command (e.g., `/bin/bash`) to exploit the command injection vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the OSM API:** An attacker needs to have the capability to interact with the OSM API in order to inject malicious values, e.g., while instantiating a new NS or deploying a VNFD.
*   **Knowledge of OSM Internal Processes:** The attacker needs an understanding of how OSM processes user-provided values and how it interacts with helm.
*   **Ability to Host a Helm Repository:** To exploit the `post-renderer` flag, the attacker must be able to host a Helm repository containing a malicious Helm chart.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.5 with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   The vulnerable versions include OSM releases SEVEN through FOURTEEN.
*   Patches were made in Release FIFTEEN and backported to Release FOURTEEN and TWELVE.
*   The patch included one for the NBI and another for the N2VC modules.
