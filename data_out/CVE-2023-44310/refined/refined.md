- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling the "Name" field of pages within the Page Tree menu. Specifically, user-supplied data injected into this field is not correctly processed, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation enables remote attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities within the context of the affected Liferay application.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker injects a crafted payload into the "Name" field of a page within the Page Tree menu.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least the permission level to modify the name of pages in the portal. The attacker also needs to be logged in to the application.
