This is the first release of BigBlueButton 2.5 and includes numerous new features and updates to existing ones.

Note that it runs on Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) and HTML5 client runs on Node 16.

BigBlueButton 2.5-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.5/new.html>

All fixes from BigBlueButton 2.4.x are here up to and including v2.4.4.

* refactor!(webhooks): remove from main repository [#12535](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12535) bbb-webhooks is now located at <https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-webhooks>

### Release name

In case an administrator does not want to update to the latest bionic-250 version. Use as substitute to the `-v` argument in bbb-install.sh command

`bionic-250-2.5-alpha-1`

We still recommend using `-v bionic-250`.

### Client build: 40
