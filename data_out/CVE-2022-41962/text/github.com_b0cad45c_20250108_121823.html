This is likely the last release candidate for BigBlueButton 2.4. It includes several functional fixes and a few privacy/security improvements (see below). If only minor items are reported in the coming days we plan on releasing 2.4.0 next. We'd like to encourage community memebers to try out this release and provide their feedback on [BigBlueButton-dev forum](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev) both positive or negative.

Thanks to the community members who provided feedback to the earlier 2.4 releases!

We thank Nico Heitmann, Sven Hebrok, and Juraj Somorovsky from Paderborn University who examined the BigBlueButton code base and responsibly disclosed a number of privacy and security issues that were fixed in this release.

### Release name

In case an administrator does not want to update to the latest bionic-240 version, use as substitute to the `-v` argument in bbb-install.sh command

`-----` <-- this release candidate shipped with an issue causing client crashes after user eject. Please use 2.4-rc-7 (the next release) where this was patched

We still recommend using `-v bionic-240`.

### Client build: 2421
