Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The CyberGhostVPN Windows client stores login credentials (including the email address) in cleartext within the application's memory. This data remains in memory even after the user logs out of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory:** The primary vulnerability is that sensitive login credentials are kept in memory without any form of encryption or obfuscation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who gains access to the memory space of the CyberGhostVPN application can extract login credentials and email addresses. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's CyberGhostVPN account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker having local access to the system where the CyberGhostVPN application is running. This could be through compromised user accounts or physical access to the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code or utilize tools on the target machine.
*   **Memory Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the memory space of the CyberGhostVPN application, which can be achieved through memory dumping tools like Task Manager or Process Hacker.
*   **Basic understanding of memory dumps:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of tools to analyze memory dumps and extract string information from them.
