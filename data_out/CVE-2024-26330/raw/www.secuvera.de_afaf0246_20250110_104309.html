   CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory

Summary:
   CyberGhostVPN is multi-platform VPN application with focus on personal privacy.
   In an independent test of the Windows client, it was found that the client retains login credentials in memory until restart, even after the user has logged out.
   In addition, the client's memory contains the login email address.
   
Effect:
   Attackers who have access to the memory area of the application, e.g. a regular Windows user who creates a memory dump using the Task Manager, can gain knowledge of credentials used to login to CyberGhostVPN.

Example:
   1. Install CyberGhostVPN Windows Application Version (v8.4.3.12823, downloaded 2024-02-01)
   3. Login to CyberGhostVPN using your credentials.
   4. Log Out
   6. Create a memory dump (used Process Hacker v2.39.124)
   7. Search for your login credentials in dump (PowerShell command given)
      strings64.exe <dumpfile> | Select-String <Login Email / Login Password>
   8. Close CyberGhostVPN completely
   9. Restart CyberGhostVPN
   10. Create a second memory dump
   11. Search again for your login credentials in the second dump
         -> Cannot be found
