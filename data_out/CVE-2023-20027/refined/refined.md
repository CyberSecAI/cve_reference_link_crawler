- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper reassembly of large packets when Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly (VFR) is enabled on a tunnel interface or a physical interface with a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) greater than 4,615 bytes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (CWE-416). The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco IOS XE Software handles the reassembly of fragmented IPv4 packets when VFR is enabled. Specifically, it occurs when large packets are fragmented and then reassembled by VFR.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can cause the device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending fragmented packets through a VFR-enabled interface on an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted fragmented packets.
