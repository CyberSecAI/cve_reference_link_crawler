GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Brownﬁeld Connectivity – Client is a Software, which is installed on SINUMERIK and collects PLC & NC
data and send them to the Brownﬁeld Connectivity – Gateway.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-1292

The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS
Command (’OS Command Injection’)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-1343

Under certain circumstances, the command line OCSP verify function reports successful veriﬁcation
when the variﬁcation in fact failed.
In this case the incorrect successful response will also be
accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful
result.

CWE-295: Improper Certiﬁcate Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2022-1434

When using the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite, which is disabled by default, an attacker is able to modify data
in transit due to an incorrect use of the AAD data as the MAC key in OpenSSL 3.0. An attacker is not
able to decrypt any communication.

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

Vulnerability CVE-2022-1473

The used OpenSSL version improperly reuses memory when decoding certiﬁcates or keys. This can
lead to a process termination and Denial of Service for long lived processes.
