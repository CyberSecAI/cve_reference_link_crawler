Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` endpoint in Sylius allows retrieval of order adjustments using an incremental integer ID. This makes it possible for attackers to guess valid IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint discloses sensitive information, specifically order tokens, associated with adjustments.
*   **Predictable IDs:** The use of incremental integer IDs allows for easy enumeration of valid adjustment IDs.
*  **Lack of proper access control:** The endpoint doesn't restrict access based on user roles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Guest Customer Order Details:** By obtaining order tokens, an attacker can access the details of guest customer orders, which can contain sensitive personal information.
*   **Enumeration of valid IDs:** The attacker is able to enumerate all valid adjustments and the related order tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Request:** Attacker sends GET requests to `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` with incrementing integer values as the `id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's API endpoint.
*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

* The advisory includes suggested workarounds that can be used if upgrading to the patched version isn't immediately possible.
* The advisory mentions that the fix is to ensure the endpoint always returns a 404 status, preventing access to any adjustment data.
* This is a High severity issue due to the sensitive information that could be exposed.
* The provided CWE is CWE-200 which is information disclosure.
