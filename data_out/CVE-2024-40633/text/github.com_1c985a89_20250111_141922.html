# Ability to retrieve Adjustments with an incremental integer ID in an API endpoint

High

[GSadee](/GSadee)
published
GHSA-55rf-8q29-4g43
Jul 17, 2024

## Package

Sylius/Sylius
(PHP)

## Affected versions

<1.12 <1.12.19 || >=1.13 <1.13.4

## Patched versions

1.12.19 || 1.13.4

## Description

### Impact

A security vulnerability was discovered in the `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` endpoint, which retrieves order adjustments based on incremental integer IDs. The vulnerability allows an attacker to enumerate valid adjustment IDs and retrieve order tokens. Using these tokens, an attacker can access guest customer order details - sensitive guest customer information.

### Patches

The issue is fixed in versions: 1.12.19, 1.13.4 and above. The `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` will always return `404` status.

### Workarounds

Using YAML configuration:

Create `config/api_platform/Adjustment.yaml` file:

```
# config/api_platform/Adjustment.yaml

'%sylius.model.adjustment.class%':
    itemOperations:
        shop_get:
            controller: ApiPlatform\Core\Action\NotFoundAction
            read: false
            output: false
```

Or using XML configuration:

Copy the original configuration from vendor:

```
cp vendor/sylius/sylius/src/Sylius/Bundle/ApiBundle/Resources/config/api_resources/Adjustment.xml config/api_platform
```

And change the `shop_get` operation in copied `config/api_platform/Adjustment.xml` file:

```
<!-- config/api_platform/Adjustment.xml -->

...
<itemOperation name="shop_get">
    <attribute name="method">GET</attribute>
    <attribute name="path">/shop/adjustments/{id}</attribute>
    <attribute name="controller">ApiPlatform\Core\Action\NotFoundAction</attribute>
    <attribute name="read">false</attribute>
    <attribute name="output">false</attribute>
</itemOperation>
...
```
