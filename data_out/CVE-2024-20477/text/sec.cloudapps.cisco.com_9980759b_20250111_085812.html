For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndhs-uaapi-Jh4V6zpN>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Nexus Dashboard and Cisco NDFC, regardless of device configuration.  **Note:** Starting with Cisco Nexus Dashboard Release 3.1(1k), Cisco NDFC is distributed in Cisco Nexus Dashboard unified releases.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug IDs at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:    + Nexus Dashboard Insights   + Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO)  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20438: Cisco NDFC Unauthorized REST API Endpoints Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to read or write files on an affected device.  This vulnerability exists because of missing authorization controls on some REST API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited *network-admin* functions such as reading device configuration information, uploading files, and modifying uploaded files.  **Note:** This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug IDs: [CSCwj09986](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj09986), [CSCwj33029](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj33029)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20438Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L  **CVE-2024-20441: Cisco NDFC Unauthorized REST API Endpoint Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in a specific REST API endpoint of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to learn sensitive information on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls on the affected REST API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to the affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download config only or full backup files and learn sensitive configuration information. This vulnerability only affects a specific REST API endpoint and does not affect the web-based management interface.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID: [CSCwk04220](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk04220)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20441Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.7CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2024-20442: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Unauthorized REST API Endpoints Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform limited *Administrator* actions on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls on some REST API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited *Administrator* functions such as viewing portions of the web UI, generating config only or full backup files, and deleting tech support files. This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID: [CSCwk04255](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk04255)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20442Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2024-20477: Cisco NDFC Unauthorized REST API Endpoint Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in a specific REST API endpoint of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to upload or delete files on an affected device.  This vulnerability exists because of missing authorization controls on the affected REST API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to the affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files into a specific container or delete files from a specific folder within that container. This vulnerability only affects a specific REST API endpoint and does not affect the web-based management interface.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID: [CSCwk11265](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk11265)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20477Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
