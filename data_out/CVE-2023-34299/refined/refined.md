- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer during the parsing of CO files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious CO file or a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability. The user is required to interact with this malicious file or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious CO file or webpage. The target user must open the malicious file or visit the malicious webpage.
