Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "loginname" parameter during failed login attempts. This unsanitized input is then logged and later displayed to administrators.
*   The application uses an XSS sanitization library, but it was bypassed by crafting an XSS payload using Vue.js data binding and interpolation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Blind XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** User-supplied input is stored in the system logs without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute when an administrator views the logs.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input effectively, particularly with respect to Vue.js data binding syntax (`{{` and `}}`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Application Compromise:** An unauthenticated attacker can compromise the Froxlor application by forcing the administrator to perform actions, such as adding a new administrator account controlled by the attacker.
*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive data, including login credentials, session tokens, and personally identifiable information (PII).
*   **Application Defacement:** The vulnerability can be used to deface the application.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker can force the administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted HTTP request.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires an administrator to view the system logs for the malicious script to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Froxlor application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker injects a malicious payload within the `loginname` parameter during a failed login attempt. This payload exploits Vue.js data binding using `{{` and `}}` to execute JavaScript when the log entry is viewed by an administrator.
*   The vulnerable code logs failed login attempts including the provided username, as seen in the provided screenshots (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
*   The malicious payload crafts a form submission which creates a new administrator account, allowing the attacker to gain access using the new credentials.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by implementing additional sanitization of user input in the login field
*   Specifically sanitizing `{{` and `}}` characters is recommended to prevent data binding and interpolation via Vue.js.
*  Sanitize javascript functions

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as GHSA-x525-54hf-xr53.
*   The vulnerable versions are < 2.1.9, and the patched version is 2.1.9.
*   The provided screenshots (Figure 1-5) and video POC illustrate the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it, and show how the attacker exploits the vulnerability and the result of the XSS execution.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.7, indicating a critical severity.
