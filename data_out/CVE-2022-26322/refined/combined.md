This Readme comprises the following sections:

* [Overview](#Overview)
* [System Requirements](#System_Requirements)
* [Upgrading the Driver](#Upgrading_the_Driver)
* [Technical Support Information](#tech_supp_info)

## Overview

This update is applicable for REST drivers running Identity Manager 4.8.x, or later. The driver version will be changed to 1.1.2.0300 after the patch is applied.

## System Requirements

- Identity Manager 4.8.x, or later
## Upgrading the Driver

The driver upgrade process involves the following tasks:

* [Upgrading the Driver Packages](#Upgrading_the_driver_packages)
* [Upgrading the Driver Files](#Upgrading_the_driver_files)

### Upgrading the Driver Packages

**Note:** No new packages have been shipped as part of this release.

### Upgrading the Driver Files

1. Take a back-up of the current driver configuration.

3. (Conditional) If the driver is running locally, stop the driver instance and the Identity Vault.

5. (Conditional) If the driver is running with a Remote Loader instance, stop the driver and the Remote Loader instance.

7. Download and unzip the contents of the *IDM\_REST\_1.1.2\_P3.zip* file to a temporary location on your computer.

9. (Conditional) To update the driver files as a root user:

* For **Identity Manager 4.8.x version**:

  2. On the server where you want apply the driver patch, log in as root.

  4. Navigate to the extracted  *<IDM\_REST\_1.1.2\_P3.zip>*  directory and perform one of the following actions for your platform:

  + **Linux:** Install the new *netiq-DXMLRESTDrv.rpm* in your driver installation directory by running one of the following command in a terminal window:

  - If you are upgrading the patch, run the following command:

  *rpm -Uvh (patch-path)/linux/netiq-DXMLRESTDrv.rpm*+ **Windows:** Copy the *RESTCommon.jar*, *RESTDriverShim.jar*, *RESTUtil.jar* files to your driver installation folder. For example, *\NetIQ\IdentityManager\NDS* (local installation) or *\Novell\RemoteLoader\64bit* (remote installation).7. Restart eDirectory or Remote Loader (RL) Instance

12. (Conditional) To update the driver files as a non-root user:

1. Verify that <non-root edirectory="" location="">*/rpm* directory exists and contains *\_db.\** file.

The *\_db.\** file is created during a non-root installation of the Identity Manager engine. Absence of this file might indicate that Identity Manager is not properly installed. Reinstall Identity Manager to correctly place the file in the directory.

3. To set the root directory to the location of non-root Identity Vault, enter the following command in the command prompt:

*ROOTDIR=<non-root eDirectory location>*

This will set the environmental variables to the directory where Identity Vault is installed as a non-root user.

6. To install the driver files, enter the following command:

For example, to install the REST driver RPM, use this command:

*rpm --dbpath $ROOTDIR/rpm -Uvh --relocate=/usr=$ROOTDIR/opt/novell/eDirectory --relocate=/etc=$ROOTDIR/etc --relocate=/opt/novell/eDirectory=$ROOTDIR/opt/novell/eDirectory --relocate=/opt/novell/dirxml=$ROOTDIR/opt/novell/dirxml --relocate=/var=$ROOTDIR/var --badreloc --nodeps --replacefiles /home/user/netiq-DXMLRESTDrv.rpm*

15. (Conditional) If the driver is running locally, start the Identity Vault and the driver instance.

17. (Conditional) If the driver is running with a Remote Loader instance, start the Remote Loader instance and the driver instance.
