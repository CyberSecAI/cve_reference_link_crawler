Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `SEMCMS_Download.php` file, specifically within the `lgid` parameter. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `lgid` parameter.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to adequately validate user-supplied input before using it in a database query. Although the code attempts to filter SQL keywords, it can be bypassed.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive database information.
    *   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker may be able to modify or delete data in the database.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious GET request to `SEMCMS_Download.php` with a crafted `lgid` parameter. For example: `http://127.0.0.1:8002/e2aLvD_Admin/SEMCMS_Download.php?lgid=-1 or 1`.
    *   **Bypassing Filters**: The provided code shows that the filter is bypassed by using `regexp` instead of keywords.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
    *   **No Authentication Required**: The exploit can be executed by an attacker without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided content includes a python script for testing this vulnerability by extracting the database name.
* The content shows how the application attempts to prevent SQL injection by using `inject_check_sql()` but fails due to poor implementation.
