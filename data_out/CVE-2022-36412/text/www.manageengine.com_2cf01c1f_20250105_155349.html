## V3 API authentication bypass vulnerability in SupportCenter Plus

**Severity :** Critical

**CVE ID :** CVE-2022-36412

**Affected software version(s) :** 11022, 11021, and 11020. Other versions remain unaffected.

**Fixed version(s) :** 11023

**Fixed on :** July 21, 2022

**Details**

This vulnerability allows an adversary to perform multiple operations using V3 APIs in SupportCenter Plus without the necessary credentials. The lack of a proper mechanism to flush out the previously authenticated users' credentials allows non-login users to perform V3 API operations.

**Impact**

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to perform any V3 API operations as someone else.

**How have we fixed it?**

We are now using proper API authentication to wipe the credentials of previous users.

**Steps to upgrade**

Customers must upgrade to the latest version of SupportCenter Plus (11023) using the [appropriate migration path listed here](https://www.manageengine.com/products/support-center/service-packs.html).

**Work-around/Fix**

Customers must upgrade to the latest version of SupportCenter Plus (11023).
