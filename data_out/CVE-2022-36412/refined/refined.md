- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of a proper mechanism to flush out the previously authenticated users' credentials. This allows non-login users to perform V3 API operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  API authentication bypass. Specifically, the system fails to invalidate or clear credentials of previously authenticated users, allowing subsequent unauthenticated requests to potentially inherit or utilize these credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can perform any V3 API operations as if they were someone else, effectively gaining unauthorized access to functionalities and data through the API.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the V3 API of SupportCenter Plus.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need to be authenticated, but they need to be able to send requests to the V3 API.
