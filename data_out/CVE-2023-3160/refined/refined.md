- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the misuse of ESET's file operations during a module update, allowing an attacker to delete or move files without proper permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation issue that allows a user to misuse the ESET GUI to plant malicious files and later misuse file operations by ESET's updater.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete or move arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: A user logged on to the system can plant malicious files in specific folders and then exploit ESET's updater component to perform file operations without proper permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a user account on the system.
