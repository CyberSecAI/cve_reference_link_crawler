# Fides Webserver Vulnerable to Zip Bomb File Uploads

Low

[daveqnet](/daveqnet)
published
GHSA-g95c-2jgm-hqc6
Jul 18, 2023

## Package

pip

ethyca-fides
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.16.0

## Patched versions

2.16.0

## Description

### Impact

The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit a weakness in the connector template upload feature to upload a malicious zip bomb file, resulting in resource exhaustion and service unavailability for all users of the Fides webserver.

This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading. If an attack occurs, the impact can be mitigated by manually or automatically restarting the affected container.

### References

More information about this type of vulnerability can be found at the following links:

* <https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/>
* <https://python-security.readthedocs.io/security.html#archives-and-zip-bomb-cve-2019-9674>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-37480
