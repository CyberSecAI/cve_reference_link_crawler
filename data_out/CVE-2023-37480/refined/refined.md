The provided content relates to CVE-2023-37480.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to a lack of proper validation on uploaded zip files used for connector templates. Specifically, it was possible to upload a malicious "zip bomb" file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload leading to resource exhaustion.
- Lack of size validation or sanitization on uploaded zip files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to resource exhaustion on the Fides webserver, causing service unavailability for all users.
- This can disrupt operations and potentially lead to data loss or corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack, where a malicious zip file is uploaded via the connector template upload feature of the Fides webserver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope. This includes root users and users with the owner role.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Fides versions 2.11.0 through 2.15.1.
- The fix involves implementing a zip file validation function (`verify_zip`) that checks the size of files within a zip archive before extraction. This prevents the "zip bomb" from causing resource exhaustion. The fix was introduced in version 2.16.0
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
- The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) associated with this issue is CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Insufficiently Large Compressed Data).
