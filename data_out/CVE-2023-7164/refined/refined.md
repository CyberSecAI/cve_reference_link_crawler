- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The BackWPup plugin does not prevent directory listing in its temporary backup folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows unauthenticated access to the temporary backup directory due to improper directory listing configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can download backups of the site's database, leading to sensitive data exposure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can directly access the backup directory via the web server if directory listing is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication and has to be able to access the web server hosting the vulnerable site. The server must also have directory listing enabled for the plugin's temporary backup directory.
