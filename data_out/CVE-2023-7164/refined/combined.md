## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# BackWPup < 4.0.4 - Unauthenticated Backup Download

### Description

The plugin does not prevent Directory Listing in its temporary backup folder, allowing unauthenticated attackers to download backups of a site's database.

### Proof of Concept

1) Ensure that Apache is configured with the ability to list directory content.
2) When this is done, you can see the backup directory.
3) When the backup is in progress, you can access the backup at: http://your\_site/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/backwpup-{hash}-temp/db.sql

### Affects Plugins
