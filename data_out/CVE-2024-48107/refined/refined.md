Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-48107:

**Verification:**

The content from `gist.github.com` explicitly mentions `CVE-2024-48107` and states that `SparkShop <= 1.1.7` is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This directly relates to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a vulnerability that allows a malicious actor to make requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Scan internal networks and potentially access sensitive information or services not exposed to the public internet.
    *   Make requests to external services from the server, possibly to leak internal information or potentially cause other damage.
    *   Potentially gain access to internal systems or other resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to find an input vector or parameter that allows them to inject an arbitrary URL into an application component that makes network requests. This could include parameters passed to functions making the requests, for example in image upload, or URL parsing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable SparkShop application. This could potentially be achieved through the public-facing interface. Specific details about the input vector or vulnerable component are not provided.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided GitHub Gist is more detailed than the CVE description, which is a placeholder.
