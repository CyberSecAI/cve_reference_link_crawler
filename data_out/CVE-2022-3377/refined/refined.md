- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected product (Horner Automation Cscape) does not properly validate user-supplied data. Specifically, opening a maliciously crafted FNT file can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824) leading to an out-of-bounds memory read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the current process by accessing an uninitialized pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds memory read.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a maliciously crafted FNT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious FNT file to a user of the vulnerable software. This is a local attack, and no special privileges are required. The user must take the action of opening the malicious file.
