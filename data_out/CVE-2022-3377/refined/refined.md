Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-3377:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to the affected product (Horner Automation Cscape) not properly validating user-supplied data when processing FNT files. Specifically, the software accesses an uninitialized pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds memory read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer:** The core issue is that the software attempts to use a pointer that has not been properly initialized, leading to unpredictable memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within the current process. The uninitialized pointer leads to an out-of-bounds memory read, which could be leveraged for code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through opening a maliciously crafted FNT file using the vulnerable Cscape software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the Cscape software is installed. They also need to be able to trick a user into opening a malicious FNT file.
- The user interaction is required, i.e., the user must open the crafted FNT file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The document indicates that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
- The document also notes that the attack complexity is low.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The affected product versions include Cscape Version 9.90 SP 6 and prior.
- Horner Automation recommends updating to the latest version of Cscape, version 9.90 SP8, to mitigate the vulnerability.
