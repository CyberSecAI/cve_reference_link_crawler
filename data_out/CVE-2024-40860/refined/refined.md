**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A logic issue within the `sudo` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the logic of the `sudo` component. This allowed for a bypass of intended security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An app could exploit this vulnerability to modify protected parts of the file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
A malicious application needs to be present on the system, and then use the flawed logic to bypass file system protections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have an application running on the target machine. There is no indication of specific access level needed, but given the impact is modifying protected parts of the file system, some form of access is needed for the app to be running in the first place.
