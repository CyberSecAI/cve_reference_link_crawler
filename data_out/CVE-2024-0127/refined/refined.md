**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0127

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the GPU kernel driver of the vGPU Manager. This occurs when a user of the guest OS compromises the guest OS kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation (CWE-20)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code execution
- Escalation of privileges
- Data tampering
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access (AV:L)
- Low attack complexity (AC:L)
- Low privileges required (PR:L)
- No user interaction required (UI:N)
- Scope is unchanged (S:U)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have compromised the guest OS kernel in order to exploit the improper input validation vulnerability. This implies the attacker has some degree of control within the virtualized environment.
