## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Fancy Product Designer < 6.1.81 - Admin+ Cross Site Scripting via Product Title

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Note: This requires WooCommerce to be installed.
1. As an admin, navigate to: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=fancy\_product\_designer
2. Add or modify a product title to contain the payload: `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS-Product-TitleModified/)//`
3. Save the results.
4. Edit/create a product in the editor via `Products > All Products`
5. You will see the XSS pop-up.
