- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A regression in Vault removed the functionality that HMAC'd sensitive headers in the configured audit device, specifically client tokens and token accessors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plaintext values of client tokens and token accessors were stored in the audit log instead of their HMAC.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of client tokens and token accessors, which could allow unauthorized access to Vault.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the audit logs could obtain plaintext client tokens and token accessors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the audit logs.
