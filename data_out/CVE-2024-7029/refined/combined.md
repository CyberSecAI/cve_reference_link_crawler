### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Larry Cashdollar and Aline Eliovich of Akamai Technologies reported this vulnerability to CISA.
An anonymous third-party organization confirmed Akamai's report and identified specific affected products and firmware versions.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

AVTECH SECURITY Corporation has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of the affected products are encouraged to contact [AVTECH](https://www.avtech.com.tw/ContactUs.aspx) for additional information.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

## Executive summary

* The Akamai Security Intelligence and Response Team (SIRT) has observed a botnet campaign that is abusing several previously exploited vulnerabilities, as well as a zero-day vulnerability discovered by the SIRT.
* CVE-2024-7029 (discovered by Aline Eliovich) is a command injection vulnerability found in the brightness function of AVTECH closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras that allows for remote code execution (RCE).
* Once injected, the botnet spreads a Mirai variant with string names that reference the COVID-19 virus that has been seen since at least 2020.
* We have included a list of [indicators of compromise (IOCs)](#iocs) to assist in defense against this threat.

## Introduction

The Akamai SIRT monitors and participates in a number of internal and external intelligence feeds to keep both our own and our customers’ online lives safe. We have discovered several active threats through our global honeypot network, including the one we are discussing today: [CVE-2024-7029](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7029), discovered by [Aline Eliovich](/blog?author=aline-eliovich).

This RCE zero-day vulnerability was discovered in the brightness function of AVTECH IP camera devices and allows for a **command injection to spread a Mirai variant on a target system**. This can be executed remotely with elevated privileges (running process owner.) In August 2024, CISA issued an [industrial control system (ICS) advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-214-07 "industrial control system (ICS) advisory") for this vulnerability citing lack of attack complexity, remote exploitation, and known public exploitation.

The botnet campaign targets multiple vulnerabilities outside of CVE-2024-7029, including several [AVTECH vulnerabilities](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40500), a [Hadoop YARN RCE](/search?q=hadoop%20yarn&size=n_10_n), [CVE-2014-8361](/search?q=CVE-2014-8361&size=n_10_n), and [CVE-2017-17215](/search?q=CVE-2017-17215&size=n_10_n). This follows the troubling attacker trend of using older, likely low-priority, vulnerabilities that remain unpatched to fulfill a malicious purpose.

### Catch up and patch up

If ever there was a time to catch up on your patching, it would be now — many of these vulnerabilities have an RCE element to them. Worse than that, the lack of formal CVE assignment makes it difficult to track the bug, let alone patch it.

In this blog post, we will describe the [zero-day attack](/glossary/what-is-zero-day-attack) and its impact, and present a comprehensive list of [IOCs](#iocs) for detection or mitigation ease.

## What is CVE-2024-7029?

**In short, CVE-2024-7029 is a vulnerability in AVTECH IP camera devices in which the “*brightness*” argument in the “*action*=” parameter allows for command injection**. The threat actor we observed took advantage of this vulnerability to spread a Mirai variant with string names referencing the COVID-19 virus.

### How long has it been active?

**The first active campaign we observed began on March 18, 2024, but analysis showed activity for this variant as early as December 2023**. The proof of concept (PoC) for CVE-2024-7029 has been [publicly available](https://github.com/R00tS3c/DDOS-RootSec/blob/master/Botnets/Exploits/avtech.py) since at least 2019, but it never had a proper [CVE](/blog/security/cves-what-they-are-ways-to-mitigate-their-impact) assignment until August 2024.

### Who is affected?

**This vulnerability in AVTECH IP camera devices affects up to and including AVM1203 firmware versions FullImg-1023-1007-1011-1009**. Despite the model in question having been discontinued for several years, CISA stated in their advisory that these devices are still used worldwide, including by transportation authorities and other critical infrastructure entities.

### How does it work?

This vulnerability was originally discovered by examining our honeypot logs. Figure 1 shows the decoded URL for clarity.

![Decoded payload](/site/en/images/blog/2024/2024-corona-mirai-botnet-infects-zero-day-sirt-table.jpg)
Fig. 1: Decoded payload body of the exploit attempts

The vulnerability lies in the brightness function within the file */cgi-bin/supervisor/Factory.cgi* (Figure 2).

Fig. 2: PoC of the exploit

### What could happen?

In the exploit examples we observed, essentially what happened is this: **The exploit of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute remote code on a target system**.

Figure 3 is an example of a threat actor exploiting this flaw to download and run a JavaScript file to fetch and load their main malware payload. [Similar to many other botnets](/blog/security-research/new-rce-botnet-spreads-mirai-via-zero-days), this one is also spreading a variant of Mirai malware to its targets.

![Figure 3 is an example of a threat actor exploiting this flaw to download and run a JavaScript file to fetch and load their main malware payload. ](/site/en/images/blog/2024/2024-corona-mirai-botnet-infects-zero-day-sirt-two.jpg)
Fig. 3: Strings from the JavaScript downloader

In this instance, the botnet is likely using the Corona Mirai variant, which has been referenced by [other vendors](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/how-is-the-mirai-variant-infecting-the-iot-landscape) as early as 2020 in relation to the COVID-19 virus.

Upon execution, the malware connects to a large number of hosts through Telnet on ports 23, 2323, and 37215. It also prints the string “Corona” to the console on an infected host (Figure 4).

![It also prints the string “Corona” to the console on an infected host (Figure 4). ](/site/en/images/blog/2024/2024-corona-mirai-botnet-infects-zero-day-sirt-four.jpg)

Fig. 4: Execution of malware showing output to console

Static analysis of the strings in the malware samples shows targeting of the path */ctrlt/DeviceUpgrade\_1* in an attempt to exploit Huawei devices affected by CVE-2017-17215. The samples have two hard-coded command and control IP addresses, one of which is part of the CVE-2017-17215 exploit code (Figure 5).

The botnet also targeted several other vulnerabilities including a Hadoop YARN RCE, CVE-2014-8361, and CVE-2017-17215.We have observed these vulnerabilities exploited in the wild several times, and they continue to be successful.

## Conclusion

A vulnerability without a formal CVE assignment may still pose a threat to your organization — in fact, it could be a significant threat. Malicious actors who operate these botnets have been using new or under-the-radar vulnerabilities to proliferate [malware](/glossary/what-is-malware). CVE-2024-7029 is another example of using the latter, which is becoming an increasingly popular attack trend observed by the SIRT.

There are many vulnerabilities with public exploits or available PoCs that lack formal CVE assignment, and, in some cases, the devices remain unpatched. Managing patch priorities is arduous, especially when the threats have no available patch. If there is no way to remediate a threat, decommissioning the hardware and software is the recommended way to mitigate security risks and lower the risk of regulatory fines.
