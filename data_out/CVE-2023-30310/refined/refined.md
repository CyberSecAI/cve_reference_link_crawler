The provided content describes a vulnerability related to TCP hijacking in NAT-enabled Wi-Fi networks. This content is related to CVE-2023-30310 because this vulnerability was discovered and published by the same authors at the NDSS Symposium 2024, according to external sources such as https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30310.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root Cause:**

*   A side-channel vulnerability in the NAT port preservation strategy used by Wi-Fi routers.
*   Insufficient reverse path validation strategy of Wi-Fi routers.
*   Routers disabling TCP window tracking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **NAT Port Preservation Weakness:** The NAT implementation in affected routers doesn't properly protect against attackers inferring the existence of TCP connections based on side-channel information.
*   **Insufficient Reverse Path Validation:** The routers do not adequately validate the origin of TCP packets, allowing an off-path attacker to inject packets.
*   **Disabled TCP Window Tracking:** The lack of TCP window tracking allows attackers to manipulate the TCP connection without proper state validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **TCP Hijacking:** An off-path attacker can intercept TCP packets.
*   **Connection Termination:** The attacker can forcibly close the victim's TCP connection.
*   **Traffic Poisoning:** The attacker can inject malicious data into the TCP stream, potentially affecting the user's experience.
*  **Traffic Redirection:** The attacker can redirect server's incoming packets to the attacker, potentially allowing man-in-the-middle attacks and data exfiltration.
*  **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can obtain the current sequence and acknowledgment numbers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Off-Path Attack:** The attacker does not need to be on the direct path between the client and the server.
*   **Fake TCP Packets:** The attacker sends forged TCP packets to the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in the same network vicinity as the vulnerable Wi-Fi network.
*   Ability to craft and send TCP packets.
*   The attacker does not need to be on-path between the client and server.

**Additional details:**

*   The research tested 67 routers from 30 vendors, with 52 being vulnerable.
*   Out of 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks, 75 (81%) were found to be vulnerable.
*   The paper mentions successful attacks involving SSH, FTP and HTTP.
*   The researchers responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to vendors.
