- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect HTTP packet handling in the Snort 3 Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to bypass configured IPS rules. This is due to improper processing of HTTP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass configured IPS rules, permitting uninspected traffic onto the network. This can lead to further attacks or unauthorized network access.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP packets through an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
