- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses a hard-coded, constant key for encryption and a static, non-random Initialization Vector (IV) for Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode in AES encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password**: A constant key (`salt=eCcGFZQj6PNoSSma31LR39rTzTbLkU8E`) is used for encryption, making it easy to obtain and decrypt data.
    - **CWE-329: Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode**: A static IV (`IV=0000000000000000`) is used across encryption operations, creating a vulnerability where patterns in encrypted data may be exploited.
    - **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**: The hardcoded salt is an example of an insufficient random value used in a cryptographic operation.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Decryption of sensitive data encrypted using the hardcoded key.
    - Potential disclosure of information about the plaintext of subsequent messages due to the predictable IV.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Access to the source code or the constant key, allowing an attacker to decrypt the data.
    - Exploitation of patterns due to the static IV used in the CBC mode of AES encryption.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to access the application's source code or the hardcoded key.
    - Basic knowledge of cryptographic attacks.
