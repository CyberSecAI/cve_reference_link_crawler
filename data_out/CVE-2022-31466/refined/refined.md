- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition exists. The software checks a file for malware, but before the delete/quarantine action is performed, the file is replaced with a symlink. The software then follows the symlink without proper validation, leading to actions on unintended files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** TOCTOU race condition, failure to detect and validate symlinks before performing privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary file deletion on the system protected by self-protection, bypassing Quick Heal's self-protection mechanisms.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker can create a symlink after a malware check and before the delete/quarantine action is performed by Quick Heal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access with the ability to create symlinks. Requires user interaction to trigger the malware scan which leads to deletion.
