# CVE-2022-31466: Quick Heal Total Security before 12.1.1.27 has a TOCTOU race condition that leads to privilege escalation

**Description:**
[CVE-2022-31466](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-31466): Quick Heal Total Security before 12.1.1.27 has a TOCTOU race condition that leads to privilege escalation.

**Details:**
A Privilege escalation vulnerability was reported in the Quick Heal Total Security version prior to 12.1.1.27 that could allow an adversary to bypass Quick Heal’s self-protection. It may follow a symlink that was created after a malware check.

**CVSS Score:** 7.9 High
<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:U/RC:R>

**Security Impact:**
Could potentially be abused to delete an arbitrary file on the system protected by self-protection.

**Technical Root Cause of the vulnerability**
1. Essentially a Time of Check, Time of Use issue (TOCTOU), where malware is detected first but when the delete/quarantine action has performed the file has changed to a symlink
2. Failure to detect a symlink and blindly following the symlink path to perform high privilege actions

**Date of Publication:** May 23rd, 2022

**Remediation**:
Quick Heal Total Security users are recommended to upgrade to v12.1.1.27 and above.
