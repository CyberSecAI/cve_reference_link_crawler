Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   mRemoteNG loads configuration files into memory in plain text after decrypting them, even if no connections have been established. This occurs at application startup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory (CWE-316):** Decrypted connection configurations, including usernames and passwords, are stored in the application's memory in plain text.
*   **Bypass of Encryption:** The vulnerability bypasses the connection configuration file encryption setting, because the decrypted data is exposed in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of User Credentials:** Attackers can access plaintext connection credentials (usernames, passwords) through memory dumps.
*   **Access to Configuration Details:** Full configuration files, including server addresses and other sensitive data, are exposed.
*   If no custom encryption key is set by the user, then even the encrypted passwords within the configuration file can be decrypted using mRemoteNG's default key `mR3m`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Memory Dump:** Attackers can use tools like Task Manager, Processhacker, or Procdump to create memory dumps of the mRemoteNG process.
*   **Malware Execution:** Malicious actors with local access to a user's system can use tools such as the provided `mRemoteNGDumper.exe` to extract the data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** Attackers require local access to the system where mRemoteNG is running.
*   **Ability to Create Memory Dumps:** Attackers need the ability to create process memory dumps.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects mRemoteNG versions <= v1.76.20 and <= v1.77.3-dev.
*   The vulnerability exists even when connection configuration files are encrypted on disk.
*   A proof-of-concept tool, `mRemoteNGDumper.exe` and `mremoteng_decrypt.py`, has been created to demonstrate the vulnerability and aid in exploitation and password decryption.
*   The configuration file password encryption is different from the connection file encryption. The configuration file encryption is for the passwords only, and the connection file encryption encrypts the entire file on the disk.
*   The `mremoteng_decrypt.py` script can also bruteforce custom password encryption keys.
