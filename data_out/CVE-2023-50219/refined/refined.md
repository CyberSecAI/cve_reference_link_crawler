Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `RunQuery` class, leading to the deserialization of untrusted data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Deserialization of untrusted data is the core weakness. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the affected Inductive Automation Ignition installations, leading to a complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
