The provided content is related to CVE-2024-26647.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A null pointer dereference exists in the `link_set_dsc_pps_packet()` function within the AMD display driver. The code dereferences the `dsc` pointer before checking if it is NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to access `dsc->ctx->logger` before validating that `dsc` is not NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash: Dereferencing a NULL pointer will likely result in a kernel panic and system crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `link_set_dsc_pps_packet` function is called with a `pipe_ctx` that has a `stream_res.dsc` member set to NULL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `link_set_dsc_pps_packet` function with a specific configuration where `pipe_ctx->stream_res.dsc` is NULL. This would likely require a specific configuration related to display stream compression (DSC).

The provided diffs demonstrate the fix, which involves reordering the NULL check to occur before dereferencing the `dsc` pointer.
