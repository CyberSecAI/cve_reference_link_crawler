{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `formExpandDlnaFile` function in Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.05 firmware is vulnerable to a stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A stack buffer overflow exists because the `filePath` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overwrite the return address of the function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address of the function. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to `/goform/expandDlnaFile` where the `filePath` parameter contains an overly long string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
