- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability in the `streamfwd` process within the Splunk App for Stream allows for privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege management in the `streamfwd` process (CWE-269).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A low-privileged user can escalate their privileges to root or other higher-level accounts on the machine running the Splunk Enterprise instance. This includes the ability to read, write, and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is locally exploitable, meaning an attacker would need local access to the machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user on the system running the vulnerable Splunk instance.
