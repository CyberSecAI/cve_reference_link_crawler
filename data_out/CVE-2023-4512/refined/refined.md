Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Uncontrolled recursion in the CBOR dissector when parsing indefinite-length byte strings or text strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `dissect_cbor_byte_string()` and `dissect_cbor_text_string()` functions in `epan/dissectors/packet-cbor.c` lack a recursion limit.
- The functions recursively call themselves when encountering a CBOR byte string element of indefinite length, if specific conditions are met in the parsing loop.
- Specifically, if the `eof_type` byte is `0x5f`, the function will recurse indefinitely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack overflow, leading to a crash (Denial of Service).
- Consumption of excessive resources on the target machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injecting a malformed packet onto the network.
- Convincing a user to open a crafted packet capture file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and send network packets or craft packet capture files.
- No specific privileges are required, as the vulnerability is triggered during packet processing by the Wireshark application.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability lies in the while loop within `dissect_cbor_byte_string()` and `dissect_cbor_text_string()`.
- When parsing an indefinite-length CBOR string, the code checks the `eof_type` byte (offset+1).
- A crafted `eof_type` of `0x5f` leads to recursive calls without termination.
- The recursive call occurs at `packet-cbor.c:390`
- The loop continues if `eof_type & 0x1f == 0x1f`
- The recursion depth can be influenced by the `gui.max_tree_depth` option.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Simone Di Maria

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.7 are affected.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.0.8.

**Additional Information:**
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) python script is provided to generate a malicious packet.
- The vulnerability is similar to other past Wireshark vulnerabilities, including CVE-2013-3562, CVE-2017-9346, CVE-2017-9766, CVE-2018-9262 and CVE-2021-39929
