Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `redirect` parameter in the authentication API not being properly validated, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary, malicious site after successful login via OAuth2/OpenID/SAML SSO providers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Open Redirection:** The `redirect` parameter in the `/auth/login/:provider_id` endpoint is vulnerable to manipulation, allowing for redirection to arbitrary URLs.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the provided `redirect` parameter against an allowlist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious sites that mimic the legitimate login page or error messages, potentially tricking users into revealing their passwords or other sensitive information.
*   **User Credential Theft:** Although credentials aren't directly passed to the attacker's site, users can be phished via social engineering into revealing their credentials on a look-alike page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based and can be performed remotely.
*   **Manipulated URL:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious `redirect` parameter in the login request. For example, a link like `directus-instance/auth/login/:provider_id?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Directus instance over the network.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to entice the victim to click on the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Directus versions <= 10.10.0.
*   The fix involves introducing an allow list for redirect URLs, configured via the `AUTH_<PROVIDER>_REDIRECT_ALLOW_LIST` environment variable.
*   The affected authentication methods are OAuth2, OpenID, and SAML SSO providers.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `5477d7d61babd7ffc2f835d399bf79611b15b203`, and the changes involve code in `api/src/auth/drivers/oauth2.ts`, `api/src/auth/drivers/openid.ts`, `api/src/auth/drivers/saml.ts`, `api/src/utils/is-login-redirect-allowed.ts`, and other related files.
*   The fix also includes adding tests to ensure the URL allow list works as expected.
