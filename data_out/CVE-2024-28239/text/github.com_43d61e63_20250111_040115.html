# CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site in OAuth2/OpenID

Moderate

[rijkvanzanten](/rijkvanzanten)
published
GHSA-fr3w-2p22-6w7p
Mar 12, 2024

## Package

npm

directus/directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 10.10.0

## Patched versions

10.10.0

## Description

### Summary

The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL <https://docs.directus.io/reference/authentication.html#login-using-sso-providers> /auth/login/google?redirect for example.

### Details

There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`, which I think is here: <https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/auth/drivers/oauth2.ts#L394>. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message "Your password needs to be updated" to phish out the current password.

### PoC

Turn on any auth provider in Directus instance. Form a link to `directus-instance/auth/login/:provider_id?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`, login and get taken to malicious-site. Tested on the `ory` OAuth2 integration.

### Impact

Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
