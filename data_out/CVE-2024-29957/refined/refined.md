- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When Brocade SANnav servers are configured in Disaster Recovery (DR) mode, the encryption key is stored in the DR log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The encryption key is stored in a less secure location (DR log files) than it should be.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially acquire the encryption key from the DR log files, leading to unauthorized access or decryption of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves accessing the DR log files where the encryption key is stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to gain access to the system where the DR logs are stored. The advisory does not specify whether this requires local or remote access, but the CVSS score indicates a network attack vector with no required privileges.
