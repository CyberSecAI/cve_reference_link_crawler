- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `fromSafeClientFilter` function in Tenda FH1201 firmware copies a user-supplied parameter `Go` into a fixed-size buffer using `strcpy`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially arbitrary code execution on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to `/goform/SafeClientFilter` with an oversized `Go` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This often means being on the same local network as the router.
