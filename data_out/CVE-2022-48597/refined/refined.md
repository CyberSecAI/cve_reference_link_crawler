**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The "ticket event report" feature of ScienceLogic SL1 takes unsanitized user-controlled input and passes it directly to a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL injection leading to potential unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data in the database, full compromise of the database

**Attack vectors:**
- User-controlled input through the "ticket event report" feature

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account with access to the "ticket event report" functionality (low-privileged access is enough according to CVSS score)
