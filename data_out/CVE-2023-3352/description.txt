The Smush plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized deletion of the resmush list due to a missing capability check on the delete_resmush_list() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to delete the resmush list for Nextgen or the Media Library.
