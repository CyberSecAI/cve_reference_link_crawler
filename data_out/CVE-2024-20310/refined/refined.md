- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM & Presence Service does not properly validate user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated remote attacker could persuade an authenticated user to click a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a legitimate user to click on it. The attacker does not require any authentication to perform the attack.
