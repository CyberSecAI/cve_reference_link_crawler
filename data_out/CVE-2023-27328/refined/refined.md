Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-27328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before they are used to construct an XML document within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- XML Injection: The core issue is the improper handling of user-provided input when creating XML, allowing for the injection of malicious XML structures.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The system fails to adequately sanitize or validate user-provided strings before their use in constructing an XML document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables a local attacker to escalate their privileges.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the hypervisor. This implies the attacker gains high level access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack: The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target guest system (the virtual machine).
- Toolgate Component: The vulnerability resides within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-Privilege Code Execution: The attacker needs to have the capability to execute low-privileged code on the guest system where Parallels Desktop is running.
- Local Access: The attack is local in nature, requiring the attacker to have some form of access to the guest system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on 2022-11-03 and a fix was released on 2022-12-13 in version 18.1.1 (53328)
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.8 with vector AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a high severity.
