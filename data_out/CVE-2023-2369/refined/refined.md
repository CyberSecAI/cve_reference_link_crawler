- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of `/eval/admin/manage_restriction.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the system by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. The provided example demonstrates the ability to extract the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to `/eval/admin/manage_restriction.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable endpoint, and can exploit it by sending a crafted HTTP GET request. The attacker does not need to be logged in, as this endpoint appears to be accessible to anyone with network access to the vulnerable server.
