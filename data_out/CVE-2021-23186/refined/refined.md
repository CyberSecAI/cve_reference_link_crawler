Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A programming error in the Odoo framework allowed for an escape from the intended database isolation in multi-tenant systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce isolation between databases in a multi-tenant setup. This allows a user with administrative privileges in one database to potentially access and modify data in other databases on the same server.
- **Sandboxing Issue**: The core of the vulnerability is a failure in sandboxing or isolation mechanisms, which should prevent tenants from interfering with each other's data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach**: A malicious administrator could read or modify data in databases belonging to other tenants.
- **Integrity Loss**: Modification of data in other databases leads to potential data corruption and integrity loss.
- **Confidentiality Breach**: Unauthorized access allows for viewing of sensitive data in other tenants databases.
- **Multi-Tenant System Risk**:  Systems hosting Odoo databases for untrusted users, such as SaaS platforms, are particularly at risk because users can often become administrators of their own databases and then leverage this vulnerability to target other tenants.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Crafted Malicious Requests:** Attackers exploit this flaw by crafting malicious requests to bypass the intended database isolation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Administrator:** The attacker needs to have an administrative user account on one of the Odoo databases in the multi-tenant system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Odoo instance to send the crafted malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Odoo Community and Enterprise Editions version 15.0 and earlier.
- No workaround is available and updating to the latest version or applying the specific patch is the recommended solution.
- Patches are available for Odoo versions 13.0, 14.0 and 15.0.
- Odoo Cloud servers were patched as soon as the correction was available.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.7 (High).
- The CVSS v3 vector is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

This vulnerability allows a malicious administrator to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of databases outside of their intended tenant, in multi-tenant Odoo systems.
