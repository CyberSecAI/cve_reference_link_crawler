The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2450.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `reSmush.it Image Optimizer` plugin lacks authorization checks for various AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin does not properly verify user permissions before executing AJAX actions. This allows any logged-in user, including those with subscriber-level privileges, to call administrative functions.
*   **Missing Authorization:** Specifically, AJAX actions such as `resmushit_bulk_get_images`, `resmushit_restore_backup_files`, `resmushit_remove_backup_files`, and `resmushit_update_statistics` are exposed to low-privileged users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Low-privileged users (e.g., subscribers) can trigger administrative actions, which may lead to:
    *   Retrieving image data.
    *   Restoring or removing backup files.
    *   Updating statistics.
* Although the impact is not high (CVSS 4.3 - Medium), it can still lead to potential manipulation or unwanted activity.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is conducted via HTTP requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **AJAX calls:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending requests to the vulnerable AJAX actions within the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the WordPress site, even with low-level privileges (e.g., subscriber role).
*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
