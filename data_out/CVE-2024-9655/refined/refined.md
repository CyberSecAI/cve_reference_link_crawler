**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Kadence Blocks plugin's Icon widget.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows authenticated attackers (with Contributor-level access or higher) to inject malicious web scripts into pages. When a user accesses a page containing the injected scripts, these scripts will execute, potentially leading to various attacks, including:
    *   Data theft through redirection or sending data to malicious servers.
    *   User impersonation.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's Icon widget. By injecting malicious web scripts in user-supplied attributes (likely related to icon settings).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have an authenticated account on the WordPress site.
    *   The attacker needs at least a "Contributor" level access or higher to be able to modify content including icon widgets in pages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article specifies the vulnerable component as the "Icon widget" within the Kadence Blocks plugin, while the trac log shows changes to a tooltip related javascript file. This suggests that the icon widget was likely using tooltips where the XSS vulnerability was present.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "Stored XSS" which means the injected script will be stored in the database.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.3.2 of the plugin.

**Summary of extracted Information:**

The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw present in the Icon widget of the Kadence Blocks plugin. It's caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied attributes, enabling authenticated users with Contributor or higher access to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers when those users visit affected pages. The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.2.
