As someone who uses WP heavily for its actual CMS features rather than as a pagebuilder, it has been a constant struggle for many years to bridge the gaps between “dynamic content” and the block editor. Every plugin—free or paid—that has claimed to do this, always falls way short in a big disappointing way. Kadence finally does it—and elegantly! Their dynamic content blocks alone (in pro version) make it worth the price of admission. This is on par with ACF with its visual design and intuitiveness, solid documentation, ability to customize with code where needed. The Advanced Query block with frontend filtering/sorting eliminates the need for other clunky disjointed solutions and puts everything in one place, while being visual and simple enough that my clients might finally be able to adjust their own queries and filters. Quickly becoming a must-have in my toolbox on every site!

Update 12/17/24
As a fan of Kadence plugin, I wanted to give it a try purchasing the Pro version for a project. They charge $150/yr, not cheap. For that it cost, I’m not impressed with what the pro version offers – average at best. For example, Custom Fonts plugin does not work with variable fonts. And Advanced Slider is not so advanced – it doesn’t display posts, only content manually input. Meh.
–
My original review below is for the free version, which is great.
I use Kadence Blocks for almost all WP projects as it offer solid essential design components. Row Layout is my most often used tool as it allows you to set columns of various sizes. Each design block allows for control settings of margin, padding, background, and structure – simply awesome. Other great essential blocks are Advanced Headings and Buttons.
