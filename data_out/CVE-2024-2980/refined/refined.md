Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formexeCommand` function of the Tenda FH1202 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the user-controlled `cmdinput` parameter into a fixed-size buffer (`v7`) without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to:
  - **Code execution:** Overwriting the return address on the stack to redirect control flow to malicious code.
  - **Denial of service:** Causing the device to crash or become unresponsive.
  - **Other potential impacts**: Depending on the specifics of the overflow and the stack layout, other forms of exploitation may be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/execCommand` endpoint.
- The attacker controls the `cmdinput` parameter, which is sent via a cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication, as the vulnerability is triggered by the `cmdinput` parameter in the cookie, which doesn't require authentication.
- The attacker needs to be on the same network or have access to the network where the vulnerable router is connected.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected firmware version is Tenda FH1202 V1.2.0.14(408).
- The `v7` buffer is fixed at 512 bytes.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the overflow using a Python script. The POC sends an HTTP GET request with a cookie that includes the `cmdinput` parameter with a string of 'A' repeated 1000 times, thus overflowing the 512 byte buffer.
