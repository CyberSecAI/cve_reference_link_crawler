**Impact of exploitation:**
- The unencrypted API key can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.
- Attackers can potentially observe and capture the API key through the global configuration form.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the Jenkins controller file system.
- Viewing the global configuration form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Jenkins controller file system
- Ability to view the global configuration form.
