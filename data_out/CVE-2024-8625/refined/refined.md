- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or unauthorized access to the database. The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands, including `SLEEP`, which can lead to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through the `orderby` parameter in the `admin.php` URL when accessing the `ts-poll` page within the WordPress admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges on the WordPress site.
