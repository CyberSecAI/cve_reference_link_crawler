  "CVE-2022-41924": {
    "root_cause": "The Tailscale Windows client's local API was bound to a local TCP socket and communicated in cleartext without Host header verification. This allowed a malicious website to perform DNS rebinding and make local API requests, including changing the coordination server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext communication on a local TCP socket",
      "Lack of Host header verification",
      "Vulnerability to DNS rebinding attacks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker-controlled coordination server could send malicious URL responses to the client, potentially leading to remote code execution by pushing executables or installing an SMB share.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious website visited by the victim",
      "DNS rebinding"
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website and have the victim visit it. They also need to control a DNS server to perform the DNS rebinding."
  },
   "CVE-2022-41925": {
        "root_cause": "The Tailscale client's peer API was vulnerable to DNS rebinding, allowing a malicious website to access it and potentially expose sensitive environment variables.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Vulnerability to DNS rebinding attacks",
             "Lack of access controls on the peer API",
            "Exposed environment variables via the peer API"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could read the node's environment variables, including authentication keys, and potentially use this information to add new nodes to the tailnet or gain access to other nodes. Also can lead to RCE via malicious file sent through Taildrop.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Malicious website visited by the victim",
             "DNS rebinding"
        ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website and have the victim visit it. They also need to control a DNS server to perform the DNS rebinding."
