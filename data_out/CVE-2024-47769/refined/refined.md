Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-47769.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the `corePublicRouter.js` file. User input for the `subPath` parameter is directly used in the `path.join` function without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-23) due to inadequate input sanitization.
- The `/public` endpoint is accessible to unauthenticated users, compounding the issue.
- The `subPath` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in `path.join`, allowing attackers to inject directory traversal sequences.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`.
- This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, potentially compromising the server and its users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/public` endpoint.
- The `subPath` parameter is manipulated by injecting URL-encoded directory traversal sequences like `%2e%2e%2f`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- The attacker must be able to craft a URL containing directory traversal sequences in the `subPath` parameter.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by sanitizing the `subPath` using `path.normalize()` and removing any leading `../` sequences before using the path in `path.join()`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates reading `/etc/passwd` by accessing the server via a malicious URL, showcasing the severity of the vulnerability.
- The fix was implemented in commit `949bc6f` by replacing the original line that used the unsanitized subPath to one that used a sanitized path.
