- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Global Content Blocks in the Administration Menu of RiteCMS 3.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:**  A crafted payload is inserted into the "body" configuration of a Global Content Block via the administration panel. This payload is then stored and executed when the content is rendered, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a low privileged account to access the administration panel and the ability to edit global content blocks.
