# Instrumentation for AWS SDK v2 captures email content when using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) v1 API, exposing that content to the telemetry backend

Moderate

published
GHSA-hghr-r469-gfq6
Aug 8, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.28.0

## Patched versions

1.28.0

## Description

**Overview**

The Amazon Distribution for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) team identified an issue related to the instrumentation of Java applications using the AWS SDK v2 with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) v1 API. When SES POST requests are instrumented, the query parameters of the request are inserted into the trace `url.path` field. This behavior leads to the http body, containing the email subject and message, to be present in the trace request url metadata. The ADOT team submitted a fix that is included in version 1.28.0 [1]

[1] [#8931](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/pull/8931)

**Scope of Impact**

Any user using a version before 1.28.0 of OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation to instrument AWS SDK v2 call to SES’s v1 SendEmail API is affected. The e-mail content sent to SES may end up in telemetry backend. This exposes the e-mail content to unintended audiences.

**Proof-of-concept**

A GitHub user opened an issue [2].

[2] [#8956](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/8956)

**Proof-of-concept Mitigation**

The issue can be mitigated by updating OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation to version 1.28.0 or later.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
