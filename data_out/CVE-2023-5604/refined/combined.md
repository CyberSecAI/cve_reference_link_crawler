## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Asgaros Forum < 2.7.1 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin allows forum administrators, who may not be WordPress (super-)administrators, to set insecure configuration that allows unauthenticated users to upload dangerous files (e.g. .php, .phtml), potentially leading to remote code execution.

### Proof of Concept

Any user who has the rights to modify the settings area of the Asgaros plugin (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=asgarosforum-options), like forum administrators, can authorize users to upload malicious files (e.g. .php, .phtml files) on the site.
