- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure configuration settings within the Asgaros Forum plugin allow for arbitrary file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The plugin does not properly restrict file types allowed for upload, leading to the possibility of uploading dangerous files, such as PHP or PHTML.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated attacker to upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution and full compromise of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can exploit this by accessing the plugin's settings page and modifying the file upload configuration to permit the upload of executable files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user and needs the ability to modify the settings area of the Asgaros plugin, which may be granted to a forum administrator who may not be a WordPress super-administrator.
