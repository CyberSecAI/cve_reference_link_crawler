| I have a fix in. I was escaping table VALUES, but not table HEADERS.  There's a build in progress, can you take a look when it's done to see if you can break it again?  build artifacts will appear here > <https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/actions/runs/1877329726>  Also you've just reminded me I need a `security@` email for reporting vulnerabilities. |
