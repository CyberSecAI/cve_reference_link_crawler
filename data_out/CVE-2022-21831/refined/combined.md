Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3093-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : rails
Version        : 2:5.2.2.1+dfsg-1+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-21831 CVE-2022-22577 CVE-2022-23633 CVE-2022-27777
                 CVE-2022-32224

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered in rails, a ruby
based MVC frame work for web development.

CVE-2022-21831

    A code injection vulnerability exists in the Active Storage that
    could allow an attacker to execute code via image_processing
    arguments.

CVE-2022-22577

    An XSS Vulnerability in Action Pack that could allow an attacker
    to bypass CSP for non HTML like responses.

CVE-2022-23633

    Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web
    requests. Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be
    closed. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`,
    `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local
    state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to
    subsequent requests.

CVE-2022-27777

    A XSS Vulnerability in Action View tag helpers which would allow
    an attacker to inject content if able to control input into
    specific attributes.

CVE-2022-32224

    When serialized columns that use YAML (the default) are
    deserialized, Rails uses YAML.unsafe_load to convert the YAML data
    in to Ruby objects. If an attacker can manipulate data in the
    database (via means like SQL injection), then it may be possible
    for the attacker to escalate to an RCE.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:5.2.2.1+dfsg-1+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

For the detailed security status of rails please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rails>

Multiple vunerabilities were discovered in rails, the Ruby based server-side
MVC web application framework, which could result in XSS, data disclosure
and open redirect.

version 2:6.0.3.7+dfsg-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

## Package

([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 5.2.0, <= 5.2.6.2
>= 6.0.0, <= 6.0.4.6
>= 6.1.0, <= 6.1.4.6
>= 7.0.0, <= 7.0.2.2

## Patched versions

5.2.6.3
6.0.4.7
6.1.4.7
7.0.2.3

## Description

The Active Storage module of Rails starting with version 5.2.0 is possibly vulnerable to code injection. This issue was patched in versions 5.2.6.3, 6.0.4.7, 6.1.4.7, and 7.0.2.3. To work around this issue, applications should implement a strict allow-list on accepted transformation methods or arguments. Additionally, a strict ImageMagick security policy will help mitigate this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVE-2022-21831 (activestorage): Possible code injection vulnerability in Rails / Active Storage

March 8th, 2022

### ADVISORIES

* [CVE-2022-21831](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21831)
  ([NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21831))
* [GHSA-w749-p3v6-hccq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w749-p3v6-hccq)
* [Vendor Advisory](https://groups.google.com/g/rubyonrails-security/c/n-p-W1yxatI)

### GEM

[activestorage](https://rubygems.org/gems/activestorage)

### FRAMEWORK

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

### SEVERITY

[CVSS v3.x](https://www.first.org/cvss/): 9.8 (**Critical**)

### UNAFFECTED VERSIONS

* `< 5.2.0`

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `~> 5.2.6, >= 5.2.6.3`
* `~> 6.0.4, >= 6.0.4.7`
* `~> 6.1.4, >= 6.1.4.7`
* `>= 7.0.2.3`

### DESCRIPTION

There is a possible code injection vulnerability in the Active Storage module
of Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2022-21831.

Versions Affected: >= 5.2.0
Not affected: < 5.2.0
Fixed Versions: 7.0.2.3, 6.1.4.7, 6.0.4.7, 5.2.6.3

## Impact

There is a possible code injection vulnerability in the Active Storage module
of Rails. This vulnerability impacts applications that use Active Storage
with the image\_processing processing in addition to the mini\_magick back end
for image\_processing.

Vulnerable code will look something similar to this:

```
&lt;%= image_tag blob.variant(params[:t] =&gt; params[:v]) %&gt;

```

Where the transformation method or its arguments are untrusted arbitrary
input.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.

## Workarounds

To work around this issue, applications should implement a strict allow-list
on accepted transformation methods or arguments. Additionally, a strict image
magick security policy will help mitigate this issue.
