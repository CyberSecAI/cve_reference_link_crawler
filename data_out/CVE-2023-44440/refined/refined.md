Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Ashlar-Vellum Lithium parses various file types. Specifically, the process loads a library from an unsecured location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The application loads a library from an unsecured location, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking or similar attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file. This makes it a user-assisted attack.
*   **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of specific file types.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious file or website to be opened or visited by the target user.
*   The attacker needs to place a malicious library file in a location where the vulnerable application will load it from, due to the unsecured library loading path.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 12.0.1204.78 of Ashlar-Vellum Lithium.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2023-08-01 and publicly released on 2023-11-14.
*   The CVSS score is 7.8, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is also known as ZDI-23-1598 and ZDI-CAN-21680
