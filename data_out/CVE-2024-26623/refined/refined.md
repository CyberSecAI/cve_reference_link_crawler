The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26623.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the `pds_core` driver, specifically related to the admin queue (`adminq`). Multiple execution paths can access and modify the `adminq`, and during device reset (PCIe or fw_down/fw_up cycles), the `adminq` can be destroyed and recreated. A NULL pointer dereference can occur if certain execution paths attempt to use the `adminq` after it has been destroyed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition: Multiple threads can attempt to access the `adminq` concurrently.
- Use-after-free: The `adminq` can be accessed after being freed during a reset cycle, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to NULL pointer dereference, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a device reset (PCIe reset or fw_down/fw_up cycle) while another thread is using the `adminq`. This can be achieved by a privileged attacker through various methods that force the device to reset

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger device resets either via PCIe or causing a fw_down/fw_up cycle, often requiring some degree of system access.
