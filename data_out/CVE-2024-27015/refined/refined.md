Based on the provided information, all the commits relate to the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect offset used when accessing the PPPoE header within the `nf_flow_tuple_encap` function. The code incorrectly uses `skb_mac_header(skb)` to get the pointer to the PPPoE header, but the PPPoE header is located at the network header offset.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect offset calculation for PPPoE header
- Mismatch in flow table lookups for PPPoE packets

**Impact of exploitation:**
PPPoE packets will not match the flow table entries and will enter the classical forwarding path, potentially causing performance degradation and bypassing optimizations provided by the flow table.

**Attack vectors:**
Sending PPPoE traffic to an affected system will trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system using the affected netfilter flowtable implementation with PPPoE support.
