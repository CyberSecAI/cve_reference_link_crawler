streamlit-geospatial is a streamlit multipage app for geospatial applications. Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the palette variable in `pages/1_ðŸ“·_Timelapse.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 380, leading to remote code execution. Commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489 fixes this issue.
