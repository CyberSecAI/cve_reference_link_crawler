```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient size limitations within the `NotificationChannel` and `NotificationChannelGroup` components. Specifically, excessive data sizes in the `NotificationChannel` and `NotificationChannelGroup` can lead to an elevation of privilege.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Insufficient size limitation",
    "Elevation of privilege"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially elevate their privileges by exploiting the lack of size restrictions when creating or modifying notification channels and groups.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending excessively large data through the API related to `NotificationChannel` and `NotificationChannelGroup`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send data to the API that manages notification channels. No special execution privileges are required."
