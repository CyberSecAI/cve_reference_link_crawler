Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35088

**Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** Apache InLong
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.4.0 through 1.7.0

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `toAuditCkSql` method where the `groupId`, `streamId`, `auditId`, and `dt` parameters are directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This improper handling allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into an SQL query. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Malicious SQL commands could be used to modify or delete data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker might be able to use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the availability of the application or services through malicious SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `toAuditCkSql` method, where the vulnerable parameters are used to construct a SQL query.
*   An attacker would need to manipulate the `groupId`, `streamId`, `auditId`, or `dt` parameters in a way that injects malicious SQL code when the query is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint or method where the vulnerable SQL query is constructed.
*   The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
*   No authentication/authorization requirements were specified in this vulnerability description, but those might exist in the target environment, which would need to be overcome as well.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade:** Users should upgrade to Apache InLong version 1.8.0 or later, as it addresses this vulnerability.
*   **Patch:** Alternatively, users can apply the provided patch (cherry-pick) from the provided link:  <https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/8198>
*   **Input Sanitization:** Implement proper input validation and sanitization of parameters before they are used in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
*   **Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements with bound variables to avoid direct string concatenation in SQL queries.

This information provides a clear picture of the SQL injection vulnerability in Apache InLong.
