- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin generates export files with predictable filenames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive Data Disclosure due to predictable filenames for exported user data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can download the export files, gaining access to sensitive information such as usernames, IP addresses, and email addresses of users.
- **Attack vectors:** By guessing or knowing the predictable filename, an attacker can directly request the file via HTTP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication and can be in any network location.
