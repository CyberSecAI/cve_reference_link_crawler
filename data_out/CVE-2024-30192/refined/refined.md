- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts into the website through the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts through the plugin. The specific method of injection is not detailed in this document.  A contributor role is required for this vulnerability.
