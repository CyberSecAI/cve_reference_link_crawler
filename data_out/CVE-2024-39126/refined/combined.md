## [Reporting Security Issues](#id12)

Security issues with Roundup should be reported by email to:

> rouilj@users.sourceforge.net (John Rouillard)
>
> rsc@runtux.com (Ralf Schlatterbeck)

If these fail, you can find rouilj on irc in channel #roundup at
irc.oftc.net (see [Contact](https://www.roundup-tracker.org/contact.html) for more directions and web
interface). Methods listed at [Contact](https://www.roundup-tracker.org/contact.html) are all public, so they should
be used to contact somebody with the Roundup project for establishing
a proper method of reporting the security issue.

## [Verify Source Tarball](#id13)

If you download the source tarball using `python3 -m pip download
roundup` or from <https://pypi.org/project/roundup/#files> you can
verify the file using gpg.

This is the information on the public PGP/GPG key used to sign Roundup
distributions. It is used to sign the 1.6.0, 2.2.0, and newer
releases. (Note that the @ sign in email addresses have been replaced
with the word âatâ to reduce spam directed at the mailing list.):

```
Key info: Roundup Team (signing key for roundup releases)
    <roundup-devel at lists.sourceforge.net>
Expires: 2028-07-17
Key fingerprint = 411E 354B 5D1A F261 25D6  2122 1F2D D0CB 756A 76D8

```

Releases 1.6.1, 2.0.0 and 2.1.0 were accidentally signed with this key
[[1]](#id2):

```
Key info: John Rouillard (Roundup Release Key)
    <rouilj+roundup at ieee.org>
Expires: 2023-07-09
Key fingerprint =  A1E6 364E 9429 E9D8 2B3B 2373 DB05 ADC4 2330 5876

```

[[1](#id1)]

Use gpg to import this key from the keyserver pgp.mit.edu
if you need to verify one of these releases. Use the gpg
pgp.mit.edu keyserver example replacing the key fingerprint
with the one starting A1E6.

### [Importing the Public Key](#id14)

This only has to be added to your keyring once. You can import a key
from pgp.mit.edu using:

```
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --receive-keys 411E354B5D1AF26125D621221F2DD0CB756A76D8

```

where the fingerprint (without spaces) is used to identify which key
to receive. You can also extract and import the file
`tools/roundup.public.pgp.key` from the download source tarball
using:

```
tar -xzvf roundup-2.2.0.tar.gz -O \
   roundup-2.2.0/tools/roundup.public.pgp.key > pub.key

gpg --import pub.key

```

Once you have loaded the public key, you need a detached signature for
your release.

### [Download Detached Signature and Verify](#id15)

This needs to be done once for each release you wish to verify.

The Python Package Index (PyPI) used to support uploading gpg detached
signatures. However that is no longer supported and downloading
existing signatures may not work in the future.

As a result, the signatures for all Roundup final releases starting
with 1.6.0 have been moved and are linked below:

* [2.4.0](../signatures/roundup-2.4.0.tar.gz.asc)
* [2.4.0b2](../signatures/roundup-2.4.0b2.tar.gz.asc)
* [2.3.0](../signatures/roundup-2.3.0.tar.gz.asc)
* [2.3.0b2](../signatures/roundup-2.3.0b2.tar.gz.asc)
* [2.2.0](../signatures/roundup-2.2.0.tar.gz.asc)
* [2.1.0](../signatures/roundup-2.1.0.tar.gz.asc)
* [2.0.0](../signatures/roundup-2.0.0.tar.gz.asc)
* [1.6.1](../signatures/roundup-1.6.1.tar.gz.asc)
* [1.6.0](../signatures/roundup-1.6.0.tar.gz.asc)

To use the signature, download the correct versioned link and verify
it with (note 1.5.7 is a dummy version, use the correct version
number):

```
gpg --verify roundup-1.5.7.tar.gz.asc roundup-1.5.7.tar.gz

```

You should see:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed 13 Jul 2022 12:24:14 AM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key 411E354B5D1AF26125D621221F2DD0CB756A76D8
gpg: Good signature from "Roundup Team (signing key for roundup releases) <roundup-devel at lists.sourceforge.net>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 411E 354B 5D1A F261 25D6  2122 1F2D D0CB 756A 76D8

```

which verifies the tarball integrity. The WARNING is expected and the
date corresponds to the newest renewal of the Roundup key. As long as
you see the output starting with âGood signature fromâ followed by the
Key Info for your key, everything is OK.

If something is wrong you will see:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed 13 Jul 2022 12:24:14 AM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key 411E354B5D1AF26125D621221F2DD0CB756A76D8
gpg: BAD signature from "Roundup Team (signing key for roundup releases) <roundup-devel at lists.sourceforge.net>"

```

**do not use** the tarball if the signature is BAD. Email the mailing
list: roundup-devel at lists.sourceforge.net if you have this happen
to you.

[Build Status:
![Status of primary regression test job on github.](https://github.com/roundup-tracker/roundup/actions/workflows/ci-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/roundup-tracker/roundup/actions?query=workflow%3Aroundup-ci++)

Roundup is an issue-tracking system that boasts a user-friendly
interface and easy installation process. It offers a range of
interfaces, including command-line, web, REST, XML-RPC, and e-mail,
making it a versatile solution for issue tracking. The system is based
on the award-winning design by Ka-Ping Yee, which emerged victorious
in the Software Carpentry âTrackâ design competition.

Roundup is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the system to
their specific needs and preferences.

The latest stable version of Roundup is 2.4.0, which includes bug
fixes and additional features compared to the previous 2.3.0 release.

Roundup is compatible with Python 2.7.12+ or 3.6+.

Python 2 Support

Python 2 support ends with release 2.4.0 (July 2024).
Several Continuous Integration (CI) services are
discontinuing their resources for testing with Python 2.
Use Python 3 for the deployment of new trackers.
Existing trackers should be [upgraded to use Python 3.](docs/upgrading.html#python-3-support-info)

## Release Highlights

Some improvements from the 2.3.0 release are:

* three CVEâs have been fixed. One requires changes to your
  trackerâs home directory. The other two are fixed by
  installing 2.4.0. See
  <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/security.html> for
  details and instructions on how to fix these in 2.4.0 and
  earlier releases.
* new classhelper component thanks to a team of students
  from CS682 at U-Mass Boston. This fixes many issues with
  the old classhelper. It is implemented as a web-component
  and needs REST interface access. It will fall back to the
  classic classhelper if REST is not available or if the
  browser does not support web-components.
* fix Windows Python installation using pip. It used to go
  into an infinite loop during install or download. Also fix
  installation of shared files (templates) so roundup-admin
  can find them.
* using `@current_user` as a value in a search URL for a
  user property will use the current logged in user. Now you
  can share searches like: âMy issuesâ as âmyâ will become
  the current logged in user.
* login failures to the REST/XML-RPC interfaces are now rate
  limited to limit password guessing attacks.
* utf8mb4 is the default charset for MySQL. This requires
  migrating your database using the mysql client. You can
  choose to keep the older character set in config.ini.
* PostgreSQL services defined in pg\_service.conf can be
  used. PostgreSQL schemas are supported to eliminate the
  need for the roundup user to have database
  creation/deletion privileges.
* fix out of memory issue when importing larger trackers
  into PostgreSQL.
* multiple roundup-admin improvements: display protected
  properties (like creation date), better formatting of
  output, command history. Also on windows, pyreadline3 is
  supported to provide an editable interactive command line.
* an experimental wsgi performance improvement in 2.3.0 is
  now now the default and is opt-out.
* new template functions: utils.readfile and
  utils.expandfile. Javascript that is included in the
  Python core will be moved to external files and be able to
  have values from Roundup substituted in the Javascript.
* allow content-type of a template to be set from inside the
  template. This allows returning json or xml from a
  template without a .json or .xml extention.
* fix import/export on windows to use Unix style line
  endings fixing export/import on Windows and making exports
  portable across platforms.

More info on the 79 changes can be found in the [change notes](https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/tip/tree/CHANGES.txt).

## Roundup Use Cases

For more information on Roundup see the [features list](docs/features.html), [design overview](docs/design.html), and all the
other [documentation](docs.html). Roundup has been deployed for:

* bug tracking and TODO list management (the classic
  installation)
* customer help desk support (with a wizard for the phone
  answerers, linking to networking, system and development
  issue trackers)
* issue management for IETF working groups
* sales lead tracking
* conference paper submission and double-blind referee
  management
* weblogging (well, almost :)
* thing management using the [GTD methodology](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).

â¦and so on. Itâs been designed with [flexibility](docs/customizing.html) in mind - itâs not merely another bug
tracker.

## Try It Out

Roundup ships with a **demo tracker** to play with - you donât need to
install Roundup. After youâve unpacked the source, just run â`python
demo.py`â and load up the URL it prints out!

Follow the source gratification mode with these steps (change the
`-2.4.0` version identifier to match your downloaded file).

1. `python3 -m pip download roundup`
2. `tar -xzvf roundup-2.4.0.tar.gz`

   * if you donât have a tar command (e.g windows), use:

     ```
     python -c "import tarfile, sys; tarfile.open(sys.argv[1]).extractall();" roundup-2.4.0.tar.gz

     ```
3. `cd roundup-2.4.0`
4. `python3 demo.py`

(The source download can also be used to [create a custom Docker
image](docs/installation.html#docker-support).)

Alternatively, you can install using a virtual environment with pip
by:

1. create a virtual environment with:

   ```
   python3 -m venv roundup

   ```
2. activate the environment with (assuming your shell is
   sh/bash/zsh/ksh like):

   ```
   . roundup/bin/activate

   ```
3. install the latest release of Roundup with:

   ```
   python3 -m pip install roundup

   ```
4. create a demo tracker with:

   ```
   roundup-demo

   ```

   using `./demo` as the directory and the `classic` tracker.
5. load the URL printed by the demo tracker
6. when you are done, use deactivate to return your shell to using
   the system python.

Both of these methods produce the same result.

## Origin Story

Roundup was originally released as version 0.1.1 in late August, 2001.
The first [change note](https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/tip/tree/CHANGES.txt) written said:

> Needed a bug tracking system. Looked around. Tried to install many Perl-based systems, to no avail.
> Got tired of waiting for Roundup to be released. Had just finished major product project, so needed
> something different for a while. Roundup here I comeâ¦
