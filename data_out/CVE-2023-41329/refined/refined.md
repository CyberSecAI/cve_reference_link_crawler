- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition in the logic that validates domain names for proxying. The DNS server address might expire between the initial validation and the outbound network request, potentially allowing a request to go to a prohibited domain.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DNS rebinding vulnerability in WireMock's proxy mode when using domain names for network restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could bypass configured network restrictions, potentially accessing services that were intended to be blocked. The impact is considered low due to the requirement to control a DNS server and the limited scope of the vulnerability within the context of a testing tool.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires control over a DNS server and an environment where WireMock is used with network restrictions configured using domain names.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control the DNS server resolution for a domain name and be in a network position to make requests to the WireMock server.
