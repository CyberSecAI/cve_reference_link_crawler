Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of brute-force protection in the OAuth2 API controller of Nextcloud Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing brute-force protection: The OAuth2 API controller lacks mechanisms to prevent or limit repeated authentication attempts, allowing an attacker to try multiple client secrets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Client secret compromise: An attacker can potentially brute-force client secrets of configured OAuth2 clients. This could allow unauthorized access to the system and associated resources.
- Data Confidentiality: If an attacker gains unauthorized access, they may have access to data, though the impact on confidentiality is rated as low according to CVSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be performed remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the Nextcloud server is required.
- No special privileges or user interaction are needed for exploitation.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts).
- Patched versions are available for Nextcloud Server (25.0.9, 26.0.4, 27.0.1) and Nextcloud Enterprise Server (22.2.10.14, 23.0.12.9, 24.0.12.5, 25.0.9, 26.0.4, 27.0.1).
- No workarounds are available.
- The severity is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.8.
