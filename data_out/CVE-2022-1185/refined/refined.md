{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability in Ruby's regex engine can be triggered when compiling a specially crafted regex.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack buffer overflow in the Ruby regex engine, and insecure use of `eval` within the RDoc parser.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS). A malicious RDoc file can crash Puma, causing GitLab to become unavailable.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a specific regular expression within an RDoc file and uploading it to a GitLab instance. When a user tries to view the rendered version of the file, the vulnerability is triggered.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must have the ability to create or modify files within a GitLab repository. They can be a low-privileged user with the ability to commit code."
