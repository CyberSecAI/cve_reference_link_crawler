Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input sanitization in the `insertClient.php` file. Specifically, the `name` parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). User supplied data is not sanitized before being output on the `Client.php` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `name` parameter, which is then stored in the database and executed when the client information is displayed on the `Client.php` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim (e.g., changing user details, submitting forms, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts an HTTP POST request to `insertClient.php`, injecting the malicious JavaScript code within the `name` parameter. The crafted payload is then stored in the database and displayed on the client page when a user views the information.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `name` parameter in the `insertClient.php` script is the specific entry point for the XSS attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send the crafted HTTP POST request.
- **Understanding of the application:** The attacker needs to know how the vulnerable parameter in the application works and that the user-controlled data is displayed without sanitization.
- **No authentication requirements** are explicitly mentioned in this exploit writeup.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses the following payload: `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`
- The vulnerable code is present in the `insertClient.php` file within the Life Insurance Management System v1.0. The data is then displayed on `Client.php`
- The attacker uses a multipart form-data request to inject the payload via the `name` parameter, as seen in the provided Burp Suite Request.
- The vulnerable application is identified as `AEGON LIFE v1.0 Life Insurance Management System` from `projectworlds.in`.
