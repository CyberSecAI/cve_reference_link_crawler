Hey Inkdroppers,

I’m excited to announce that Inkdrop v5.6.0 is out!

There are a lot of improvements in this release. Please enjoy ![:star_struck:](https://forum.inkdrop.app/images/emoji/twitter/star_struck.png?v=12 ":star_struck:")

## :dash: Faster launch speed

Managed to make it 500-700ms faster ![:rocket:](https://forum.inkdrop.app/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:")

Here is a demo:

![file_Gs-9UL_8u](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0c3f975cfc231e951ba923fc4d86c959cd116295.gif)

**![:writing_hand:](https://forum.inkdrop.app/images/emoji/twitter/writing_hand.png?v=12 ":writing_hand:") STORY**: [How I made Inkdrop 500ms faster to launch🚀](https://www.devas.life/how-i-made-inkdrop-500ms-faster-to-launch/)

### Loading plugins lazily

Along with v5.6.0, some plugins have been updated with performance improvements as well. [mermaid](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/mermaid) and [math](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/math) load their modules only when you open a note that uses one of them. It would keep the launch speed fast even if you installed plugins that require massive modules like them.

## :art: Markdown renderer engine update

v5.6.0 has upgraded Remark and Rehype packages to the latest versions. It isn’t only an internal improvement but also gives you more possibilities to get useful features. It now has `mdast` and `hast` data in [the preview state](https://developers.inkdrop.app/states/preview), which allows to add syntax-aware features like outline views more easily without relying on regular expressions.

**![:writing_hand:](https://forum.inkdrop.app/images/emoji/twitter/writing_hand.png?v=12 ":writing_hand:") STORY**: [Refactoring the extensible Markdown renderer ![:hammer_and_wrench:](https://forum.inkdrop.app/images/emoji/twitter/hammer_and_wrench.png?v=12 ":hammer_and_wrench:")](https://www.devas.life/refactoring-the-extensible-markdown-renderer/)

On the other hand, it may cause some plugins not working due to the breaking changes. For plugin developers, I’ll post another topic to help you update your plugins.

## :rainbow: Built-in paste-as-markdown support

Plugins are useful but it’d be a burden to explore and decide which plugins to install for light users. I wanted to make the app just work out of the box. As a starter, `paste-as-markdown` is now bundled into the app by default. It allows you to paste HTML as Markdown from the clipboard. It’d be useful for copy-and-pasting formatted texts from browsers.

I’m planning to bundle **Mermaid**, **GitHub Emoji**, and **Math** plugins as well.

## :dizzy_face: Acrylic window style is not working on Windows

* [Lag when resizing the window with Acrylic background](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/lag-when-resizing-the-window-with-acrylic-background/4011)

On Electron@25.1.1, the module that the app used to support the acrylic window style no longer works, unfortunately. The good news is that Electron itself officially supports the acrylic style for Windows:

* [feat: support Mica/Acrylic on Windows by codebytere · Pull Request #38163 · electron/electron · GitHub](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/38163)

The bad news is that it is not stable and working as expected – It doesn’t work with frameless windows, besides, it becomes unresizable and loses shadows. So, unfortunately, the acrylic window style is not supported on Windows in this release.

## :sparkles: Nested workspace views

In previous versions, pressing the “Detail” button on the notebook would take you to the workspace view, but you couldn’t press the “Detail” button again once you were in that view.

In this update, the “Detail” button is now functional within the workspace view as well!

[![nested workspace view](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/7/70deb1d54021785330b8ff881f949ac253e9c37a.jpeg)nested workspace view986×676 51 KB](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/7/70deb1d54021785330b8ff881f949ac253e9c37a.jpeg "nested workspace view")

The sidebar now displays the path of the current and parent notebooks:

## Quick notebook picker for moving notes

You can more quickly choose a notebook ![:smiley:](https://forum.inkdrop.app/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12 ":smiley:")

## :sparkles: New API documentation (WIP)

[![Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 15.01.06](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0943082b92e0bea0fe4ccb3278fc3310986adfa4_2_690x439.jpeg)Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 15.01.061380×878 125 KB](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0943082b92e0bea0fe4ccb3278fc3310986adfa4.jpeg "Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 15.01.06")

I’ve been working on redesigning the documentation and the new API documentation is now available as WIP.

### [API Documentation - Inkdrop](https://developers.inkdrop.app/)

Explore the comprehensive Inkdrop API documentation to customize, enhance, and tailor the app's functionalities. From JavaScript tweaks to UI style adjustments, unlock the full potential of Inkdrop.

The design is heavily inspired by Stripe, built on top of Tailwind UI. It supports full-text search now. There are still many missing pages and broken links though, your help to improve the doc would be greatly appreciated. It will be more comprehensive and easy to understand and I hope you like it ![:smiley:](https://forum.inkdrop.app/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12 ":smiley:")

I’ll be working on creating a new user manual as well!
