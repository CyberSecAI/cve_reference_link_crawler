You can simply remove this file from your package.  To be more precise: The file com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.policy can be removed from the package.  The other two policy files are still used. I already looked at the usb-device-formatter. The dde-file-manager is just for executing the file-manager as root. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1134131#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-10 11:52:27 UTC  ``` So the action com.deepin.pkexec.dde-file-manager is kind of okay. The com.deepin.pkexec.usb-device-formatter.policy, however, is not. It allows locally logged in regular users to run /usr/bin/usb-device-formatter without any authentication.  The usb-device-formatter has the following issues:  - it crashes when called without parameters - It can be used to determine the existence of arbitrary files, since all   paths can be passed and the error message differentiates between not   existing and not a block device. - The "removable device" detection isn't working, because it looks for   "rm":"1" in lsblk's JSON output, however the output contains "rm":true. This   was only recently changed in util-linux v2.33. - When operating on a symlinked block device the application allows to unmount   arbitrary block devices as far as they're not busy. - The same symlink attack can be used to format arbitrary file systems as long   as they're not busy. - it reads from users `~/.pam_environment` w/o any protection. It looks like   other PAM applications do that as well. Linking /dev/zero there causes fun   things. This should only be done after dropping privilege to the calling   user and by now following symlinks.  So this program is certainly not fit to be run without root authentication. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1134131#c8)  Yanhao Mo   2019-06-18 03:22:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1134131#c7)) > So the action com.deepin.pkexec.dde-file-manager is kind of okay.

Hi，I am a employee of deepin, and thanks for pointing out this issues.

True, this bug depends on the other one. Since you're from deepin, maybe you can also have a look at [bug 1136026](show_bug.cgi?id=1136026 "NEW - AUDIT-0: deepin-anything: new d-bus service") and our statement there. We've invested quite some resources in reviewing deepin code but this seems to have no end. A different security culture needs to be established to make this work for both sides. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1134131#c11)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-07-03 11:07:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to moyanhao@deepin.com from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1134131#c8)) > <https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-file-manager/pull/195> requiring authorization before take actions.

Hmm the check `!path.startsWith("/dev/")` is not good style. You need to stat() the file and check the file type. You should also make sure the path is not a symlink (by using O_NOFOLLOW). A sequence like  int fd = open(path, O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW); struct stat s; fstat(fd, &s); if( ! (s.st_mode & S_IFBLK) || s.st_uid != 0) { 	// fail }  would be needed. Don't know right away how to achieve that best with Qt API, it is not well designed for security, sadly.  You can additionally keep the check for the /dev prefix but before checking for that prefix you should normalize the path, otherwise the user can simply specify something like /dev/../root/.bashrc.  > <https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-file-manager/pull/196> compatibility with new format of lsblk output   Okay this should work.  > <https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-file-manager/pull/190> don't read .pam_enviroment any more  Good. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1134131#c12)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-16 12:40:52 UTC  ``` There has been no response from the packager or from upstream for a long time.
