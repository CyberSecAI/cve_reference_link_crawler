## Description

![@hillwoodroc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1880237?v=4&size=48)[hillwoodroc](https://github.com/hillwoodroc)opened [on Jul 26, 2024](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/developer-center/issues/10007#issue-2432139876)
### SUMMARY | 问题概要

This dde-file-manager-daemon is a security nightmare! None of the D-Bus methods it exports are protected by polkit so just any user can call them. While this is not generally a problem it *is* a problem here, because the exported methods allow a bunch of privileged operations to everybody.

### SOFTWARE/OS VERSIONS | 软件/系统版本信息

```
6.0.54 and before

```
### PRE-REQUIREMENT | 预置条件

*No response*

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE | 复现步骤

From <https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1134132>

in the D-Bus configuration file com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.conf we find the following:

```
<!-- Only root can own the service -->
<policy user="root">
  <allow own="com.deepin.filemanager.daemon"/>
</policy>

<!-- Allow anyone to invoke methods on the interfaces -->
<policy context="default">
  <allow own="com.deepin.filemanager.daemon"/>

```

There are two "own=" lines one for root and one for everybody else. This allows any user to register this daemon (or actually: any program) on the D-Bus system bus. It allows to hijack other users' D-Bus connections. This is especially bad since for example in the method `setUserSharePassword` cleartext passwords are passed.

setUserSharePassword: allows to set arbitrary users' smd password. Changes the database in /var/lib/samba/private. If at all then this must only be allowed for the caller's username. This is now Polkit authenticated. The name is still passed unfiltered to`smbpasswd`, though. It could be a command line parameter "--evil". This should be filtered.

Newly added D-Bus methods:

* com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.MountControl.Mount: allows to mount file

  systems, not Polkit authenticated. There is support for "common" file

  systems, which is not implemented though. Then there's "cifs" which allows

  pretty much freedom about passing strings to "mkdir()" and to "mount()",

  creates directories with user controlled data in /media//samba. In

  principle allows "../" elements in paths, only the `mkdir()` luckily fails

  to follow them. Then there's a "dlnfs" file system plugin which looks for a

  "dlnfs" program before continuing. I couldn't find out what program this is

  supposed to be. It's not packaged on openSUSE anyway. A user controlled path

  is passed as command line argument to this program, which might allow

  privilege escalation, but I cannot say for sure, since I don't know the program.
* com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.MountControl.Unmount: allows to unmount some

  file systems. The plugins that deal with this use libmount mtab for finding

  out about already existing mounts. This could be tricked by users that are

  allowed to mount FUSE based file systems. They can choose arbitrary strings

  as "source device" that might confuse the logic in the plugins.
* com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.UserShareManager.CloseSmbShareByShareName:

  this tries to unmount a share via "smbcontrol smbd close-share %1", where %1

  is a user controlled string. There is no Polkit authentication. There are

  some checks that the resulting path is not a symlink or an escape out of

  /var/lib/samba/usershares. If somebody managed to mount a samba share under

  a weird name like "myshare --extra-parameter=this", then the

  resulting QProcess execution of smbcontrol might result in side effects.
* com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.UserShareManager.EnableSmbServices:

  allow to enable smbd and nmbd without authentication. This must be

  authenticated.
* com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.AccessControlManager:

  + SetAccessPolicy(): uses an unsafe utils::isValidInvoker() helper function

    that checks the callers /proc/%1/exe. This is a racy check that can we

    circumvented by unprivileged callers by replacing their process with one

    of the whitelisted ones.
  + SetVaultAccessPolicy(): use the same unsafe check
  + Chmod(): Allows to change the mode of arbitrary paths. Luckily Polkit

    authenticated. But there is a file existence check issue in there. If the

    file doesn't exist, then the call exists early without authenticating.

    Thus a caller can determine whether certain files exist or not, by

    observing whether Polkit authentication requests are sent out or not.

Overall this service still isn't fit for inclusion for a lot of reasons.

Most if not all of the D-Bus methods need to Polkit authenticated (they can

have a 'yes' setting for active users, if the methods don't allow highly

privileged things. But nobody & friends should not be allowed to call all

these methods.

Other shaky authentication tests should be dropped like this

utils::isValidInvoker().

The D-Bus configuration "own" line still needs to be fixed.

You can simply remove this file from your package.  To be more precise: The file com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.policy can be removed from the package.  The other two policy files are still used. I already looked at the usb-device-formatter. The dde-file-manager is just for executing the file-manager as root. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1134131#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-10 11:52:27 UTC  ``` So the action com.deepin.pkexec.dde-file-manager is kind of okay. The com.deepin.pkexec.usb-device-formatter.policy, however, is not. It allows locally logged in regular users to run /usr/bin/usb-device-formatter without any authentication.  The usb-device-formatter has the following issues:  - it crashes when called without parameters - It can be used to determine the existence of arbitrary files, since all   paths can be passed and the error message differentiates between not   existing and not a block device. - The "removable device" detection isn't working, because it looks for   "rm":"1" in lsblk's JSON output, however the output contains "rm":true. This   was only recently changed in util-linux v2.33. - When operating on a symlinked block device the application allows to unmount   arbitrary block devices as far as they're not busy. - The same symlink attack can be used to format arbitrary file systems as long   as they're not busy. - it reads from users `~/.pam_environment` w/o any protection.

Hi，I am a employee of deepin, and thanks for pointing out this issues.

True, this bug depends on the other one. Since you're from deepin, maybe you can also have a look at [bug 1136026](show_bug.cgi?id=1136026 "NEW - AUDIT-0: deepin-anything: new d-bus service") and our statement there. We've invested quite some resources in reviewing deepin code but this seems to have no end.

Hmm the check `!path.startsWith("/dev/")` is not good style. You need to stat() the file and check the file type. You should also make sure the path is not a symlink (by using O_NOFOLLOW).

This review is related to [bug 1134131](show_bug.cgi?id=1134131 "REOPENED - AUDIT-0: deepin-file-manager: new polkit actions of deepin-file-manager") (polkit actions). ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1134132#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-10 11:45:40 UTC  ``` This dde-file-manager-daemon is a security nightmare! None of the D-Bus methods it exports are protected by polkit so just any user can call them. While this is not generally a problem it *is* a problem here, because the exported methods allow a bunch of privileged operations to everybody.  Findings about the daemon in general:  - in the D-Bus configuration file com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.conf we find   the following:    ```   <!-- Only root can own the service -->   <policy user="root">     <allow own="com.deepin.filemanager.daemon"/>   </policy>    <!-- Allow anyone to invoke methods on the interfaces -->   <policy context="default">     <allow own="com.deepin.filemanager.daemon"/>   ```    There are two "own=" lines one for root and one for everybody else. This   allows any user to register this daemon (or actually: any program) on the   D-Bus system bus. It allows to hijack other users' D-Bus connections. This   is especially bad since for example in the method `setUserSharePassword`   cleartext passwords are passed.  - the daemon creates a log file in `/var/cache/deepin/dde-file-manager-daemon`.   First of all this is not the right place for a log file. Log files belong to   /var/log or /var/lib at best. Furthermore the log file is world readable   which should be avoided for logs originating from privileged programs.  - the checkAuthorization() call (which is unused actually at the moment) uses   the deprecated polkit UnixProcessSubject with PIDs again. Like in the other   Deepin programs this needs to be changed to use the D-Bus SystemBusName   subject.  Findings in the UserShareManager interface:  - setUserSharePassword: allows to set arbitrary users' smd password. Changes   the database in /var/lib/samba/private. If at all then this must only be   allowed for the caller's username. - addGroup: calls `groupadd` so regular users can create arbitrary groups. Not   acceptable. Not acceptable interface without admin protection. - addUserToGroup: allows arbitrary users to add arbitrary other users to   arbitrary other groups. Luckily doesn't work on SUSE, because   `/usr/sbin/adduser` is called but we have `useradd`. Not acceptable   interface without admin-protection. - restartSambaService calls `smbd restart`, shouldn't this go out to systemd   instead? Must also be authenticated.  Findings in the TagManagerDaemon:  - disposeClientData: manages some tags for files that are stored in a per   filesystem SQLite database. Doesn't look trustworthy. Why should everybody   be able to fiddle with tags?  Findings in UsbFormatter:  - mkfs: create jfs, ext2/3/4, btrfs, swap, hfs, dosfs, xfs, reiserfs on   arbitrary paths. This can overwrite arbitrary regular files, too, if they   are large enough. Not acceptable interface without admin-authentication.  Findings in DeviceInfoManager:  The methods in this interface are somehwat okay but they still allow to call lsblk and various low level file system information tools on arbitrary block devices or other paths.  Summary -------  In its current state the dde-file-manager-daemon cannot be accepted into openSUSE. It needs major security overhaul. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1134132#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-16 12:39:23 UTC  ``` There has been no response from the package or from upstream for a long time.

It is about the same basic software and mechanisms.  So the D-Bus interface in this package changed quite a bit. There is also *some* authentication in there for some D-Bus methods now. However the authentication is buggy:  1) PolicyKitHelper::checkAuthorization uses the UnixProcessSubject which is    racy. PIDs can change at any time. The SytemBusName polkit subject needs to    be used to make this proper.  2) Similarly in AccessControlManager the methods SetAccessPolicy and    SetVaultAccessPolicy uses the callers PID to check against a whitelist of    process names. This is also racy, the caller can replace its own process by a    different one that matches the expectations of this check.  RevocationManager: it is unclear what this is used for, but anybody can call pushEvent, popEvent without authentication. This can DoS memory but also cause something else, whatever popEvent() means for the deepin environment.  TagManagerDaemon::disposeClientData: this method changes a sqlite database and is unauthenticated. Doesn't look trustworthy.  VaultManager interface:  - sysUserChanged is unauthenticated, causes a heap allocation. - checkAuthentication method has an unclear use (why expose an authentication   method on D-Bus?) but it also uses the UnixProcessSubject, so it's racy - all other methods are also unauthenticated  VaultManager2 interface:  - VaultBruteForcePrevention::isValidInvoker() always returns true, thus   all methods are unauthenticated  UserShareManager interface:  - UnmountSambaShare tries to determine whether the target path is controlled   by the caller's UID. This method allows to accesses arbitrary paths, also   symlinks, which is racy. For example passing ../../../../home/myusername   allows to escape the destined directory. Also the share name can contain   '--' as prefix and would thus in theory allow to pass arbitrary arguments to   the smbcontrol invocation:    ```   QString cmd = QString("smbcontrol smbd close-share %1").arg(sharename);     qDebug() << "cmd==========" << cmd;     p.start(cmd);   ```    I'm not completely sure how QProcess::start() behaves here, but it could   even be possible to inject multiple parameters or shell syntax here.  So all in all things have not really improved a lot here. This still cannot be accepted. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1134132#c12)  Hillwood Yang   2023-11-22 06:13:37 UTC  ``` Hi.

Something seems to have changed here, but the UnixProcessSubject is still used here:      src/plugins/filemanager/dfmplugin-vault/views/vaultremovepages.cpp: UnixProcessSubject(getpid()),     src/plugins/filemanager/dfmplugin-vault/views/createvaultview/vaultactivefinishedview.cpp: UnixProcessSubject(getpid()),     src/plugins/filemanager/dfmplugin-vault/views/unlockview/retrievepasswordview.cpp: UnixProcessSubject(getpid()),  In these locations the code asks Polkit whether the process itself (`getpid()`) is authorized to perform an action. What kind of sense is that supposed to make? Either the process runs as root, i.e. it will always be authenticated. Or the process runs in the user's context, then it doesn't matter what Polkit says, the action can always be carried out.  > Findings in the UserShareManager interface: >  > - setUserSharePassword: allows to set arbitrary users' smd password.

This no longer seems to exist.  Newly added D-Bus methods:  - com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.MountControl.Mount: allows to mount file   systems, not Polkit authenticated. There is support for "common" file   systems, which is not implemented though. Then there's "cifs" which allows   pretty much freedom about passing strings to "mkdir()" and to "mount()",   creates directories with user controlled data in /media/<username>/samba. In   principle allows "../" elements in paths, only the `mkdir()` luckily fails   to follow them. Then there's a "dlnfs" file system plugin which looks for a   "dlnfs" program before continuing. I couldn't find out what program this is   supposed to be. It's not packaged on openSUSE anyway. A user controlled path   is passed as command line argument to this program, which might allow   privilege escalation, but I cannot say for sure, since I don't know the program.  - com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.MountControl.Unmount: allows to unmount some   file systems. The plugins that deal with this use libmount mtab for finding   out about already existing mounts. This could be tricked by users that are   allowed to mount FUSE based file systems. They can choose arbitrary strings   as "source device" that might confuse the logic in the plugins.  - com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.UserShareManager.CloseSmbShareByShareName:   this tries to unmount a share via "smbcontrol smbd close-share %1", where %1   is a user controlled string. There is no Polkit authentication. There are   some checks that the resulting path is not a symlink or an escape out of   /var/lib/samba/usershares. If somebody managed to mount a samba share under   a weird name like "myshare --extra-parameter=this", then the   resulting QProcess execution of smbcontrol might result in side effects.  - com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.UserShareManager.EnableSmbServices:   allow to enable smbd and nmbd without authentication. This must be   authenticated.  - com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.AccessControlManager:    + SetAccessPolicy(): uses an unsafe utils::isValidInvoker() helper function     that checks the callers /proc/%1/exe. This is a racy check that can we     circumvented by unprivileged callers by replacing their process with one     of the whitelisted ones.   + SetVaultAccessPolicy(): use the same unsafe check   + Chmod(): Allows to change the mode of arbitrary paths. Luckily Polkit     authenticated. But there is a file existence check issue in there. If the     file doesn't exist, then the call exists early without authenticating.     Thus a caller can determine whether certain files exist or not, by     observing whether Polkit authentication requests are sent out or not.  Overall this service still isn't fit for inclusion for a lot of reasons.  Most if not all of the D-Bus methods need to Polkit authenticated (they can have a 'yes' setting for active users, if the methods don't allow highly privileged things. But nobody & friends should not be allowed to call all these methods.  Other shaky authentication tests should be dropped like this utils::isValidInvoker().  The D-Bus configuration "own" line still needs to be fixed. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1134132#c19)  Hillwood Yang   2024-07-27 07:39:25 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1228364](show_bug.cgi?id=1228364 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - VUL-0: CVE-2023-50700: deepin-file-manager: privileged operations can be called by unprivileged users via the D-Bus method") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |
