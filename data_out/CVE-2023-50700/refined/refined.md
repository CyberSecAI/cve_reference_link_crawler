Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security issues related to CVE-2023-50700, which is a duplicate of Bug 1134132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue is that the `dde-file-manager-daemon` exposes numerous D-Bus methods that perform privileged operations without proper authentication. This allows any user on the system to call these methods, potentially leading to privilege escalation and other security problems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unprotected D-Bus Methods:** Many D-Bus methods are not protected by Polkit, allowing any user to invoke them.
    *   `setUserSharePassword`: Allows setting arbitrary users' Samba passwords.
    *   `Mount`: Allows mounting file systems with user-controlled parameters.
    *   `Unmount`: Allows unmounting file systems, potentially trickable with FUSE mounts.
    *   `CloseSmbShareByShareName`: Allows unmounting Samba shares via `smbcontrol` with user-controlled share names.
    *   `EnableSmbServices`: Allows enabling `smbd` and `nmbd` services without authentication.
*   **Insecure D-Bus Configuration:** The D-Bus configuration allows any user to register the daemon, enabling hijacking of other users' D-Bus connections.
*  **Racy Authentication Checks:**
    *   `SetAccessPolicy()` and `SetVaultAccessPolicy()`: use an unsafe `utils::isValidInvoker()` helper function that checks the caller's `/proc/%1/exe`. This is racy and can be circumvented.
*   **Command Injection Vulnerability:**
     * The `CloseSmbShareByShareName` method uses string formatting to construct an `smbcontrol` command, potentially allowing command injection through the share name.
*  **File Existence Check Issue:**
    *  The `Chmod()` method allows determining the existence of files due to early exits without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Unprivileged users can perform actions that should be restricted to root, such as mounting file systems, modifying user passwords, and managing Samba shares.
*   **Data Modification:** Arbitrary modification of user's Samba passwords and potentially file system modifications,
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The unauthenticated `pushEvent` and `popEvent` calls in the `RevocationManager` could cause memory exhaustion.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The ability to check for file existence via `Chmod` can leak sensitive information about the system.
*  **Command Injection:** Exploiting the command injection vulnerability in `CloseSmbShareByShareName` could allow execution of arbitrary commands.
*   **System Instability:** Incorrect usage of methods like `Unmount` could lead to system instability by messing with the mount table.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local D-Bus Communication:** Exploiting the unprotected D-Bus methods is done through local D-Bus communication.
*   **Hijacking D-Bus Service:** By taking advantage of the insecure D-Bus configuration, any user can register the service, preventing the legitimate service from running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a local user account on the system where the vulnerable `dde-file-manager-daemon` is running.
*   The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the D-Bus system bus.

**Additional Details**

* The vulnerability is present in `deepin-file-manager` versions 6.0.54 and before.
* The D-Bus configuration file `com.deepin.filemanager.daemon.conf` has insecure policies allowing any user to own and call methods on the service.
