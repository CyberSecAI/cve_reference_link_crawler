- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a reliance on untrusted inputs within the Gallagher Diagnostics Service. This allows a privileged user to configure the service to utilize less secure communication protocols.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the insufficient validation or sanitization of user-supplied input which influences the security configuration of the Diagnostics Service. This leads to the service potentially using less secure communication methods than intended.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could result in a less secure communication setup, potentially exposing sensitive data transmitted through the Diagnostics Service. While the impact is not categorized as high, it does allow an attacker to compromise communication security (Integrity) and potentially expose data (Confidentiality).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a privileged user manipulating the configuration of the Diagnostics Service through untrusted inputs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user to modify the service's configuration.
