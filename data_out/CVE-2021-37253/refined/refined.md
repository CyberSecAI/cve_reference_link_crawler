  "CVE-2021-37253": {
    "Description": "M-Files Web before 20.10.9524.1 allows a denial of service via overlapping ranges (in HTTP requests with crafted Range or Request-Range headers). NOTE: this is disputed because the range behavior is the responsibility of the web server, not the responsibility of the individual web application",
    "Root cause": "Improper processing of Range headers with overlapping ranges in HTTP requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The web application fails to handle overlapping range requests properly.",
       "The application attempts to compress each of the requested bytes, leading to excessive resource consumption."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory and CPU consumption, which can cause the web application to crash and become unavailable.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted HTTP requests with overlapping ranges in the Range or Request-Range headers.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. Authentication is not required. The attack is easily reproducible."
  }
