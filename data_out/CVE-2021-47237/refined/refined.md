Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2021-47237.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing `free_netdev()` call in the `mkiss_close()` function within the Linux kernel's hamradio networking driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak. When the mkiss interface is closed, the associated network device is unregistered but not deallocated, resulting in memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a memory leak that could potentially lead to denial of service. Repeated opening and closing of the mkiss interface without proper cleanup will cause the system to slowly exhaust available memory.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `mkiss_open()` and `mkiss_close()` functions called via the tty layer and ioctl syscall.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to open and close the mkiss interface. This can be done by an unprivileged user if the `CONFIG_HAMRADIO` kernel configuration is enabled.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content contains multiple commits that address the same vulnerability. The commits all add the missing `free_netdev(ax->dev);` to the `mkiss_close` function in `drivers/net/hamradio/mkiss.c`. The commits also contain a detailed syzbot fail log that provides the call trace and memory dump details demonstrating the memory leak.
