Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a security misconfiguration in the `auth-server` component of the `open-capacity-platform` (OCP). Specifically, the actuator endpoints are not properly secured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exposed Actuator Endpoints:** The application exposes all actuator endpoints, including sensitive ones like `/heapdump`, without any authentication or authorization checks.
- **Information Disclosure:** The exposed actuator endpoints, such as `/heapdump`, can reveal sensitive information about the application's internal state, memory, and configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information, including application internals, memory dumps, and configuration details, which could be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `auth-server` component.
- **Direct Endpoint Access:** The attacker can directly access the exposed actuator endpoints (e.g., `/actuator/heapdump`) via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable `auth-server` component.
- No prior authentication or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects version 2.0.1 of the `open-capacity-platform` (OCP).
- The `bootstrap.yml` configuration file is the source of the issue, as it allows all actuator endpoints to be exposed.
- The provided POC is simply accessing `/actuator/heapdump` which will provide a heap dump of the application.

This information is consistent with the CVE description, which indicates a security misconfiguration in the OCP's `auth-server` component allowing access to actuator endpoints, leading to potential information disclosure.
