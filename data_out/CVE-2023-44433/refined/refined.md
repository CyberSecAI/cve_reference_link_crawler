{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer when handling Annotation objects.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file with specially crafted Annotation objects or host a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required for successful exploitation."
