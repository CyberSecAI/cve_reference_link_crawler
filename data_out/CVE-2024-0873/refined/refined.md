Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0873

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the `watu-basic-chart` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input in the shortcode attributes, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. This code executes when a user accesses the affected page.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** Once the attacker can execute Javascript they can perform a number of malicious actions such as:
    - Redirecting users to phishing pages.
    - Stealing session cookies and hijacking user accounts.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject malicious scripts by crafting a `watu-basic-chart` shortcode with malicious attributes and adding it to a WordPress post or page.
- **User-Supplied Attributes:** The vulnerability lies in the plugin's failure to properly handle user input within the shortcode attributes (e.g., `your_color`, `avg_color`, `your_percent_text`, etc.).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level permissions to be able to add shortcodes to content.
- **Content Creation:** The attacker must be able to create or edit posts or pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The malicious script executes automatically when a user views the injected page.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Plugin:** Watu Quiz
- **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 3.4.1
- **Patched Version:** 3.4.1.1
- The patch implemented input sanitization using `esc_attr()` on the shortcode attributes that were vulnerable to XSS.
