The provided content relates to a fix for a connection leak in the Linux kernel's SMC (Shared Memory Communications) module, specifically addressing a scenario where `tcp_abort()` could lead to a connection being stuck.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A connection leak occurs in the SMC module due to how the connection closing process interacts with `tcp_abort()`.
- When a connection is being established, `tcp_abort()` might discard CLC CONFIRM messages that are in the TCP send buffer.
- If the CLC CONFIRM message is discarded, the server-side of the connection never receives the connection token, and thus cannot send a passive close message.
- This leaves the connection in a state where it cannot be properly disconnected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incomplete or incorrect connection closing logic in `smc_release` function when combined with `tcp_abort()`.
- The issue arises specifically when the socket is in the `SMC_INIT` state and then transitions to `SMC_ACTIVE` after a `tcp_abort()`.
- Missing handling of the case where the CLC Confirm message is lost.
- Failure to properly close the SMC connection when the server does not receive CLC CONFIRM messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A connection leak could occur.
- A connection would remain open indefinitely, consuming resources.
- In scenarios with multiple leaks this could lead to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a connection attempt fails or is aborted.
- Specifically, the sequence is `smc_release` -> `smc_connect_work` -> `tcp_abort()` -> state becomes `SMC_ACTIVE`.
- An attacker could potentially trigger this behavior by forcing the connection to abort using non-blocking connect.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the SMC socket and cause a connection attempt to be aborted with `tcp_abort()`, before the connection completes.
- The attacker must be able to cause `smc_connect_work` to be called, resulting in `tcp_abort()`, prior to the connection state moving past `SMC_INIT`.

The fix ensures that if the socket's state changes to `SMC_ACTIVE` after a `tcp_abort()` and it was previously `SMC_INIT`, the connection is actively aborted using `smc_close_active_abort()` to avoid a resource leak.
