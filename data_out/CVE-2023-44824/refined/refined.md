Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of filtering on uploaded files within the Expense Management System. This allows an attacker to upload malicious files that the system will then execute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system does not validate or sanitize uploaded files, specifically during user registration when uploading an avatar picture.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): The ability to upload arbitrary files enables an attacker to execute malicious code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full server compromise: An attacker can potentially delete, rewrite, or modify server resources.
- Full Control:  Achieving the "purpose of the attack" indicates the potential for complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- File upload functionality: Specifically the avatar picture upload during registration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User account creation: The attacker needs to register an account to utilize the avatar picture upload functionality.
- Ability to craft malicious code: The attacker needs to prepare a malicious file (e.g., a script, executable, etc) that will be executed upon upload.
