### Summary of Vulnerability Information for CVE-2024-6930

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `bookingform` shortcode of the WP Booking Calendar plugin. Specifically, the `type` attribute is vulnerable.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when a page containing the vulnerable shortcode is accessed.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users who visit the page containing the vulnerable shortcode.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `bookingform` shortcode, specifically by exploiting the `type` attribute.
- An attacker crafts a malicious `bookingform` shortcode containing a JavaScript payload within the `type` attribute.
- This shortcode is then added to a page or post on the WordPress site.
- When a user (including administrators) views the page containing the malicious shortcode, the injected script executes.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs at least Contributor-level access to a WordPress site to be able to inject the malicious shortcode content.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Plugin**: WP Booking Calendar
*   **Affected Versions**: Versions <= 10.2.1
*   **Patched Version**: 10.2.2 and later
*   **CVSS Score**: 6.4 (Medium)
*   **Researcher**: Arkadiusz Hydzik of Wordfence
*   **Fix**: The vulnerability was fixed in version 10.2.2 by implementing proper sanitization and output escaping.

**Technical Details from the Code:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `wpdev-booking-class.php` file, specifically in the `bookingform_shortcode` function, which is used when the `bookingform` shortcode is parsed.
*   The code directly uses the attribute values without sanitizing them when rendering HTML.
