Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-47314.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory leak in the `fsl_ifc` driver. Specifically, when the driver's probe function fails, the allocated memory for the private structure `fsl_ifc_ctrl_dev` is not released, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak, which occurs when the driver fails to initialize during the probe stage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a memory leak. Repeated probe failures could lead to the exhaustion of available memory resources, potentially causing system instability or denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is triggering a failure during the probe of the `fsl_ifc` driver. This could potentially be achieved by supplying invalid configuration or if the hardware is not operating correctly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have the capability to influence the probe process of the `fsl_ifc` driver, either through system configuration or by triggering hardware failures. This could involve physical access to the device or the ability to modify the device tree configuration.

The fix involves replacing the usage of `kzalloc` with `devm_kzalloc`. `devm_kzalloc` is a resource-managed allocation, that automatically releases allocated memory when the device is removed or when the driver probe fails. This ensures that the memory allocated for the private structure is always freed, resolving the memory leak.
