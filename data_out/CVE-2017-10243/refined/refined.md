Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2017-10243:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- **Insecure XML parsing:** The vulnerability stems from insecure XML parsing within the `wsdlimport` tool of the JAX-WS component in OpenJDK. This tool is used for parsing WSDL (Web Services Description Language) documents, which are used to describe web services. The tool does not properly sanitize or validate the XML documents it processes.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** While not explicitly stated as XXE, the description of "insecure XML parsing" and the ability to "open connections to other hosts, or leak information" suggests that the parser is susceptible to XXE injection or similar XML parsing vulnerabilities that allows access to external resources.
- **Lack of Secure XML Parsing Settings:** The core of the issue lies in the failure of `wsdlimport` to enforce secure XML parser settings, leaving it exposed to various XML-related attacks.
- **Unbounded resource consumption:** Processing of maliciously crafted XML documents can lead to excessive CPU and memory consumption.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the vulnerable application.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause a denial of service condition by causing the application to exhaust resources (CPU, memory).
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information by using malicious XML payloads that can read from other hosts.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious WSDL document:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a specially crafted WSDL document for `wsdlimport` to parse.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
- **Ability to provide a malicious WSDL document:** The attacker must be able to supply the malicious WSDL document to a system or application that uses `wsdlimport`.
- **No Authentication:** Exploitation can often occur without authentication

**Additional Details from the content:**

- **Red Hat:**  States the vulnerable component as "insecure XML parsing in wsdlimport (JAX-WS, 8182054)" in OpenJDK and notes it as "unspecified vulnerability fixed in 6u161, 7u151, and 8u141 (Deployment)"
- **Oracle CPU Advisory:** States that the vulnerability is in the JAX-WS component and confirms that it's fixed in multiple Oracle Java SE versions including 6u151, 7u141, 8u131
- **Gentoo Advisory:** States the vulnerability as being present in OpenJDK.
- **Debian Advisory:** Confirms the vulnerability was discovered in OpenJDK, affecting their oldstable distribution, and that it results in an "execution of arbitrary code, denial of service, information disclosure".
- **NetApp Advisory:** Notes that multiple NetApp products are affected through use of the Java SE software and that this vulnerability could lead to a "takeover of Java, a partial denial of service (DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process". Lists the vector as being "Multiple."

In summary, CVE-2017-10243 is caused by a lack of secure XML parsing in `wsdlimport` tool of the JAX-WS component in OpenJDK, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause DoS, or disclose sensitive information.
