| [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=697395#c7)  Robin Watts    2017-02-28 09:19:33 UTC  ``` Proposed fix:  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=user/robin/mupdf.git;a=commitdiff;h=29f0e3a6ea0cb02ae0c20a2d0f19561804af01ec>  Doesn't appear to be a JBIG2 issue at all, rather a scaling issue.  Will retry with the 1.9 source in case it appears differently. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=697395#c8)  Robin Watts    2017-03-01 06:03:54 UTC  ``` file_1.pdf problem fixed with:  commit [0c86abf954ca4a5f00c26f6600acac93f9fc3538](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?0c86abf954ca4a5f00c26f6600acac93f9fc3538) Author: Robin Watts <robin.watts@artifex.com> Date:   Tue Feb 28 17:15:40 2017 +0000      [Bug 697395](show_bug.cgi?id=697395 "RESOLVED FIXED - Artifex MuPDf JBIG2 Parser Code Execution Vulnerability"): Fix underflow in special case scaler.      When scaling a single row pixmap with a flip, I was getting     the offset to the far end of the line wrong due to forgetting     to allow for the alpha plane.      Fixed here.  file_2.pdf problem does not reproduce, hence closing.  Thanks for the report. Please reopen with new information if it still misbehaves for you. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=697395#c9)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2024-09-13 16:12:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to Robin Watts from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=697395#c8)) > file_2.pdf problem does not reproduce, hence closing.  I can successfully reproduce the issue with modern valgrind, and bisecting reveals that jbig2dec fixed this in  commit [e698d5c11d27212aa1098bc5b1673a3378563092](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?e698d5c11d27212aa1098bc5b1673a3378563092) (HEAD) Author: Robin Watts <robin.watts@artifex.com> Date:   Mon Dec 12 17:47:17 2016 +0000      Squash signed/unsigned warnings in MSVC jbig2 build.      Also rename "new" to "new_dict", because "new" is a bad     variable name.  Which was later included in  commit [1a7ef61410884daff8ff8391ddcecc3102acd989](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?1a7ef61410884daff8ff8391ddcecc3102acd989) Author: Tor Andersson <tor.andersson@artifex.com> Date:   Tue Dec 27 15:07:32 2016 +0100      Update jbig2dec. ``` |  |
