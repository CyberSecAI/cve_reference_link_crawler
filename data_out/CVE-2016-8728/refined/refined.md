Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `scale_single_row` function within the Fitz graphics library of MuPDF. Specifically, it's an incorrect pointer arithmetic calculation when scaling down font glyphs, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap out-of-bounds write:** The core issue is that the destination pointer (`dst`) is manipulated in a way that it can write outside the allocated memory region. This is caused by a mismatch between how the pointer is incremented within a loop and decremented outside it.
*   **Incorrect offset calculation**: When scaling a single row pixmap with a flip, the offset calculation to the far end of the line is incorrect because the code does not account for the alpha plane.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap metadata corruption:** The out-of-bounds write overwrites heap metadata, potentially leading to process termination and further exploitation.
*   **Sensitive process memory corruption:** The attacker can control the out-of-bounds write and manipulate the memory region it overwrites.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the input, it might be possible to achieve arbitrary code execution due to the memory corruption caused by out of bounds write.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted PDF file:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted PDF file is opened with a vulnerable version of MuPDF.
*   **Font glyph scaling:** The exploit specifically targets the glyph scaling functionality of MuPDF.
*   **Specific values for `n` and `count`:** The vulnerability requires certain values of `n` and `count` to trigger the out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious PDF:** The attacker needs to be able to create a PDF document that contains the specific parameters required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Victim interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a victim to open the malicious PDF with a vulnerable MuPDF reader.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in `source/fitz/draw-scale-simple.c` in the `scale_single_row` function.

The specific code snippet where the vulnerability occurs is:

```c
static void
scale_single_row(unsigned char * restrict dst, int dstride, const unsigned char * restrict src, const fz_weights * restrict weights, int src_w, int h, int forcealpha)
{
        const int *contrib = &weights->index[weights->index[0]];
        int min, len, i, j, n, nf;
        int tmp[FZ_MAX_COLORS];

        n = weights->n;
        nf = n + forcealpha;
...
        if (weights->flip)
        {
                dst += (weights->count-1)*n;
                for (i=weights->count; i > 0; i--)
                {
...
                        for (j = 0; j < nf; j++)
                        {
                                *dst++ = (unsigned char)(tmp[j]>>8);
                                tmp[j] = 128;
                        }
                        dst -= 2*nf;
                }
                dst += nf + dstride;
        }
```

The key issue lies in the `dst` pointer manipulation. The `dst` pointer is initially increased by `(weights->count - 1) * n`. Inside the outer loop, the inner loop increments `dst` by `nf` in each iteration. However, outside the inner loop `dst` is decremented by `2*nf`. If the outer loop iterates more than once, the pointer `dst` will eventually point to memory locations before its original value, resulting in an out-of-bounds write when writing to `*dst++`. This is because the decrement of `2*nf` is greater than the increment within the inner loop by `nf`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `0c86abf954ca4a5f00c26f6600acac93f9fc3538` by Robin Watts. The fix changed `dst += (weights->count-1)*n;` to `dst += (weights->count-1)*nf;`.
*   The provided bug report mentions a JBIG2 parser issue, but the fix shows that the vulnerability is indeed in the scaling logic, not in the JBIG2 parser.
