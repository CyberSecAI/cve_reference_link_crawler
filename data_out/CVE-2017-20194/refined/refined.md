Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-20194:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Formidable Form Builder plugin's implementation of a form preview AJAX function (`frm_forms_preview`) that was accessible without authentication. This function accepted parameters like `after_html` and `before_html` which allowed the injection of custom HTML, including WordPress shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive data by allowing unauthenticated users to export all form entries for a given form via the `frm_forms_preview` AJAX action. This is caused by the lack of proper access controls.
*   **Shortcode Evaluation:** The plugin evaluated WordPress shortcodes present in the `after_html` and `before_html` parameters. This allowed the execution of potentially dangerous shortcodes that could lead to other vulnerabilities.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `[display-frm-data]` shortcode contained a SQL injection vulnerability. The `order` attribute was not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the `ORDER BY` clause. This was a blind SQL injection, but could be exploited to retrieve database contents.
*   **Unauthenticated Form Entry Retrieval:** The `[formresults]` shortcode could be exploited to retrieve all form responses submitted to any form on the site without authentication.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The `after_html` and `before_html` parameters could be used to inject malicious HTML, leading to a POST-based reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Stored XSS:** HTML entered in forms was filtered using `wp_kses()`, which was insufficient to prevent dangerous HTML. This allowed an attacker to craft HTML code which would execute attacker-supplied JavaScript when a form entry was viewed by an administrator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers could retrieve all form entries, potentially exposing sensitive user data (PII).
*   **Database Compromise:** SQL injection could lead to the retrieval of all database contents, including user credentials, application data, and other sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Combined with other vulnerabilities or plugins (like iThemes Sync), attackers could achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could inject malicious scripts that could be executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers could send crafted HTTP POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, using the `frm_forms_preview` action and malicious parameters (`after_html`, `before_html`, `order_by`, etc.).
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Injection of malicious shortcodes into the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Form Submission:** Injection of malicious HTML in form submissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit most of these vulnerabilities. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs knowledge of a valid form ID in order to retrieve the form entries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Formidable Form Builder versions up to and including 2.05.03.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.05.03.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability could be exploited with the `sqlmap` tool.
*   The stored XSS vulnerability could be exploited to achieve remote code execution if the iThemes Sync plugin was also installed on the site.
*   The vulnerabilities were found and reported by Jouko Pynn√∂nen.
