- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A weak (low bit strength) device certificate is used in Palo Alto Networks Panorama software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate encryption strength (CWE-326) due to the use of a weak device certificate.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to intercept and decrypt traffic between the Panorama management server and the firewalls it manages, exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Panorama management server and the firewalls. They also need sufficient computing resources to break the encrypted communication. The attacker does not need any privileges, but the attack has a high complexity, requires user interaction (likely to place the attacker in a MITM position) and the attack requirements must be present.
