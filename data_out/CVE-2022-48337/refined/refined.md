{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing input sanitization in Emacs when processing file names passed to the shell.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability. Specifically, shell metacharacters within file names are not properly escaped when passed to external shell commands via the `etags` utility.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the system where Emacs is running.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted file names with shell metacharacters that are processed by `etags` when generating tags.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the file names that `etags` processes. This could be achieved by having the user open a project with maliciously named files, or by directly manipulating files in a directory processed by etags."
