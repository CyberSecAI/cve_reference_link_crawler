Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper memory initialization when handling util objects within Kofax Power PDF. Specifically, memory is accessed without being initialized first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Uninitialized memory access: The core issue is the failure to initialize memory before it is accessed by the application. This leads to undefined behavior, and in this case, remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This means the attacker gains control over the system with the same privileges as the user running Kofax Power PDF.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious file or webpage: Exploitation requires user interaction. The target user must either open a malicious file crafted to exploit this vulnerability or visit a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file or webpage that can trigger the vulnerability in Kofax Power PDF.
- The attacker requires the targeted user to interact with the malicious content (opening the file or visiting the page).
- No special privileges are required, this can be achieved by a non-privileged user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-23-964 and ZDI-CAN-20566.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Kofax Power PDF 5.0 Standard & Advanced in version 5.0.0.10.0.23307
