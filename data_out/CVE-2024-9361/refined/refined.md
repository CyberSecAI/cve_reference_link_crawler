Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `save_configuration` function of the "Bulk images optimizer: Resize, optimize, convert to webp, rename â€¦" WordPress plugin. This function is responsible for updating the plugin's options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin lacks a proper check to verify if the user initiating the `save_configuration` action has the necessary permissions to modify plugin settings. This allows unauthorized users to potentially change the plugin's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Plugin Option Modification:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker with minimal access (Subscriber level or higher) to modify the plugin's options. This could lead to various impacts depending on the specific plugin settings changed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network via an HTTP request to the WordPress admin-ajax.php endpoint.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to WordPress with at least a subscriber-level account.
- **Direct Access to vulnerable function:** Attackers need to send a request to the `wp_ajax_bir_save_configuration` AJAX action which is linked to `save_configuration` function, bypassing the authorization check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a valid WordPress account with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Wordfence report indicates that there is no known patch available, which suggests that the vulnerability is unaddressed in the latest version of the plugin up to 2.0.1.
- The `save_configuration` function is located in the `class-bir-loader.php` file of the plugin.
- The provided code snippet highlights the vulnerable function and the lack of capability checks.
- The severity is rated as "Medium" with a CVSS score of 4.3.
