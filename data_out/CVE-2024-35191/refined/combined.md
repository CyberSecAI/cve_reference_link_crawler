# Server-Side Template Injection for variable-enabled settings

Moderate

[engram-design](/engram-design)
published
GHSA-v45m-hxqp-fwf5
May 18, 2024

## Package

composer

verbb/formie
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<= 2.1.5

## Patched versions

2.1.6

## Description

### Impact

Users with access to a form's settings can include malicious Twig code into fields that support Twig. These might be the Submission Title or the Success Message. This code will then be executed upon creating a submission, or rendering the text.

This is listed as low-medium severity due to requiring control panel access to edit a form's settings.

### Patches

This has been fixed in Formie 2.0.44. Users should ensure they are running at least this version.

### Severity

Moderate

6.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
