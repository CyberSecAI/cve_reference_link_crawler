Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `renderObjectTemplate` and `renderString` functions without proper sanitization in the Formie plugin. These functions render Twig templates, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code when a user can control the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI): The core issue is the lack of input sanitization before rendering Twig templates. This allows attackers to inject malicious Twig code into various settings that support Twig.
- Unsafe usage of `renderObjectTemplate` and `renderString` functions: The plugin was using these functions without proper context, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By injecting malicious Twig code, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Full compromise of the application: If the attacker can achieve code execution, they could potentially gain control of the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Form Settings: Attackers can inject malicious Twig code via form settings that support Twig, such as:
  - Submission Title
  - Success Message
  - Redirect URLs
  - Webhook URLs
  - Email Filenames

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Control Panel Access: The attacker needs access to the Craft CMS control panel with permissions to edit form settings. This limits the attack to authenticated users with specific privileges, hence the moderate severity.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code was located within the `renderObjectTemplate` and `renderString` functions which did not sanitize the input.
- The fix involved switching from directly using `Craft::$app->getView()->renderObjectTemplate` to `Formie::$plugin->getTemplates()->renderObjectTemplate`.
- The commit also included sanitization of user inputs to prevent the use of long hand twig `{{` and `}}` in various places.
- The issue was present in versions <= 2.1.5 and patched in 2.1.6.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is identified by CVE-2024-35191 and GHSA-v45m-hxqp-fwf5.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 6.5 (Moderate).
- The attack vector is Network, attack complexity is Low, privileges required is High, and user interaction is None.
- The vulnerability impacts Confidentiality and Integrity, but not Availability.
