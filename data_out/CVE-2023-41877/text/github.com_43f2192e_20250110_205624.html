# GeoServer log file path traversal vulnerability

High

[jodygarnett](/jodygarnett)
published
GHSA-8g7v-vjrc-x4g5
Mar 19, 2024

## Package

maven

org.geoserver
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 2.23.4

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability requires GeoServer Administrator with access to the admin console to misconfigured the **Global Settings** for **log file location** to an arbitrary location.

This can be used to read files via the admin console **GeoServer Logs** page. It is also possible to leverage RCE or cause denial of service by overwriting key GeoServer files.

### Patches

As this issue requires GeoServer administrators access, often representing a trusted party, the vulnerability has not yet attracted a volunteer or resources.

Interested parties are welcome to contact geoserver-security@lists.osgeo.org for recommendations on developing a fix.

### Workarounds

A system administrator responsible for running GeoServer can define the `GEOSERVER_LOG_FILE` parameter, preventing the global setting provided from being used.

The `GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION` parameter can be set as system property, environment variable, or servlet context parameter.

Environmental variable:

```
export GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION=/var/opt/geoserver/logs
```

System property:

```
-DGEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION=/var/opt/geoserver/logs
```

Web application `WEB-INF/web.xml`:

```
  <context-param>
    <param-name> GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION </param-name>
    <param-value>/var/opt/geoserver/logs</param-value>
  </context-param>
```

Tomcat **conf/Catalina/localhost/geoserver.xml**:

```
<Context>
  <Parameter name="GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION"
             value="/var/opt/geoserver/logs" override="false"/>
</Context>
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
