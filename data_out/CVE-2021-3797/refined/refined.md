{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper implementation of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the Hestia Control Panel. The session token check was flawed, allowing an attacker to potentially bypass it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSRF vulnerability due to flawed session token check.",
      "The code was susceptible to CSRF juggling where the attacker could manipulate the token."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent. This could include actions such as adding, deleting, or modifying system configurations, databases, or user accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker could craft a malicious link or webpage that, when visited by a logged-in user, would send a forged request to the Hestia Control Panel.",
      "The attack relies on tricking a logged-in user into performing actions they didn't intend."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker does not need access to the user's session. However, they require the user to be authenticated to the application and perform an action they didn't intend.",
      "The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious request to the victim (e.g., through a link or a malicious website)."
