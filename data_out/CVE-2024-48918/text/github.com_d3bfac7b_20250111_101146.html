# Lack of Input Validation in RDS Light - Potential for Injection Attacks and Memory Tampering

High

[torinriley](/torinriley)
published
GHSA-5f6w-8mqh-hv2g
Oct 16, 2024

## Package

RDS Light v1.0.0 (beta)
(RDSai)

## Affected versions

<1.1.0

## Patched versions

RDS Light v1.1.0

## Description

## Impact

The vulnerability identified is a lack of input validation within the RDS AI framework, specifically within the user input handling code in the main module (`main.py`). This leaves the framework open to injection attacks and potential memory tampering.

Any user or external actor providing input to the system could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious commands, corrupt stored data, or affect API calls. This is particularly critical for users employing RDS AI in production environments where it interacts with sensitive systems, performs dynamic memory caching, or retrieves user-specific data for analysis.

**Impacted areas:**

* Developers using the RDS AI system as a backend for AI-driven applications.
* Systems running RDS AI that may be exposed to untrusted environments or receive unverified user inputs.

## Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in version **1.1.0** of the RDS AI framework. All user inputs are now sanitized and validated against a set of rules designed to mitigate malicious content.

**Recommended Action:**

* Users should upgrade to version **1.1.0** or higher.
* Ensure all dependencies are updated to their latest versions.

## Workarounds

For users unable to upgrade to the patched version, the following workaround can be implemented:

* **Manual Input Validation**: Implement custom validation checks for user inputs to filter out unsafe characters and patterns (e.g., SQL injection attempts, script injections).
* **Restrict External Inputs**: Limit or remove features that allow user input until the system can be patched.
