**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3891

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "Happy Addons for Elementor" plugin. Specifically, the `site_title_tag` setting was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious HTML/JavaScript to be stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the vulnerable widget, potentially leading to:
    - Account hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement
    - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via HTML tags within the `site_title_tag` setting of the plugin's widgets.
- An attacker can inject malicious code by manipulating this setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher within the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the settings of the vulnerable plugin's widgets.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is within the `happy-elementor-addons/trunk/widgets/site-title/widget.php` file.
- The patch implemented in version 3.10.6 includes the `ha_escape_tags()` function which performs sanitization on the `site_title_tag`.
- The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium)
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.10.5.
