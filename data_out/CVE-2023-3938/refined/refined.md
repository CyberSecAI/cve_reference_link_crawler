- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the vulnerable function in the library, that uses data from a QR code as a string within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The application directly embeds user-supplied input (from the QR code) into SQL queries, which allows malicious SQL code to be executed by the database.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass authentication and authenticate as any user by extracting data about users from the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is physical. An attacker would need to present a malicious QR code to the device's camera.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires physical access to the device and the ability to generate a QR code containing a SQL injection payload.
