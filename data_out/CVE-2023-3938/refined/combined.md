# Kaspersky Advisory

## (K-ZkTeco-2023-001) Bypassing ZkTeco-based OEM devices/ZKTeco biometric authentication system via SQLi in QR code

---

### Affected Hardware/Software

ZkTeco-based OEM devices (ZkTeco ProFace X, Smartec ST-FR043, Smartec ST-FR041ME and possibly others) with the ZAM170-NF-1.8.25-7354-Ver1.0.0 and possibly others

### Severity level

Impact: Allows you to authenticate under any user from the device database

Access Vector: Physical

### CVSS v3 Vector

CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVSS v3 Score

4.6

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-3938

### Vulnerability description

When displaying a QR code into the device's camera, SQL injection may occur if the request contains a quotation mark. The vulnerable function in library uses the data from the QR code as a string in the SQL query to get fields from the database. So an attacker can embed SQL code and get data about users from the database and thus authenticate.

### Remediation

Apply patch from vendor when it will be available for your device.

### Acknowledgements

Vulnerability was discovered by Alexander Zaytsev from Kaspersky.
