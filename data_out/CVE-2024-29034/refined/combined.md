# Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability which possibly leads to XSS remained

Moderate

[mshibuya](/mshibuya)
published
GHSA-vfmv-jfc5-pjjw
Mar 23, 2024

## Package

bundler

carrierwave
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 3.0.7 and < 2.2.6

## Patched versions

3.0.7, 2.2.6

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability [CVE-2023-49090](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-gxhx-g4fq-49hj) wasn't fully addressed.

This vulnerability is caused by the fact that when uploading to object storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to set a Content-Type value that is interpreted by browsers to be different from what's allowed by `content_type_allowlist`, by providing multiple values separated by commas.

This bypassed value can be used to cause XSS.

### Patches

Upgrade to [3.0.7](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/3.0.7) or [2.2.6](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/2.2.6).

### Workarounds

Use the following monkey patch to let CarrierWave parse the Content-type by using `Marcel::MimeType.for`.

```
# For CarrierWave 3.x
CarrierWave::SanitizedFile.class_eval do
  def declared_content_type
    @declared_content_type ||
      if @file.respond_to?(:content_type) && @file.content_type
        Marcel::MimeType.for(declared_type: @file.content_type.to_s.chomp)
      end
  end
end
```

```
# For CarrierWave 2.x
CarrierWave::SanitizedFile.class_eval do
  def existing_content_type
    if @file.respond_to?(:content_type) && @file.content_type
      Marcel::MimeType.for(declared_type: @file.content_type.to_s.chomp)
    end
  end
end
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
