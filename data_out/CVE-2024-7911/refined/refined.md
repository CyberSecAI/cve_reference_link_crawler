Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Unrestricted file inclusion vulnerability in the `index.php` file of the "Simple Online Bidding System" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Inclusion:** The application allows the user-controlled `page` parameter in the URL to include arbitrary files. This lack of input validation makes the application vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- **Pseudo-Protocol Support:** The vulnerability is compounded by the application's handling of pseudo-protocols like `php://filter`, allowing attackers to perform operations such as base64 encoding on included files, enabling them to read source code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration files (such as database credentials as shown in the PoC).
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although not explicitly demonstrated in this content, the ability to include arbitrary files can lead to RCE if the attacker can include malicious PHP code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The `page` URL parameter is manipulated to include the desired file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication or specific privileges seem to be required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must know the vulnerable URL and the ability to craft a URL containing malicious path and pseudo protocol.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates using the `php://filter` pseudo-protocol with the `convert.base64-encode` filter to read the contents of the `db_connect` file. This reveals that the attacker can access sensitive information.

This content provides more details than a typical CVE description, particularly in providing the specific vulnerable file path, PoC and a description of how the attacker can use `php://filter` to obtain sensitive source code.
