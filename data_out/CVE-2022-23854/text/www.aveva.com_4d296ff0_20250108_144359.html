NVD Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3.1)
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has adopted the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS v3.1) that provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT
vulnerabilities.  CVSS v3.1 produces a numerical score as well as a textual representation of that score
reflecting the severity of a vulnerability.  Scores range from 0.0 (no impact) to a maximum of 10.0
(critical impact with minimal effort to exploit). For additional information please refer to the CVSS v3.1
specifications.

Coordination with Authorities
Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and
report findings to applicable authorities for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
