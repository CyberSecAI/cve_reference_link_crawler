The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in PHP Jabbers scripts, including CVE-2023-36126.

**CVE-2023-36126**

*   **Root cause:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the "theme" parameter in the `preview.php` file.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the victim's browser session. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other harmful actions.
*  **Attack vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload within the "theme" parameter of `preview.php`. When the victim clicks this manipulated link, the injected script is executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious link to a victim and the victim has to be logged in the application.
