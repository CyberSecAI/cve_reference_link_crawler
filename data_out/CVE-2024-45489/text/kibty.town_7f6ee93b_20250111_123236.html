# gaining access to anyones browser without them even visiting a website

and of course, firebase was the cause (CVE-2024-45489)

we start at the homepage of arc. where i first landed when i first heard of it. i snatched a download and started analysing, the first thing i realised was that arc requires an account to use, why do they require an account?

## introducing arcs cloud features

so i boot up my mitmproxy instance and i sign up, and i see that they are using firebase for authentication, but no other requests, are they really just using firebase only for authentication?

after poking around for a bit, i discovered that there was a arc featured called easels, easels are a whiteboard like interface, and you can share them with people, and they can view them on the web. when i clicked the share button however, there was no requests in my mitmproxy instance, so whats happening here?

## hacking objective-c based firebase apps

from previous experience hacking an IOS based app, i immediately had a hunch on what this was, firestore.

firestore is a database-as-a-backend service that allows for developers to not care about writing a backend, and instead write database security rules and make users directly access the database.

this has [of course sparked a lot of services having insecure or insufficient security rules](https://env.fail/posts/firewreck-1) and since researching that, i would like to call myself a firestore expert.

firestore has a tendency to not abide by the system proxy settings in the Swift SDK for firebase, so going off my hunch, i wrote a frida script to dump the relevant calls.

```
var documentWithPath =
  ObjC.classes.FIRCollectionReference["- documentWithPath:"];
var queryWhereFieldIsEqualTo =
  ObjC.classes.FIRQuery["- queryWhereField:isEqualTo:"];
var collectionWithPath = ObjC.classes.FIRFirestore["- collectionWithPath:"];

function getFullPath(obj) {
  if (obj.path && typeof obj.path === "function") {
    return obj.path().toString();
  }
  return obj.toString();
}

var queryStack = [];

function logQuery(query) {
  var queryString = `firebase.${query.type}("${query.path}")`;
  query.whereClauses.forEach((clause) => {
    queryString += `.where("${clause.fieldName}", "==", "${clause.value}")`;
  });
  console.log(queryString);
}

Interceptor.attach(documentWithPath.implementation, {
  onEnter: function (args) {
    var parent = ObjC.Object(args[0]);
    var docPath = ObjC.Object(args[2]).toString();
    var fullPath = getFullPath(parent) + "/" + docPath;
    var query = { type: "doc", path: fullPath, whereClauses: [] };
    queryStack.push(query);
    logQuery(query);
  },
});

Interceptor.attach(collectionWithPath.implementation, {
  onEnter: function (args) {
    var collectionPath = ObjC.Object(args[2]).toString();
    var query = { type: "collection", path: collectionPath, whereClauses: [] };
    queryStack.push(query);
  },
});

Interceptor.attach(queryWhereFieldIsEqualTo.implementation, {
  onEnter: function (args) {
    var fieldName = ObjC.Object(args[2]).toString();
    var value = ObjC.Object(args[3]).toString();

    if (queryStack.length > 0) {
      var currentQuery = queryStack[queryStack.length - 1];
      currentQuery.whereClauses.push({ fieldName: fieldName, value: value });
    }
  },
  onLeave: function (retval) {},
});

var executionMethods = [
  "- getDocuments",
  "- addSnapshotListener:",
  "- getDocument",
  "- addDocumentSnapshotListener:",
  "- getDocumentsWithCompletion:",
  "- getDocumentWithCompletion:",
];

executionMethods.forEach(function (methodName) {
  if (ObjC.classes.FIRQuery[methodName]) {
    Interceptor.attach(ObjC.classes.FIRQuery[methodName].implementation, {
      onEnter: function (args) {
        if (queryStack.length > 0) {
          var query = queryStack.pop();
          logQuery(query);
        }
      },
    });
  }
});

function formatFirestoreData(data) {
  if (data.isKindOfClass_(ObjC.classes.NSDictionary)) {
    let result = {};
    data.enumerateKeysAndObjectsUsingBlock_(
      ObjC.implement(function (key, value) {
        result[key.toString()] = value.toString();
      })
    );
    return JSON.stringify(result);
  }
  return data.toString();
}

var documentMethods = [
  { name: "- updateData:completion:", type: "update" },
  { name: "- updateData:", type: "update" },
  { name: "- setData:completion:", type: "set" },
  { name: "- setData:", type: "set" },
];

documentMethods.forEach(function (method) {
  if (ObjC.classes.FIRDocumentReference[method.name]) {
    Interceptor.attach(
      ObjC.classes.FIRDocumentReference[method.name].implementation,
      {
        onEnter: function (args) {
          var docRef = ObjC.Object(args[0]);
          var data = ObjC.Object(args[2]);
          var fullPath = getFullPath(docRef);
          var formattedData = formatFirestoreData(data);
          console.log(
            `firebase.doc("${fullPath}").${method.type}(${formattedData})`
          );
        },
      }
    );
  } else {
    console.log("Warning: " + method.name + " not found");
  }
});

```

hacky script, but it works. so i launched arc with the script loaded on startup and this is what i got:

```
firebase.doc("preferences/UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12");
firebase.doc(
  "preferences/UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12/stringValues/autoArchiveTimeThreshold"
);
firebase.doc("preferences/UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12");
firebase.doc(
  "preferences/UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12/stringValues/autoArchiveLittleArcTimeThreshold"
);
firebase.doc("preferences/UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12");
firebase.doc(
  "preferences/UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12/stringValues/autoArchiveTimeThresholdsPerProfile"
);
firebase.doc("users/UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12");
firebase
  .collection("user_referrals")
  .where("inviter_id", "==", "UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12");
firebase
  .collection("boosts")
  .where("creatorID", "==", "UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12");

```

sick. so it looks like arc stores some preferences in firestore, along with a basic user object, referrals and boosts

## what the hell are arc boosts

arc boosts are a way for users to customize websites, by blocking elements, changing fonts, colors, and even using their own custom css and js.

**do you see where this is going?**, so, i manually logged into my account using my dummy page to test firebase accounts, and executed the exact same query to get my boosts:

![](/files/img/posts/arc/firebase-query-1.png)

cool, let me create a simple boost on google.com

![](/files/img/posts/arc/firebase-query-2.png)

hey! theres our boost, lets try changing some parameters around.

i see that it queries by `creatorID`, and we cant *query* a different creator ID than the original, but what if we update our own boost to have another users id?

well, i tried it with another account of mine, and this way the result when i went to google.com on the other computer (the victim one)

![](/files/img/posts/arc/alert-popup.png)

**what the fuck? it works?**

### quick recap

* arc boosts can contain arbitrary javascript
* arc boosts are stored in firestore
* the arc browser gets which boosts to use via the `creatorID` field
* **we can arbitrarily chage the `creatorID`Â field to any user id**

thus, if we were to find a way to easily get someone elses user id, we would have a full attack chain

## getting another users id

### user referrals

when someone referrs you to arc, or you referr someone to arc, you automatically get their user id in the `user_referrals` table, which means you could just ask someone for their arc invite code and they'd likely give it

### published boosts

you can share arc boosts (only if they don't have js in them) with other people, and arc has a [public site](https://arc.net/boosts) with boosts, and boostSnapshots (published boosts) contain the user id of the creator.

### user easels

arc has a feature called easels, which are basically whiteboards, you can share easels, and this also allows you to get someones user id.

## putting it together

this would be the final attack chain:

* obtain the user id of the victim via one of the mentioned methods
* create a malicious boost with whatever payload you want on your own account
* update the boost `creatorID` field to the targets
* whenever the victim visits the targeted website, they will get compromised

the browser company normally ~~does not do bug bounties~~ (update: see at the end of post), but for this catastrophic of a vuln, they decided to award me with **$2,000** USD

the timeline for the vulnerability:

* **aug 25 5:48pm**: got initial contact over signal (encrypted) with arc co-founder hursh
* **aug 25 6:02pm**: vulnerability poc executed on hursh's arc account
* **aug 25 6:13pm**: added to slack channel after details disclosed over encrypted format
* **aug 26 9:41pm**: vulnerability patched, bounty awarded
* **sep 6 7:49pm**: cve assigned (CVE-2024-45489)

## rce on priviliged pages

while poking around, i saw that boosts actually execute for other protocols aswell (even though you cant create them in the client), so someone could create a boost targeting the page `settings`, and it would execute on `chrome://settings`, which allows further escalation of priviliges.

## privacy concerns

while researching, i saw some data being sent over to the server, like this query everytime you visit a site:

```
firebase
  .collection("boosts")
  .where("creatorID", "==", "UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12")
  .where("hostPattern", "==", "www.google.com");

```

the `hostPattern` being the site you visit, this is against [arc's privacy policy](https://arc.net/privacy) which clearly states arc does not know which sites you visit.

## update

in light of these vulnerabilities and to introduce new features arc is switching off of firebase. additionally, [arc has published their own write-up](https://arc.net/blog/CVE-2024-45489-incident-response) addressing these issues

a tldr version would be:

* confirming they had fixed the issue
* they are adding a feature to disable boosts in the client, preventing this vulnerability from happening on people that do not use boosts
* they are doing an audit of their current firebase ACL rules internally
* they have estabilished proper protocols for security issues

additionally, from internal discussions with arc they are also:

* are fixing the mentioned privacy concerns in the v1.61.1 update
* moving off firebase for new features and products
* they are doing a external security audit for this version
* are starting a bug bounty program for further vulnerabilities
