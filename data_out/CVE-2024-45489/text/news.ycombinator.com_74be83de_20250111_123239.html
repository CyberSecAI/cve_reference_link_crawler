Even though no users were affected and we patched it right away, the hypothetical depth of this vulnerability is unacceptable. We’ve written up some technical details and how we’ll improve in the future (including moving off Firebase and setting up a proper bug bounty program) here: <https://arc.net/blog/CVE-2024-45489-incident-response>. I'm really sorry about this, both the vuln itself and the delayed comms around it, and really appreciate all the feedback here – everything from disappointment to outrage to encouragement. It holds us accountable to do better, and makes sure we prioritize this moving forward. Thank you so much. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [ayhanfuat](user?id=ayhanfuat) [3 months ago](item?id=41603984)   | [parent](#41603670) | [next](#41606272) [–]  Was the post written for HN users only?

It falls a bit flat for me where you address the tracking of domains visited by users, I don't think this accurately addresses or identifies the core issues. When you say "this is against our privacy policy and should have never been in the product to begin with"--okay, so how did get there? This wasn't a data leak due to a bug it was an intentionally designed feature that made its way through any review process which might be in place to production without being challenged. What processes will you put in place to prevent future hidden violations of your stated policies? Edit just to say, dubious as I am I sincerely hope Arc can overcome these issues and succeed. We desparately need more browsers, badly enough that I'll even settle for a Chromium-based one as long as it isn't made by Microsoft. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zamadatix](user?id=zamadatix) [3 months ago](item?id=41606766)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41606209) | [prev](#41607115) | [next](#41605935) [–]  Right now You and Arc are advertising it's ideal to position posts such as "Hidden Features in Arc Search" to users but security bulletins and remediations are something that need a hidden stopgap until you've scrambled to build an alternative site to hide them away at instead. Browser security is more than finding the best PR strategy, it's a mindset that prioritizes the user's well being over the product's image. I've deleted my account and uninstalled Arc. Not because of the issue in itself, but because it's clear what the response has been aiming to protect (not my data). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zamadatix](user?id=zamadatix) [3 months ago](item?id=41613340)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41606766) | [next](#41623992) [–]  The sibling comment to this by sieabahlpark is already dead but to respond in case they get a chance to read the thread again anways: The engineers already closed the hole, the blog post was already published, more work was (/is still?) going to be done to make a new site to hide them in. I wasn't asking for them to move engineers off patching to blog posting, I was asking for the already created blog posting to be made as visible in the blog the same as the posts were (which is now the case, so at least there is that). In regards to whether or not they did analysis to show it wasn't exploited that was indeed nice to see but you still have to make the post visible anyways because you're not always right, even if you're one of the biggest companies in the world [https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/17/microsoft\_zero\_day\_sp...](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/17/microsoft_zero_day_spoofing_flaw/) The measure to meet here is transparency, not perfection. And no, I wasn't really sitting around waiting for a good opportunity to delete my account and uninstall my main browser. That would be... very odd? I'm free to change browser without a reason to blame haha. I didn't say what I was switching to either (it's quite irrelevant to the topic), which can certainly be more than one of 2 options you have quips for. Regardless which option, the measure to meet here is again not perfection but transparency and yes, others do meet that well and above how Arc did in this case. More than anything, the reason for responding is less to argue about most of those points (I even debate just removing them now as they may detract from the point) and more to point out "real" transparency on security incidents (not just what a PR person would say gives the best image) is as big a factor in trusting a company with your data as their actual response to vulnerabilities. It doesn't matter that a company looks great 100% of the time they tell you about things if you know they are being intentionally stingy on showing you anything about it since you now have no way to trust they'd show you the bad anyways. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zamadatix](user?id=zamadatix) [3 months ago](item?id=41620090)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41613340) | [next](#41614417) [–]  (repeat of the above response type. Sorry if this breaks a rule or something Dang, but it's a pretty tame/decent conversation) This is still responding to a different complaint. The operational performance of "optimally distributing" the message, or however you want to word it, on was/is both imperfect and perfectly fine at the same time. Where the ball was dropped was in responding to a complaint about how the posting was specially hidden where the communicated action was how it will be shown on a different site in the future in place of acknowledging it should be visible as a normal post currently. When the alarms are going off you're going to be slow, you're going to make the wrong decision on something minor, you're going to wish you had done x by y point in time looking back, you're going to have been imperfect. All that kind of stuff was handled fine (from what I can tell) here. The disappointment in transparency was in deflecting a presented highlight in how to fix a visibility issue instead of outright acknowledging it was a miss. My message was/is about how that's not cool. Not that their handling of the issue itself was bad or an expectation of apology or expectation more resources should have been put on doing x, y, or z. Just that deflecting callouts on security communication issues with deferrals and redirection is not a cool way to handle security communication. They've since changed it, which is cool of them, but the damage was done with me (and maybe some others) in the meantime. Maybe in the future they handle that differently, maybe they don't, but for now I lost the trust I had that they always will, even when nobody is looking, since they didn't even when they knew people were. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sieabahlpark](user?id=sieabahlpark) [3 months ago](item?id=41614417)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41613340) | [prev](#41620090) | [next](#41623992) [–]  Every comment I make is immediately dead upon me posting, it's been that way for about a year. I believe transparency is necessary, but also have been in the situation where the alarms are going off and you slip on making sure disclosures are optimally distributed. Generally I'm just concerned that it's documented at all. Now if they maintained not revealing the security issue over the following week I'd agree. Should they have had a bulletin stating when it occurred in August? Absolutely. I'm not disagreeing, and the distance from that event I would agree with you. However, considering just how fundamental the security vulnerability was there isn't exactly an immediate benefit to blast that to the world. It opens up the spotlight for more advanced attacks to take advantage of other unpatched holes. Taking the time to go through and \_really\_ make sure it's patched (as well as a general check around the codebase for other EZ vulns) is, in my opinion, the better option. Now if this had been a larger timeframe and repeated offense I'd agree the security hygiene for Arc should be bumped up in priority ASAP and until that probably happens Arc as a platform could not be trusted. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Vinnl](user?id=Vinnl) [3 months ago](item?id=41636407)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41614417) | [next](#41623992) [–]  (I've vouched for this comment, maybe that helps.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [netdevnet](user?id=netdevnet) [3 months ago](item?id=41623992)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41606766) | [prev](#41613340) | [next](#41605935) [–]  why would even use a browser that requires you to have an account to use it?

A couple friends use Arc and they like it, so I had considered switching to it myself. Now, I won't, not really because of this vulnerability itself (startups make mistakes), but because you paid a measly $2k bounty for a bug that owns, in a dangerous way, all of your users. I won't use a browser made by a vendor who takes the security of their users this unseriously. By the way, I don't know for sure, but given the severity I suspect on the black market this bug would have gone for a \_lot\_ more than $2k. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [poincaredisk](user?id=poincaredisk) [3 months ago](item?id=41606627)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41606272) | [next](#41606650) [–]  Selling vulnerability on the black market is immoral and may be illegal. The goal of bug bounty programs was initially to signal "we won't sue white hat researchers who disclose their findings to us", when did it evolve into "pay me more than criminals would, or else"? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tolmasky](user?id=tolmasky) [3 months ago](item?id=41606682)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41606627) | [next](#41606650) [–]  Let's set aside morality for a second. There is a reason low payouts are bad without even having to consider the black market: it pushes people to search for bugs in a competitor's app that pays more instead of in your app! If your app is paying out $2K and a competing app pays out $100K, why would anyone bother searching for bugs in your app? Every minute spent researching your app pay 1/50th of what you'd get searching in the competing app (unless your app has 50x more bugs I suppose, but perhaps then you have bigger problems...). I'm always so confused by the negative responses to people asking for higher bug bounties. It feels like it still comes from this weird entitlement that researchers owe you the bug report. Perhaps they do. But you know what they definitely *don't owe you*? Looking for new bugs! Ultimately this attitude always leads to the same place: the places that pay more protect their users better. It is thus completely reasonable to decide not to use a product as a user if the company that makes the product isn't paying high bug bounties. It's the same as discovering that a restaurant is cheeping out on health inspections and deciding to no longer eat there. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [voidwtf](user?id=voidwtf) [3 months ago](item?id=41610961)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41606682) | [next](#41606998) [–]  Bug bounties are always in relation to severity, number of users potentially at risk, and market cap. A browser operating at a deficit from a small company with a small market share cannot pay 100k even if they wanted to. If you and a couple friends released an app that had 50k users and you’d not even broken even, can I claim my 100k by finding a critical RCE? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tolmasky](user?id=tolmasky) [3 months ago](item?id=41611903)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41610961) | [next](#41624106) [–]  No, because you probably haven’t bothered to find said CVE. There’s a strange refusal to understand the simplest market considerations here. I understand it sucks and you may not be able to afford it, but the *consequence*, regardless of all the *reasons* you can give, is that you will get less of the *right* kind of attention (security researchers). Now, you can hope that you will also get less of the *wrong* kind of attention too, and if you’re lucky all of these will scale together. Or, alternatively, you can for example not start by introducing features like Boosts that have a higher probability of adding security vulnerabilities, counter-acting the initial benefit of riding in Chrome’s security by using the same engine. Browsers are particularly sensitive products. It’s a tough space because you’re asking users to live their life in there. In theory using Chromium as a base should be a good hack to be able to do this while plausibly offering comparable security to the well established players. Long story short, there are ways to creatively solve this problem, or avoid it, but simply exclaiming “well it would be too hard to do the necessary thing” is probably not a good solution. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [voidwtf](user?id=voidwtf) [3 months ago](item?id=41612970)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41611903) | [next](#41624106) [–]  lol, that’s not how this works, that’s not how any of this works… you cannot demand more than someone is willing to or able to pay, either a researcher out there will spend some time on it because it’s a relatively new contender to the market and they’re hoping for low hanging fruit, or they won’t. obviously the bounty was enough for someone to look at it and get paid out for a find, otherwise we wouldn’t be having this conversation. trying to argue that they should set a bounty high enough to make it worth *your* time is pointless and a funny stance to take. feel free to ignore it or be upset that they aren’t offering enough to make *you* feel secure, it’s not going to make 100k appear out of thin air. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tolmasky](user?id=tolmasky) [3 months ago](item?id=41613723)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41612970) | [next](#41624106) [–]  I’m not a security researcher, so it’s really not about me. You seem to be confused about what we’re even arguing about, this discussion started because someone said they wouldn’t use this browser because the low bug bounty amount represents that the company isn’t taking security seriously. My posts simply defend why this is a perfectly reasonable stance to take. They are not me demanding an increase in bug bounties so that I will work on them. A good trick if you’re ever confused about a discussion is to simply scroll up and read the posts, I’ll make it even easier for you, this is where it starts: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41606272> Secondly, in a true demonstration of confusion, if you read my posts they demand nothing. They simply state what are likely outcomes of certain choices. I’m not sure how to possibly make the stance of “if you pay smaller bug bounties in a market that has other offerings, you will get less research focused on your product” any simpler. It seems fairly straightforward… and the existence of *one* bug report does not somehow “disprove” this. Why not make the bug bounty $1 otherwise? Oh, is that a ridiculous suggestion? Because that might not be a worthwhile enough incentive perhaps? But who are *you* to dictate what is and isn’t a worthwhile incentive. “That’s not how this works. That’s not how any of this works…” > “either a researcher out there will spend some time on it […] or they won’t.” Yes, I agree with this truism that they either will spend time on it or they won’t. Interestingly, this is true in all scenarios. My point is how to optimize researchers spending time on your product (which in theory you are inclined to do if your are offering a bounty), and I then separately even make suggestions for how to possibly require less attention by making safer choices and being able to “ride” on another project’s bug bounties. But again, the simplest point here is that the position of “we offer low bug bounties because that is what we can afford” is fine, it’s just also absolutely defensible to be completely turned off by it as a potential *user of that product*, for the likely security implications of that position. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [netdevnet](user?id=netdevnet) [3 months ago](item?id=41624106)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41610961) | [prev](#41611903) | [next](#41606998) [–]  Put it this way.

You don't have to beat the black market price of a vuln because that route is much riskier, but somewhere at least in the same order of magnitude sounds decent. It's not about viewing security researchers as sociopaths who will always sell to the highest bidder, the fact is there will always be criminals going for exploits and bug bounties can help not just by paying off someone that would have otherwise abused a bug but also by attracting an equally motivated team who would otherwise be entirely uninvolved to play defense. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JumpCrisscross](user?id=JumpCrisscross) [3 months ago](item?id=41606650)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41606272) | [prev](#41606627) | [next](#41606520) [–]  > *because you paid a measly $2k bounty for a bug that owns, in a dangerous way, all of your users* The case is redeemable.

Wait 5-10 years and then make your move. Personally, I expect stuff like this from challenger alternatives, this is the way it should be. There is no such thing as a new, bug-free software product.

That would involve risk of *immediate physical harm.* On the other hand, we’re talking about a 2 year old browser leaking what websites you visit. Do you also think Firefox in 2006 was bulletproof? The entire internet and every single OS & browser was a leaky bucket back then. The current safety-ism, paranoia and risk-aversion around consumer software on this forum is hilarious to me. Maybe they shouldn’t have called this place “Hacker” news, because it’s now full of people LARPing as international intelligence agency targets from a 90s movie. If the prying Five Eyes are such a concern for you, maybe use a fake email when signing up for stuff and your browser history is instantly anonymized.

Its not even just merely an error its about some very questionable architecture.

With that said, I think you're probably right. I doubt Firebase audit logs contain update contents, and based on the bug report, your "in and out" proposal is as simple as: firebase.collection("boosts").where("creatorID", "==", "attackers\_user\_id").update({"creatorId": "victims\_user\_id" }); sleep(time); firebase.collection("boosts").where("creatorID", "==", "victims\_user\_id").update({"creatorId": "attackers\_user\_id" }); (okay, not exactly, because this would also set the ownership of the victim's legitimate Boosts, but the actual code isn't much more difficult). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cutemonster](user?id=cutemonster) [3 months ago](item?id=41607580)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41605695) | [prev](#41605789) | [next](#41611573) [–]  They have more users than what I could have guessed: > As of July 2023, The Browser Company has 100,000+ users [https://www.boringbusinessnerd.com/startups/the-browser-comp...](https://www.boringbusinessnerd.com/startups/the-browser-company#:~:text=Company%20Traction&text=As%20of%20July%202023%2C%20The,from%20751%20in%20June%202022). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [behringer](user?id=behringer) [3 months ago](item?id=41611573)   | [root](#41603670) | [parent](#41605695) | [prev](#41607580) | [next](#41607094) [–]  It doesn't matter what bug bounty pay pay.

There is a reason people crave, want and seek things like SO and blog-posts. They're packed full of insight, working examples and just plain old "how TF do you use this thing".

I'm sorry but if the whole design is "one big database shared with everyone and we must manually configure the database for auth" there is a problem that's deeper than just having to read the doc. It means the basic understanding of what it means to keep data as private as possible is not understood. A shared database only works when the server accesses it, not when client has direct access. What Arc needs is to segregate *each* user's data in a different place, in the design of the database, not as part of configuration of custom code. Make it impossible to list all user's data, or even users. When, not if, an id is guessed, related data becomes accessible by someone else; make it so that someone else still can't read it, or can't replace it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [esperent](user?id=esperent) [3 months ago](item?id=41614575)   | [root](#41601814) | [parent](#41605908) | [next](#41603488) [–]  Also how does this work legally with regards to data sovereignty?

Firebase security rules (like with other BaaS systems like Firebase) have this weird default that is hard to describe. Basically, if I write my own API, I will set the userId of the record (a 'boost' in this case) to the userId from the session, rather than passing it in the request payload. *It would never even occur* to a developer writing their own API past a certain level of experience to let the client pass (what is supposed to be) their own userId to a protected API route.

It is pretty easy to think "the owner can update the document" without realizing that there are some fields (that the official client doesn't set) that shouldn't be updated (like the owner or created timestamp). The correct solution is likely default-deny auth for every single field. Then you at least have to explicitly make the owner field writable, and hopefully consider the impact of transfering this object to another user. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ARandomerDude](user?id=ARandomerDude) [3 months ago](item?id=41605192)   | [prev](#41597804) | [next](#41598969) [–]  I'm amazed by how profoundly stupid this vulnerability is.

For example: Situation: Person A bumps into Person B in the cafe, causing B to drop their coffee cup. A: I’m so sorry! Let me buy you another coffee. B: That’s not necessary - it was an accident, and I had almost finished my drink anyway. A: It’s the least I can do! B: Oh, thank you so much! Buying B a new coffee is not \_literally\_ the least A could have done - the least A could have done is nothing - but that’s the English idiom. “Can” is acting more like “should” here. You could read it as “It’s the least I can do (if I’m a good person, which I am)”. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gwd](user?id=gwd) [3 months ago](item?id=41608303)   | [root](#41598211) | [parent](#41607583) | [next](#41602267) [–]  Thank you for the explanation -- when I'm speaking foreign languages I appreciate this sort of explanation. But in this case, as a native English speaker, I was well aware of the idiom, and was trying to subvert it. :-) The original idiom is said in the first person, and as you say means essentially, "Justice and equity compel me to do this; I don't find myself able to do less". GGP was actually using a derivative of the idiom in the second person. What the derivative literally says is, "Justice and equity compel them to do this; *they* don't find *themselves* able to do less". But idiomatically, what it actually means is, "Justice and equity *ought to* compel them to do this; they *ought not* to find themselves able to do any less". Which is true; but it's still the case that the vast majority of companies find themselves very much able to do far less. Justice and equity *should* compel companies to do this bare minimum, but in the vast majority of cases it *doesn't*. And so we should still commend those who do find themselves so compelled, and hold them up as an example.

It’s honestly the best browser UX I’ve seen, the right combination of vertical tabs, auto archiving, spaces/collections, sync, etc. I don’t care for Easels, but the core is good. Except… the growth hacks have started to creep in. They overlay an advert for their own AI services on top of regular Google search results pages in their mobile app. Not even a browser chrome UI element, it’s literally over the page content. That feels like a huge violation of what it means to be a browser. I don’t want their AI features. I don’t want growth hacks. I don’t want to sign in except for sync. I’d happily pay $40 a year for Arc as a product-focused-product, but as a VC-focused-product it’s heading downhill. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jwells89](user?id=jwells89) [3 months ago](item?id=41602606)   | [root](#41598211) | [parent](#41601332) | [next](#41603469) [–]  It does get a lot right and feels smooth in ways that Chrome, the various Chrome-clones, and Firefox just don't. It's also ironically the only browser even trying to feel native on Windows, using WinUI/WinAppSDK for its UI there, despite originally being Mac only.

Even an open-source, decentralized, blockchain, grass-fed, organic, extra virgin, written in nothing but HTML, released by W3C itself browser could monetize just ~5% of market share if users are downloading their build (or if its baked into the source), considering how much a browser reveals about its user and to the extent the user can be retargeted for: Ads, marketing, surveillance, analytics. The biggest opportunity has to be driving search traffic to the major search providers all these browsers partner with. Could also get acquired by a major browser vendor if you have a better product and people are downloading it more than the major ones, especially if both are based on the same underlying engine. Even Firefox still sucks to this day. I'm using it right now (Waterfox) the product still sucks! I know of some browser vendors acquiring others, especially as mobile took off and it was hard to get it right. Seems like the opportunity is similar to that of social media but slightly more modern because nobody uses new social media anymore but people are trying out new browsers (and you get richer user/usage data). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [throwaway48540](user?id=throwaway48540) [3 months ago](item?id=41600448)   | [root](#41598211) | [parent](#41598436) | [prev](#41599694) | [next](#41600105) [–]  I don't see an issue, using something like Firebase is what a smart engineer would do.

It's really disappointing to see. But I still disagree that the use of Firebase, in and of itself, is a bad engineering decision. It's just a tool, and it's up to you how you use it. Firebase gives you all features needed to secure your backend. But if you configure it incorrectly, then \_that's\_ where the poor engineering comes into play. It should have been tested more comprehensively. Sure. You could build your own backend rather than using a Backend-as-a-Service platform. But for what gain?

Browsers are very important part of our life. If someone compromises our browsers , they basically compromise every single aspect of privacy and can lead to insane scams. And because arc browser is new , they wanted to build fast and so they used tools like firebase / firestore to be capable of moving faster (they are a startup) Now I have read the article but I am still not sure how much of this can be contributed to firebase or arc On the following page from same author (I think) <https://env.fail/posts/firewreck-1> , tldr states - Firebase allows for easy misconfiguration of security rules with zero warnings - This has resulted in hundreds of sites exposing a total of ~125 Million user records, including plaintext passwords & sensitive billing information So because firebase advocates itself to the developers as being safe yet not being safe , I think arc succumbed to it. firestore has a tendency to not abide by the system proxy settings in the Swift SDK for firebase, so going off my hunch, Also , you say that you have been convinced to never use arc again. Did you know that chrome gives an unfair advantage to its user sites by giving system information (core usage etc.) and some other things which are not supposed to be seen by browsers only to the websites starting with \*.google.com ? this is just recently discovered , just imagine if something more serious is also just waiting in the shadows Couldn't this also be considered a major security vulnerability just waiting to be happen if some other exploit like this can be discovered / google.com is leaked and now your cpu information and way more other stuff which browsers shouldn't know is with a malicious threat actor ? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nine\_k](user?id=nine_k) [3 months ago](item?id=41600231)   | [root](#41598211) | [parent](#41600002) | [next](#41600115) [–]  I very much agree with the idea that browsers are security-sensitive software, unlike, say, a picture editor, and more like an ssh server. It should be assumed to be constantly under attack. And browser development is exactly *not* the area where I would like to see the "move fast, break things" attitude. While firebase may be sloppy with security and thus unfit for certain purposes, I would expect competent developers of a browser to do due diligence before considering to use it, or whatever else, for anything even remotely related to security. Or, if they want to experiment, I'd rather that be opt-in, and come with a big banner: *"This is experimental software. DO NOT attempt to access your bank account, or your real email account, or your social media accounts"*. With that, I don't see much exploit potential in learning stats like the number of cores on your machine. Maybe slightly more chances of fingerprinting, but nothing comparable to the leak through improper usage of firebase. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Imustaskforhelp](user?id=Imustaskforhelp) [3 months ago](item?id=41611117)   | [root](#41598211) | [parent](#41600231) | [next](#41600115) [–]  hmm interesting. Other thing to add is if we treat it as a ssh server , we actually won't try to go out and break things. But I think that was the whole point of arc , to break the convention and be something completely new and I have a reason why They were competing with the giants called google , safari , firefox which have insanely large funding and their whole point was trying to sell something later built on this arc browser. and since chrome , firefox etc. don't try to come up with these ideas because well security reasons (which I agree to / as seen in the post) I think arc wanted to seperate itself from chrome / firefox and that's why they became a bit reckless you could say since this exploit was available. Also the other thing I want to convey , is that "With that, I don't see much exploit potential in learning stats like the number of cores on your machine" this was only recently discovered. Just imagine the true amount of exploits in these proprietory solutions which we don't know about. Yeh. Just like a ssh server , I would personally like the source code to be available but developing browsers is time consuming and money intensive for developers but ladybird exists , but its in beta. that being said , not open source is also that private , (xz) , but atleast it got discovered way quickly and was able to mitigate it quickly | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [prmoustache](user?id=prmoustache) [3 months ago](item?id=41600115)   | [root](#41598211) | [parent](#41600002) | [prev](#41600231) | [next](#41601502) [–]  You do know that there are more than chrome and arc right? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Imustaskforhelp](user?id=Imustaskforhelp) [3 months ago](item?id=41611060)   | [root](#41598211) | [parent](#41600115) | [next](#41601502) [–]  I understand.

What is concerning is the nature of the vulnerability and how it speaks to their security culture (which is obviously non-existent). This also revealed that their privacy policy is pure marketing fluff, completely disconnected from (and, in fact, counter to) their actions.

Otherwise they're "drawing attention" to the style and themselves for narcissistic reasons. I would simply assume they'd have to know the annoyance this brings to the reader, so I assume it's on purpose. I would feel the same about someone writing code in a consistently purposeful unorthodox style and against convention in such an obvious and effortful way that no one is used to. Personally, and YMMV, I like to *try* to write in as clear a way as I can to get my point across as much as possible. Useless stylistic fluff in something that isn't poetry, seems counter to that purpose. >mistakes It's not a mistake though to ensure every letter one writes is not following convention and English syntax.

You highlight stylistic choices. I'd say we can observe the differences in different styles and see how uses them. Is Trump writing in all lowercase? No. Is this poster writing like Trump? No. Do a lot of left-wing people use the all-lowercase style?

It’s harder to follow and looks as if the writer didn’t care to do the bare minimum to make the text accessible and clear to the reader. > there’s a Tom Scott Language Files video documenting it Per that video (thank you for sharing), capital letters “make a paragraph easier to read” and “context matters” and “the conventions change fairly quickly” and typing in all lowercase is “*sometimes* okay”. This is a post *documenting* a serious browser vulnerability, shared to the wide internet, not an informal conversation between buddies. Clarity matters. I don’t fully buy the tone argument and find words and sentence structure are more important. Take the following two examples: > Just heard about your promotion, you beautiful bastard! Let’s go get pissed to celebrate, on me! And: > good afternoon mrs bartlet. the limousine will be available in twenty minutes. i would also like to apologise for my behaviour yesterday when i inadvertently insulted your husband it was a faux pas i promise will not be repeated. my resignation will be on your desk by noon. I get that language evolves. You do you. Personally I hope this trend subsides like so many others before it. Maybe you don’t like to read properly structured text and prefer all lowercase. My preference is the reverse. And that’s OK, we don’t all have to be the same. I merely wish that people who prefer a certain style understand not everyone will see it the same way they do (and I’m including myself). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Wingy](user?id=Wingy) [3 months ago](item?id=41605457)   | [root](#41599161) | [parent](#41601600) | [next](#41603580) [–]  That's true.

So writing without caps is a bit of a jerk move. You're making it harder for me to read, either because you're lazy or because you want to affect a style. In either case it's a bit of a jerk move. It's more of a jerk move when it's done on a discussion board, because what you write once is read multiple times. So the cost multiplies, but (if due to laziness) the benefit only occurs once. Now, in something like texting, I understand, when you're trying to type on that teeny phone keyboard. It's harder to hit the shift key when you don't have a spare finger because you're only using one. But for something like here, take the time and the effort to make it better for your readers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Wingy](user?id=Wingy) [3 months ago](item?id=41605425)   | [root](#41599161) | [parent](#41604877) | [next](#41606618) [–]  On a formal discussion board like this, I don't believe an informal tone is correct. To me, it doesn't make it harder to read, but it does come across as mildly disrespectful of the environment. When texting on a phone, the default is to automatically capitalize. Using all-lowercase requires more work than doing nothing. It isn't lazy or even more efficient to go back and replace your "I"s with "i"s. With the right reader, it's done to give them a better idea of the tone you wish to deliver. With that said, it requires a certain degree of audience awareness. Many people do not interpret lack of capitalization the same way I do, as evidenced by this thread. On my phone, I have auto-capitalization disabled. When texting someone for the first time, I tend to use proper capitalization, even if I want a casual tone. I just did a typing test with capitalization and punctuation and scored 55 wpm on my phone. It's a choice I make and it varies based on audience, and intended tone. Effort, on the other hand, is not a factor. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [homebrewer](user?id=homebrewer) [3 months ago](item?id=41606618)   | [root](#41599161) | [parent](#41604877) | [prev](#41605425) | [next](#41606754) [–]  I use lowercase in most places precisely because it forces me to use shorter sentences and split text into paragraphs.

For my day to day browsing Arc has: # Split screen tabs Zen and Floorp both have this but the UX for both is really clunky. Surely they'll improve but Arc felt like second nature. # Little Arcs As far as I know, neither Zen or Floorp have this feature and if they do then the UX is not as obvious as Arc. The UX around Little Arcs is almost perfect. If I click on a link, it opens as a modal that I can expand to its own tab if I need or dismiss by just clicking away. The same things happens in other apps so I don't lose context just because I wanted to look at a link quick. If I do want to bring that tab into a space then it's 1-2 clicks away. My only gripe with this is that the Little Arcs that are created from clicking links in other apps don't auto dismiss if you change focus but this might just be a setting I don't have configured. # Inset meetings/videos AFAIK neither has this feature either. Having videos that are playing just seamlessly pop-up picture-in-picture when navigating away from the video tab is useful enough but the meeting feature is key for me because my company uses Google Meet. I can navigate away from meetings to look-up info/check Slack/etc without losing focus on the meeting itself and getting back to the meeting tab or unmuting myself is 1 click away. Sure all of these things could probably be accomplished by browser extensions but I think the UI/UX within Arc is pretty tough to compete with. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [userbinator](user?id=userbinator) [3 months ago](item?id=41598543)   | [prev](#41603904) | [next](#41601032) [–]  *while researching, i saw some data being sent over to the server, like this query everytime you visit a site* I'm not surprised in the least --- basically the vast majority of software these days is spyware.

This scenario I laid out is kinda to your point of "don't anchor your entire company on it" - the only point I'm trying to add is that you can also use these tools without the company being "anchored" on it, and they could have still ran into the same issue as Arc. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sergiotapia](user?id=sergiotapia) [3 months ago](item?id=41606519)   | [root](#41606365) | [parent](#41606426) | [next](#41620619) [–]  I mentioned javascript because I mostly see that cohort jump feet first into services like firebase/supabase/clerk/vercel/etc. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bschmidt1](user?id=bschmidt1) [3 months ago](item?id=41606625)   | [root](#41606365) | [parent](#41606519) | [next](#41620619) [–]  Vercel too?!

The UI for the browser is great, but Arc really needs to lay the groundwork for strong security controls or it'll struggle to gain (or even maintain) a foothold in the enterprise space. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jongjong](user?id=jongjong) [3 months ago](item?id=41599480)   | [prev](#41620619) | [next](#41602633) [–]  This is a nice investigation and a great read.

But you can take security seriously without having a program in place to pay non employees for work they did without you asking them to. Also, while I love companies that have bug bounty programs... I don't think any company without such a program is under any obligation to pay someone just because they volunteered their time without the company knowing about it or soliciting the work in any way. So the fact that they did in this case, despite having no program, is what I'm choosing to focus on. I want to share a personal anecdote to put my opinion into more perspective. I owned a small business operating a for-profit website for 18 years, for 15 of those years it was my primary source of income. I had no employees other than myself. It was just me on my own working from home. I earned enough to pay the bills, but I'm currently earning 2x what my business earned at its peak traffic by being an employee. So it's not like I had money to be paying people... it was pretty much an average software engineer's salary in terms of what I brought in. Anyway, over those 18 years I had a few dealings with some white-hats who were very nice and clued me in to some issues. I thanked them and when they politely asked if "we" (because they didn't know any better) had a program it was a non-issue when I explained that I'm too broke as a one-person shop trying to feed a family to be paying out anything substantial but I could PayPal a cup of coffee or something for their trouble. But then I had a few dealings with complete shady assholes who tried to extort money out of me by threatening to exploit what they had found and go public and basically drag my reputation through the mud. Experiences with the latter group make me sympathize a lot more with companies that decide to have a policy of just blanket not dealing with outside security researchers, to take the information and then deal with the fixes internally and quietly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nicolasmontone](user?id=nicolasmontone) [3 months ago](item?id=41602510)   | [parent](#41602446) | [prev](#41603195) | [next](#41603518) [–]  This is 100% company culture, probably the ones that decide this kind of things are not technical or don't understand how important is this. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ggregoire](user?id=ggregoire) [3 months ago](item?id=41603413)   | [root](#41602446) | [parent](#41602510) | [next](#41603518) [–]  They disclosed the vulnerability directly to the co-founder CTO. > the timeline for the vulnerability: > aug 25 5:48pm: got initial contact over signal (encrypted) with arc co-founder hursh > aug 25 6:02pm: vulnerability poc executed on hursh's arc account | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ilrwbwrkhv](user?id=ilrwbwrkhv) [3 months ago](item?id=41603518)   | [parent](#41602446) | [prev](#41602510) | [next](#41602113) [3 more]  [flagged] | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [currymj](user?id=currymj) [3 months ago](item?id=41603543)   | [root](#41602446) | [parent](#41603518) | [next](#41602113) [–]  Arc is a great product, it's the nicest web browser to use, you can tell these people are really good at their jobs in many respects (though apparently not security?!?). probably a lot of investors saw that too and are willing to fund a very strong team with the hope of eventual product-market fit. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ilrwbwrkhv](user?id=ilrwbwrkhv) [3 months ago](item?id=41605486)   | [root](#41602446) | [parent](#41603543) | [next](#41602113) [–]  That's one explanation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mcpar-land](user?id=mcpar-land) [3 months ago](item?id=41602113)   | [prev](#41602446) | [next](#41599794) [–]  Every single thing I've heard about Arc browser has been a massive red flag.

My current understanding is that comments with little substance are totally acceptable provided they're good natured. For example this comment by dang "There's nothing wrong with submitting a comment saying just "Thanks."" <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37251836>. Also from the guidelines "Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive": this post's topic doesn't likely qualify as divisive. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Insanity](user?id=Insanity) [3 months ago](item?id=41604225)   | [prev](#41598000) [–]  Damn, that is bad. While I enjoyed reading through the write-up, I think a "summary section" at the top would have benefited me lol.
