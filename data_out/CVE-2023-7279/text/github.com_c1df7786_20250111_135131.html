### @Starkteetje **[Starkteetje](/Starkteetje)** commented [Nov 28, 2023](#issue-2014060501)

Fixes a RE DoS in Connaisseur

## Description

This MR contains multiple commits. One fixes a RE DoS in Connaisseur's validation of TUF data. Another improves the conceptually (but technically unrelated) handling of timeouts of asynchronous function calls. The remaining commits handle a new type of commit header, which will allow us to automatically publish the Helm charts with a sec release annotation.

## Checklist

* PR is rebased to/aimed at branch `develop`
* PR follows [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/sse-secure-systems/connaisseur/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Added tests (if necessary)
* Extended README/Documentation (if necessary)
* Adjusted versions of image and Helm chart in `Chart.yaml` (if necessary)

Sorry, something went wrong.

This commit fixes a regular expression denial of service vulnerability that was present during the schema validation of the targets.json TUF file in a Notary validation. An adversary with the ability to alter Notary responses, in particular an evil Notary server, could have provided Connaisseur with a malformed targets.json, which would have led to catastrophic (exponential) backtracking during regex matching. Exploitability was contingent on the presence of a notaryv1 validator in the Connaisseur configuration, which is the default as both DockerHub's and Connaisseur's Notary root keys are present in the default values.yaml.")`
