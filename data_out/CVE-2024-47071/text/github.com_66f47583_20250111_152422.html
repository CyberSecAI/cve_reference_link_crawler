# OSS Endpoint Manager module activation can allow authenticated web users unauthorized access to read system files with the permissions of the webserver process

Moderate

[chrsmj](/chrsmj)
published

## Package

OSS Endpoint Manager
(FreePBX-ContributedModules)

## Affected versions

<= 14.0.3

## Patched versions

14.0.4

## Description

### Summary

Allow download of any file from the server that freepbx has access to, while logged in to the web GUI with a user who has access to the Endpointman OSS module, if the module is installed and was previously used to export some of its related data (eg. using "Export Brand Packages" under its Advanced Settings) or a specific "export" directory was previously made on the filesystem in a specific location by some other process.

### Details

Login to freepbx. Activate and use the OSS Endpoint Manager module to export some brand packages.

Then, if we use the following URL, modifying file\_package with the path of the file to download, it would be enough:

> <http://server/admin/config.php?display=epm_advanced&subpage=manual_upload&command=export_brands_availables_file&file_package=../../../../../../../../etc/freepbx.conf>

Problem file and line:

<https://github.com/FreePBX-ContributedModules/endpointman/blob/7ee3571fad7a067e0d1beaeb5e5a0a16b6da55fa/Endpointman_Advanced.class.php#L1054>

Fix:

```
$dget['file_package'] = basename($_REQUEST['file_package']);
$path_tmp_file = $this->PHONE_MODULES_PATH."/temp/export/".$dget['file_package'];
```
### PoC

Install Module Endpointman OSS and activate it and export a brand.

### Impact

Security data leak and affects all systems that have the module installed and were used to Export a Brand Package. The affected version of the module as published in FreePBX-ContributedModules repo is installable on FreePBX v14 and v15, but not v16 nor v17 due to PHP version changes; however, forks of the module with this bug are known to be out in the wild, and so this issue may affect your system.

### Patch to Fix

If you are on FreePBX v14 or v15, you can upgrade to OSS endpointmain version 14.0.4 at <https://github.com/FreePBX-ContributedModules/endpointman>

Other versions - please contact your fork maintainer.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
