# Cookie Share In WebView

## Description

* In the mini program, data can be shared between the web-view and the mini-program through the specified interface.
* Therefore, when a certain mini-program sends privacy to the H5 page embedded in the web-view component, and the privacy message is saved as a cookie by the H5 page, when other mini-programs also embed H5 under the same domain in the web-view. When the user enters H5 under the same domain in the web-view of other mini-programs, even if the user has not logged in, the cookie will be shared between the two mini-programs. the user's login status can also be obtained through cookies to track user behavior.
* At the same time, through the specified interface, the mini-program can also obtain cookie messages from the H5 page in the web-view.
* As shown below

## Analysis

* We found that in WeChat, although there is an independent sandbox for each mini-program and the internal data storage is independent of each other, this is not the case in the web-view component. We found that cookies in web-view are saved in a shared file, which is the Cookies.binarycookies file located in the '/Library/Cookies/' path in the WeChat directory(In the iOS system). Cookies in different web-view components of different mini-programs are also saved in this file, resulting in a shared situation

## POC

* We designed the following experiment to demonstrate how cookies can be passed between pages within a mini-program and in a web-view
  We choose to use URL concatenation to pass data into the web-view, and then save this data as a cookie. Using the functions provided by the web-view component, we can pass the data from the web-view to the mini-program.
  The Miniprogram folder is our mini-program sample file, and the PageInWebView folder is the H5 page sample file in the web-view component

  + Cookies saved in web-view

  + The data passed into the mini-program from the web-view
    [![alt text](/yikaikkk/CookieShareInWebView/raw/master/static/DataInPost.png)](/yikaikkk/CookieShareInWebView/blob/master/static/DataInPost.png)

As analyzed above, cookies are not completely isolated between mini-programs. If two mini-programs use web-view to embed H5 pages under a certain domain name, and one mini-program saves information related to user privacy in the form of a cookie under the domain name after authorization, then the mini-program that embeds the pages under the domain name in the web-view component can obtain the user privacy information saved in the cookie without the user and the super app noticing, thereby bypassing the authentication mechanism of the super app

## Example

* We have found a case of cookie sharing in the mini-program ecosystem, as shown in the following figure
  When we authorized login in the JD shopping mini-program and entered the web view page of the current mini-program while capturing packets, we found that there were jdpin and other cookie fields representing the username in the cookie
  [![alt text](/yikaikkk/CookieShareInWebView/raw/master/static/image.png)](/yikaikkk/CookieShareInWebView/blob/master/static/image.png)
* However, when we enter the JD Home mini-program and enter a certain web view page without logging in, we can find through packet capture that even without logging in, the mini-program can still bypass the authorization process in the super app by using cookies in the web view component to obtain the user's username and other information from other mini-programs
