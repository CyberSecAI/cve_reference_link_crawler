      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "This content discusses a new vulnerability discovered by Matousec that affects multiple internet security products. The vulnerability involves bypassing certain security sensors using a specific technique. It highlights that existing malware detections are unaffected but new malware using this technique may bypass some protection layers. It also emphasizes the importance of multi-layered defense.",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is based on a technique that bypasses specific sensors and generic detection engines, allowing unknown malware to potentially execute undetected.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Bypass of security sensors and generic detection engines"
        ],
        "impact": "New, unknown malware could bypass some layers of detection and potentially execute on systems. This could lead to malware infection and further compromise.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "New, unknown malware using the specific bypass technique."

      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "This article describes a vulnerability dubbed the 'argument-switch' attack, discovered by matousec.com, which bypasses anti-virus protections by exploiting driver hooks within the Windows OS. The technique involves substituting a benign code sample with a malicious payload just before execution. The vulnerability affects AV products using SSDT hooks, potentially allowing malware to install itself and remove the AV software, even with limited user privileges. The attack relies on precise timing and is more reliable on multi-core processors due to thread race conditions.",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The root cause is the exploitation of System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks used by anti-virus software. By switching a benign code sample with malicious code just before execution, the AV is bypassed.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Exploitation of driver hooks (SSDT hooks) in Windows OS.",
          "Race condition on multi-core processors.",
          "Vulnerability in AV software that relies on SSDT or similar kernel-mode hooks for security features."
        ],
        "impact": "Malware can bypass anti-virus protection and install itself, potentially removing the AV software. This allows an attacker to completely compromise the system. The attack can also be used to kill an AV running under a user account without administrative privileges.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Executing a binary with a malicious payload.",
          "Exploiting another software vulnerability (e.g., Adobe Reader, Java) to inject the malicious payload.",
           "Malware uses a specific 'argument-switch' technique."
        ],
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run a binary on the target PC. This can be achieved by directly executing a malicious binary, or via exploiting other vulnerabilities (e.g., in Adobe Reader or Java) to deliver and execute the malicious payload."
