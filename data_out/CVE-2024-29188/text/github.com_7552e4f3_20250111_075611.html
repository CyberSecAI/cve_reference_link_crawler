This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Don't follow junctions when recursing directories.

```
When deleting directories recursively, an elevated custom action
following junctions in a user-writable location could recurse into
any directory, including some that you might not want to be deleted.
Therefore, avoid recursing into directories that are actually
junctions (aka "reparse points").

This applies to:

- The RemoveFoldersEx custom action (which doesn't actually do deletions
but would instruct elevated MSI to delete on your behalf).
- DTF's custom action runner.
```
