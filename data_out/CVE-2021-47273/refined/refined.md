Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a NULL pointer dereference in the `dwc3-meson-g12a` USB driver.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability occurs when only the PHY1 is used, and the regmap initialization code does not initialize the PHY1 regmap entry. Instead, it incorrectly uses the USB2 ports, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to access the uninitialized PHY1 regmap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A NULL pointer dereference exists in the `dwc3_meson_g12a_usb2_init_phy` function. This occurs because the code attempts to access a regmap that has not been properly initialized.
- The code incorrectly iterates through USB2 ports based on `priv->usb2_ports` instead of checking the phy names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The system crashes due to a kernel NULL pointer dereference.
- The USB functionality might fail.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during device initialization when a system is configured to use only the PHY1.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special capabilities, this is a bug within the driver code itself. The user needs to be using the affected driver and have a device configuration that triggers the vulnerability (e.g., using only PHY1).

The patch fixes this issue by:
- Iterating through all available physical layers(`priv->drvdata->num_phys`).
- Checking if the phy name contains "usb2" before initializing the regmap.
- Skipping non-usb2 phys.

This ensures that the correct regmap entry for PHY1 is initialized when PHY0 is disabled, preventing the NULL pointer dereference and system crash.
