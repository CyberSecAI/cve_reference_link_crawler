### @idyll **[idyll](/idyll)** commented [Jan 29, 2024](#issue-2105982513)

A `Samly.Assertion` cached in ETS or the Session will eventually expire.

`Samly.State.Store.get_assertion/3` will return currently expired sessions. This is problematic because the `Samly.AuthHandler` looks for the cached session and doesn't replace it even if it is expired.

This is further exacerbated by `Samly.get_active_assertion/1` returning expired assertions.

To address this I've updated the session and ETS logic to no longer return an expired session.

I contemplated purging ETS based on time, but it's most likely that the session store is being used in production.

Sorry, something went wrong.
