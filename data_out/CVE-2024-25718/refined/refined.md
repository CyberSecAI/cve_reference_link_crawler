    "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the samly Elixir library related to session management. Specifically, the library was not properly checking the expiration of cached SAML assertions, leading to the possibility of using expired sessions. This issue was addressed by modifying the session and ETS logic to validate the expiration time of assertions before returning them. The vulnerability affects applications using the samly library for SAML single sign-on authentication.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `Samly.State.Store.get_assertion/3` function in the `samly` library did not check if a cached SAML assertion was expired before returning it. This allowed expired sessions to be used.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The library's session management logic failed to validate the expiration of cached SAML assertions.",
        "The `Samly.AuthHandler` did not replace expired cached sessions.",
        "`Samly.get_active_assertion/1` could return expired assertions."
      ],
      "impact": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to resources by reusing an expired SAML session. If an expired session is not invalidated, the application may grant access to a user who is no longer authenticated.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by reusing a session that has already expired, potentially gaining access to protected resources.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to obtain a valid session token and wait for the assertion to expire. Then, the attacker can attempt to reuse the expired token by attempting to access the protected resources. No special privileges or positions are needed, other than to be a valid user previously authenticated with a SAML provider."
