  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the MySQL server and client components related to the Optimizer, InnoDB, replication, security privileges, DDL, DML, and stored procedures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Memory corruption",
        "Use of vulnerable third-party components (e.g., SQLite, Apache Commons BeanUtils, OpenSSL)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server. Arbitrary code execution is also possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks via MySQL protocol",
      "Local attacks",
      "HTTP/HTTPS",
      "IIOP/T3"

    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker may require high privileges, valid user accounts, or may exploit vulnerabilities remotely without authentication depending on the specific flaw. For some vulnerabilities, adjacent network access is sufficient. Exploitation of some vulnerabilities is limited to local attacks."
