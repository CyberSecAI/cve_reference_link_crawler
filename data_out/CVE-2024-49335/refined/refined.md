- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GoogleDrive folder list plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or control within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request without their knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into performing an action via a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application, but the victim must be.
