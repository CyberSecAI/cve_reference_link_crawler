Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2024-25526:

**Summary:**

The provided document details numerous SQL injection, XSS and information disclosure vulnerabilities within the RuvarOA system. The identified issues stem from insecure handling of user-provided data and system design flaws.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The document lists 29 instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities across various `.aspx` pages. The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (obtained from `Request.QueryString` or POST parameters) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. These vulnerabilities are present in the following files (not exhaustive):
    *   `/WorkPlan/plan_template_preview.aspx`
    *   `/bulletin/bulletin_template_show.aspx`
    *   `/Mobile/WorkFlow/wf_file_download.aspx`
    *   `/AddressBook/address_public_show.aspx`
    *   `/AddressBook/address_public_new.aspx`
    *   `/CorporateCulture/kaizen_download.aspx`
    *   `/Mobile/Bulletin/AttachDownLoad.aspx`
    *   `/Mobile/LHMail/AttachDown.aspx`
     *   `/Mobile/WorkFlow/wf_work_finish_file_down.aspx`
    *   `/SysManage/wf_template_child_field_list.aspx`
     *   `/SysManage/sys_blogtemplate_new.aspx`
    *   `/WebUtility/MF.aspx`
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_work_print.aspx`
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_get_fields_approve.aspx`
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_work_form_save.aspx`
    *   `/WorkPlan/WorkPlanAttachDownLoad.aspx`
    *   `/filemanage/file_memo.aspx`
    *   `/ContractManage/get_company.aspx`
    *   `/PersonalAffair/worklog_template_show.aspx`
    *   `/ProjectManage/pm_gatt_inc.aspx`
    *    `/WorkFlow/OfficeFileDownload.aspx`
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_work_stat_setting.aspx`
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_office_file_history_show.aspx`
    *   `/WebUtility/SearchCondiction.aspx`
     *   `/WebUtility/get_find_condiction.aspx`
    *   `/include/get_dict.aspx`

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several instances of XSS vulnerabilities are identified, all due to the insecure output of user-controlled parameters within the application's responses:
    *   `/SysManage/emailset_outside.aspx`
    *   `/WebUtility/common_new_top.aspx`
    *   `/WebUtility/common_show.aspx`
    *   `/WebUtility/common_show_top.aspx`
    *   `/WebUtility/common_deal.aspx`
    *   `/WebUtility/common_deal_top.aspx`
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_work_print.aspx`

*   **Information Leakage:** The document highlights that error messages can expose the website's physical path. This is further exacerbated when SQL injection vulnerabilities are present because, combined, they could allow a threat actor to gain shell access on the server.
    *   `/WorkFlow/OfficeFileUpdate.aspx` and `/asset/asset_file_search_left.aspx` show error messages that reveal physical paths.
     * The application logs are stored in `/logfiles/` using a year/month/day `.txt` naming convention.

*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** The ability to download arbitrary attachments is mentioned by manipulating the `contentid` or `email_attach_id` parameters in `/Mobile/LHMail/AttachDown.aspx`, highlighting insufficient access control for attachments.

*   **System Design Flaw:**  The existence of `/WebUtility/dSql.aspx`, is a design flaw that allows unauthorized users to generate SQL scripts, further enabling potential malicious activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the application.
    *   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server if combined with other vulnerabilities (file upload or write).
*   **XSS:** Exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser.
    *   Steal session cookies.
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   Deface websites.
*   **Information Leakage:**  Exposure of sensitive information like website paths, internal configurations, and potential for system compromise when combined with SQL injection.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Downloading arbitrary files gives access to sensitive attachments.
*   **System Design Flaw:**  Abuse of `/WebUtility/dSql.aspx` can allow malicious manipulation of the database, bypassing typical security mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** All identified vulnerabilities can be exploited through crafted HTTP GET or POST requests.
*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection flaws by directly manipulating query string parameters or POST data.
*   **Malicious Payloads:** Attackers could use malicious JavaScript in XSS attacks via manipulated URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the web application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  Knowledge of how to craft HTTP requests, manipulate query parameters, and POST data is necessary.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** Basic SQL knowledge is needed to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities to construct malicious payloads for database interaction.
*   **JavaScript Knowledge:** Basic understanding of Javascript to exploit XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description. It provides the vulnerable code locations, the methods for exploiting the flaws, as well as specific examples.

**Conclusion:**

The content reveals a significant number of severe vulnerabilities, mainly SQL injection, in the RUVAROA system, alongside other vulnerabilities such as XSS, information leakage, and system design flaws. These issues could potentially allow an attacker to gain full control of the system, steal sensitive information, and cause significant damage.
