- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unspecified O3C (likely related to Axis' cloud services) feature may expose sensitive traffic between an Axis device (client) and the O3C server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive network traffic.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access or interception of sensitive data transmitted between the Axis device and the O3C server.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the communication channel between the Axis device and the O3C server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to intercept network traffic or position themselves to eavesdrop on the communication between the Axis device and the O3C server. The attacker needs to be on a network path between device and cloud.
