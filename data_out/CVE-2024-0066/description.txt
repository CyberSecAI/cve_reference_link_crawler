Johan Fagerström, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program, has found that a O3C feature may expose sensitive traffic between the client (Axis device) and (O3C) server. If O3C is not being used this flaw does not apply. 
Axis has released patched AXIS OS versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and solution.
