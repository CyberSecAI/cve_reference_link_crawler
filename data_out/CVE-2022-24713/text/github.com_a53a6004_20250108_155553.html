## Package

cargo

regex
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 1.5.5

## Patched versions

1.5.5

## Description

> This is a cross-post of [the official security advisory](https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/NcNNL1Jq7Yw). The official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.

The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `regex` crate did not properly limit the complexity of the regular expressions (regex) it parses. An attacker could use this security issue to perform a denial of service, by sending a specially crafted regex to a service accepting untrusted regexes. No known vulnerability is present when parsing untrusted input with trusted regexes.

This issue has been assigned [CVE-2022-24713](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8 "CVE-2022-24713"). The severity of this vulnerability is "high" when the `regex` crate is used to parse untrusted regexes. Other uses of the `regex` crate are not affected by this vulnerability.

## Overview

The `regex` crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API.

Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes.

## Affected versions

All versions of the `regex` crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from `regex` 1.5.5.

## Mitigations

We recommend everyone accepting user-controlled regexes to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the `regex` crate.

Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, we do not recommend denying known problematic regexes.

## Acknowledgements

We want to thank Addison Crump for responsibly disclosing this to us according to the [Rust security policy](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security), and for helping review the fix.

We also want to thank Andrew Gallant for developing the fix, and Pietro Albini for coordinating the disclosure and writing this advisory.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
