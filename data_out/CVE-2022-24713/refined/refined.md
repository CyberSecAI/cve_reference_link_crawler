Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24713:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content consistently refers to CVE-2022-24713 and describes a vulnerability in the `regex` crate for Rust. This aligns with the CVE ID and its description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The `regex` crate had a flaw in its mitigations against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks during regex parsing.
   - Specifically, the mitigations failed to account for the computational cost of compiling regexes with large repetitions of empty sub-expressions. Empty sub-expressions don't consume memory, so the usual size limits were not triggered, leading to excessive CPU usage during parsing.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Inadequate Mitigation:** The crate's size-limiting mechanism for regex compilation was bypassed by regexes with large repetitions of empty sub-expressions.
   - **Unbounded Resource Consumption:** The regex compiler could be made to consume excessive CPU time by compiling a large number of empty sub-expressions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could craft a malicious regex and send it to a service using the vulnerable `regex` crate, causing the service to become unresponsive due to excessive resource consumption during parsing.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted regexes over a network to a service that uses the vulnerable library and accepts user-provided regexes.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
   - **Ability to Send Untrusted Regexes:** The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted regex strings to a service that uses the vulnerable `regex` crate.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the `regex` crate handles empty sub-expressions. These sub-expressions do not add to the memory footprint of the compiled regex, causing the size limit checks to fail, leading to excessive compilation time.
*   The fix adds a "fake" memory cost for each empty sub-expression, which correctly triggers the size limit and prevents the excessive CPU usage.
*   The vulnerable code is in the `compile.rs` file. The fix adds the following line:
    `self.extra_inst_bytes += std::mem::size_of::<Inst>();`
    to the `c_empty` function. This line adds a "fake" memory cost when compiling empty sub-expressions.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "high" severity when the `regex` crate is used to parse untrusted regexes.
*   The fix was included in version 1.5.5 of the `regex` crate.
*   The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Addison Crump.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2022-24713.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked as GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-400 and CWE-1333.
