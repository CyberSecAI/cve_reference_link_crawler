# Regexes with large repetitions on empty sub-expressions take a very long time to parse

High

[pietroalbini](/pietroalbini)
published
GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8
Mar 8, 2022

## Package

cargo

regex
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<=1.5.4

## Patched versions

1.5.5

## Description

> This is a cross-post of [the official security advisory](https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/NcNNL1Jq7Yw). The official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.

The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `regex` crate did not properly limit the complexity of the regular expressions (regex) it parses. An attacker could use this security issue to perform a denial of service, by sending a specially crafted regex to a service accepting untrusted regexes. No known vulnerability is present when parsing untrusted input with trusted regexes.

This issue has been assigned [CVE-2022-24713](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8 "CVE-2022-24713"). The severity of this vulnerability is "high" when the `regex` crate is used to parse untrusted regexes. Other uses of the `regex` crate are not affected by this vulnerability.

## Overview

The `regex` crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API.

Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes.

## Affected versions

All versions of the `regex` crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from `regex` 1.5.5.

## Mitigations

We recommend everyone accepting user-controlled regexes to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the `regex` crate.

Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, we do not recommend denying known problematic regexes.

## Acknowledgements

We want to thank Addison Crump for responsibly disclosing this to us according to the [Rust security policy](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security), and for helping review the fix.

We also want to thank Andrew Gallant for developing the fix, and Pietro Albini for coordinating the disclosure and writing this advisory.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

security: fix denial-of-service bug in compiler

```
The regex compiler will happily attempt to compile '(?:){294967295}' by
compiling the empty sub-expression 294,967,295 times. Empty
sub-expressions don't use any memory in the current implementation, so
this doesn't trigger the pre-existing machinery for stopping compilation
early if the regex object gets too big. The end result is that while
compilation will eventually succeed, it takes a very long time to do so.

In this commit, we fix this problem by adding a fake amount of memory
every time we compile an empty sub-expression. It turns out we were
already tracking an additional amount of indirect heap usage via
'extra_inst_bytes' in the compiler, so we just make it look like
compiling an empty sub-expression actually adds an additional 'Inst' to
the compiled regex object.

This has the effect of causing the regex compiler to reject this sort of
regex in a reasonable amount of time by default.

Many thanks to @VTCAKAVSMoACE for reporting this, providing the valuable
test cases and continuing to test this patch as it was developed.

|  |  | // |
|  |  | // At the time this test was written, the regex compiler does not represent |
|  |  | // empty sub-expressions with any bytecode instructions. In effect, it's an |
|  |  | // "optimization" to leave them out, since they would otherwise correspond |
|  |  | // to an unconditional JUMP in the regex bytecode (i.e., an unconditional |
|  |  | // epsilon transition in the NFA graph). Therefore, an empty sub-expression |
|  |  | // represents an interesting case for the compiler's size limits. Since it |
|  |  | // doesn't actually contribute any additional memory to the compiled regex |
|  |  | // instructions, the size limit machinery never detects it. Instead, it just |
|  |  | // dumbly tries to compile the empty sub-expression N times, where N is the |
|  |  | // repetition size. |
|  |  | // |
|  |  | // When N is very large, this will cause the compiler to essentially spin and |
|  |  | // do nothing for a decently large amount of time. It causes the regex to take |
|  |  | // quite a bit of time to compile, despite the concrete syntax of the regex |
|  |  | // being quite small. |

|  |  | // The degree to which this is actually a problem is somewhat of a judgment |

|  |  | // should be able to reasonably control this by setting lower or higher size |
|  |  | // limits on the compiled object size. But this mitigation doesn't work at all |

## Package

cargo

regex
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 1.5.5

## Patched versions

1.5.5

## Description

> This is a cross-post of [the official security advisory](https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/NcNNL1Jq7Yw). The official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.

The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `regex` crate did not properly limit the complexity of the regular expressions (regex) it parses. An attacker could use this security issue to perform a denial of service, by sending a specially crafted regex to a service accepting untrusted regexes. No known vulnerability is present when parsing untrusted input with trusted regexes.

This issue has been assigned [CVE-2022-24713](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8 "CVE-2022-24713"). The severity of this vulnerability is "high" when the `regex` crate is used to parse untrusted regexes. Other uses of the `regex` crate are not affected by this vulnerability.

## Overview

The `regex` crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API.

Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes.

## Affected versions

All versions of the `regex` crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from `regex` 1.5.5.

## Mitigations

We recommend everyone accepting user-controlled regexes to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the `regex` crate.

Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, we do not recommend denying known problematic regexes.

## Acknowledgements

We want to thank Addison Crump for responsibly disclosing this to us according to the [Rust security policy](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security), and for helping review the fix.

We also want to thank Andrew Gallant for developing the fix, and Pietro Albini for coordinating the disclosure and writing this advisory.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Hash: SHA512

The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `regex` crate did not

properly limit the complexity of the regular expressions (regex) it parses. An

attacker could use this security issue to perform a denial of service, by

sending a specially crafted regex to a service accepting untrusted regexes. No

known vulnerability is present when parsing untrusted input with trusted

regexes.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2022-24713. The severity of this vulnerability

is "high" when the `regex` crate is used to parse untrusted regexes. Other uses

of the `regex` crate are not affected by this vulnerability.

## Overview

The `regex` crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service

attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted

regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent

attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's

API.

Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent

untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's

possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible

to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to

services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes.

## Affected versions

All versions of the `regex` crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this

issue. The fix is include starting from `regex` 1.5.5.

## Mitigations

We recommend everyone accepting user-controlled regexes to upgrade immediately

to the latest version of the `regex` crate.

Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are

practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this

vulnerability. Because of this, we do not recommend denying known problematic

regexes.
