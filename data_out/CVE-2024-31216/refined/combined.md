# Azure Storage SAS token leakage into logs on connection errors

Moderate

[stefanprodan](/stefanprodan)
published
GHSA-v554-xwgw-hc3w
May 15, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/fluxcd/source-controller
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.5

## Patched versions

1.2.5

## Description

### Impact

When source-controller is configured to use an [Azure SAS token](https://v2-2.docs.fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/#azure-blob-sas-token-example) when connecting to Azure Blob Storage, the token was logged along with the Azure URL when the controller encountered a connection error. An attacker with access to the source-controller logs could use the token to gain access to the Azure Blob Storage until the token expires.

### Patches

This vulnerability was fixed in source-controller **v1.2.5**.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround for this vulnerability except for using a different auth mechanism such as [Azure Workload Identity](https://v2-2.docs.fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/#azure).

### Credits

This issue was reported and fixed by Jagpreet Singh Tamber ([@jagpreetstamber](https://github.com/jagpreetstamber)) from the Azure Arc team.

### References

[#1430](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/pull/1430)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This PR removes the Bucket object's URL query strings from logged error messages as the query strings can contain sensitive information.
