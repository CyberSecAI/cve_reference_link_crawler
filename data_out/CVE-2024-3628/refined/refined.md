- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EasyEvent plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will be executed when a user visits the page, potentially leading to account takeover or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user such as an administrator in order to access plugin settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator-level access or equivalent privileges to access the plugin settings and inject the malicious payload.
