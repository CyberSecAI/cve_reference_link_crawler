- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially crafted URL can cause a directory traversal in the Salt file server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient validation of file paths after URL translation in the Salt file server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the Salt master's file system.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted URL is used to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability in the Salt file server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Salt master. It is indicated that low privileges are sufficient.
