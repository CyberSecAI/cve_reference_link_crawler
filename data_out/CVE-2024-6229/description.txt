A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 'Upload Knowledge' feature of stangirard/quivr, affecting the latest version. Users can upload files via URL, which allows the insertion of malicious JavaScript payloads. These payloads are stored on the server and executed whenever any user clicks on a link containing the payload, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, and reputation damage.
