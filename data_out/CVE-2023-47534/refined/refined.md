- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection [CWE-1236]. The application fails to properly sanitize log entries that are later exported to a CSV file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the admin workstation by crafting malicious log entries. When an administrator downloads and opens the log file using software such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, these programs may interpret the injected malicious content as commands.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends crafted requests to the FortiClientEMS server which are logged by the server. When the administrator downloads and opens the server logs as a CSV file, the injected commands are executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to send network requests to the vulnerable FortiClientEMS server and cause it to generate logs with crafted content. The attacker is unauthenticated. The attack requires user interaction by an administrator who opens the crafted log file.
