Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** A low-privileged user can inject a malicious payload through Scheduled Views. This payload is then executed as JavaScript code in another user's browser when they access the affected scheduled view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw (CWE-79). The malicious script is stored within the scheduled view configuration and is executed each time a user interacts with that view.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the input provided when creating or updating Scheduled Views, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of a user interacting with the compromised Scheduled View. This can lead to various malicious actions.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover/Data Theft:** Depending on the injected JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal user session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect the user to malicious sites, or access sensitive information visible within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Scheduled Views:** The primary attack vector is through the Scheduled Views feature of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform.
*   **Crafted Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JavaScript payload that will be injected into a Scheduled View.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs a low-privileged user account on Splunk instance that does not hold the "admin" or "power" roles.
*   **Access to Scheduled View Creation/Modification:** The attacker needs to have the permission to create or modify scheduled views.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince or cause a victim user to access the malicious scheduled view so that the injected JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory provides a CVSS score of 5.4 (Medium), vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   The advisory and detection rules confirm the vulnerability affects Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.3 and 9.1.6, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.2.2403.
*   The advisory suggests upgrading to version 9.3.0, 9.2.3, or 9.1.6 (or higher for Enterprise), or 9.2.2403.100 for Cloud Platform.
*   Disabling Splunk Web is suggested as a workaround, if feasible
*  Splunk provides a detection search that uses Splunk logs to detect usage of the vulnerable functionality.
