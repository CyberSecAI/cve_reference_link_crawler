# Detection: Splunk Persistent XSS via Scheduled Views

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: d4f55f7c-6518-4122-a197-951fe0f21b25
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.3 and 9.1.6 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2308.211, a low-privileged user that does not hold the âadminâ or âpowerâ Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through Scheduled Views that could result in execution of unauthorized JavaScript code in the browser of a user.

### Search

```
1`splunkd_ui` method=POST uri=*/scheduledview/search/update*
2
3| stats  count earliest(_time) as firstTime  latest(_time) as lastTime values(bytes) AS bytes values(uri) AS uri values(useragent) AS user_agent by clientip user host
4
5| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
6
7| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
8
9| `splunk_persistent_xss_via_scheduled_views_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_persistent\_xss\_via\_scheduled\_views\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_persistent_xss_via_scheduled_views_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to REST API.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search, it is not possible to detect XSS payload from the scheduled view, however it is possible to see who was sent the scheduled search in order to trigger potential XSS.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible XSS against $host$ please investigate further | 10 | 20 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
