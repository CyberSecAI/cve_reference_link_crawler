### @robert-scheck **[robert-scheck](/robert-scheck)** commented [Jan 13, 2023](#issue-1532521901) • edited Loading

Please use at least the correct command name: `zmprov`. Meanwhile this advisory is also known as [CVE-2022-32294](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-32294).

Aside of this, I'm *unable* to reproduce the issue. And unfortunately your description how to reproduce this possible security flaw is incomplete. Based on the official Zimbra administration guidelines, I assumed the following steps:

1. assumed step:

```
# su - zimbra
$ zmprov ca tux@example.net ""
5db256d6-9bdc-45ac-b2da-04bd42018406
$

```

2. assumed step: Initial random password should be revealed in `/var/log/secure` (RHEL/Rocky Linux, or where ever `sudo` calls are logged) – but `zmprov` by itself does not call `sudo` at all, and I can *not* find any hint about a password for my above example user `tux@example.net` in any syslog file or elsewhere within the syslog stack.

Further on: *If* this security flaw really exists, but was just accidentially described incompletely, it mainly applies by default only to Zimbra multi-server setups with remote syslog, or to regular setups with manually configured remote syslog. On default Zimbra single-server setups without any manually configured remote syslog, the password is *not* transmitted to foreign systems.

Most likely the `sudo` calls in your screenshot (copied in below) are caused by a third-party application, but not by Zimbra.

Sorry, something went wrong.
