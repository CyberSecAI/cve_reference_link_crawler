Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-29719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect content type being specified in a web response by IBM Cognos Analytics.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Content-Type:** The server is not properly specifying the content type in the web response. This may allow a client to misinterpret the response potentially leading to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Client-Side Vulnerabilities:** The primary impact is the potential for client-side vulnerabilities. The incorrect content type could lead to the browser misinterpreting the response and executing unintended actions
