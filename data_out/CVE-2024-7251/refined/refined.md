Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `cmdagent` executable in Comodo Internet Security Pro. It is caused by the ability of a local attacker to create a symbolic link which then the `cmdagent` abuses to create a file in an arbitrary location due to the program's lack of proper input sanitization or permission checks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is a link-following vulnerability within the `cmdagent` executable. The application does not properly handle symbolic links, allowing an attacker to redirect file creation operations.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This allows them to take complete control of the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. Once achieved, they can create a symbolic link that when accessed by cmdagent causes it to create a file in an attacker controlled location allowing for privilege escalation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a foothold on the system, with the ability to execute low-privileged code.
    *   The attacker must be able to create symbolic links.

This content provides more detail than the official CVE description by explaining the attack vector and the vulnerable component (`cmdagent` executable). It also specifies the method of exploitation using a symbolic link, and the result of successful exploitation, which is privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.
