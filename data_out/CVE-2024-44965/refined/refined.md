Based on the provided information, the content is related to the following CVE: CVE-2024-44965.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `pti_clone_pgtable()` function in the Linux kernel's x86 architecture had incorrect alignment assumptions when cloning page tables, specifically assuming that the start address was always PMD aligned. This assumption is valid for x86_64, but not for i386.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect alignment assumptions in `pti_clone_pgtable()`
- The function uses an incorrect address increment, leading to a 'short' clone.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Dodgy crashes on i386-nosmp builds using GCC-11, characterized by endless traps until entry stack exhaustion and then a #DF from the stack guard.
- A 'short' clone of the page table can cause the user mapping to have a short copy of the entry text, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when the kernel clones page tables during the process of setting up user mappings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to trigger a page table clone operation.
- The attacker must be using a vulnerable kernel on an i386 architecture.

**More details:**
The fix replaces `addr += PMD_SIZE` and `addr += PAGE_SIZE` with `addr = round_up(addr + 1, PMD_SIZE)` and `addr = round_up(addr + 1, PAGE_SIZE)` to ensure correct address increments and avoid alignment issues.
The vulnerability is fixed by commit `41e71dbb0e0a0fe214545fe64af031303a08524c` and backported to stable branches.
