Subject: CVE-2024-29733: Apache Airflow FTP Provider: FTP_TLS instance with
 unverified SSL context

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow FTP Provider before 3.7.0

Description:

Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in Apache Airflow FTP Provider.

The FTP hook lacks complete certificate validation in FTP_TLS connections, which can potentially be leveraged. Implementing proper certificate validation by passing context=ssl.create_default_context() during FTP_TLS instantiation is used as mitigation to validate the certificates properly.

This issue affects Apache Airflow FTP Provider: before 3.7.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.7.0, which fixes the issue.
