Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `fsicapd` component of F-Secure Atlant. This component, used in certain F-Secure/WithSecure products, consumes excessive memory when scanning large or fuzzed files. This excessive memory consumption can lead to the scanning engine crashing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a denial-of-service, caused by uncontrolled memory consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Scanning engine crash:** Successful exploitation results in the crash of the scanning engine within the affected F-Secure/WithSecure product. This would disrupt the security functionality of the product.
- **Service Disruption:**  The crash leads to a denial of service, rendering the product's scanning feature unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the system.
- **Malicious Files/Packages:** The attack is triggered by sending specially crafted large or fuzzed files or packages to be scanned by the affected product.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send data to a system running a vulnerable F-Secure/WithSecure product, implying network access to the target system.
- **Ability to send files for scanning:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious files/packages that trigger the vulnerability to the product being scanned.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects various F-Secure/WithSecure endpoint protection products on Windows and Mac, as well as F-Secure Linux Security (32-bit), F-Secure Linux Security 64, F-Secure Atlant, F-Secure Internet Gatekeeper, F-Secure Cloud Protection for Salesforce, and F-Secure Elements for Microsoft 365.
- **Fix:** A fix for this vulnerability was released through an automatic update channel (HydraLinux update 2022-04-12_01). No user action is required.
- **Reported Through:** The vulnerability was reported through the Vulnerability Reward Program.
- **No Known Exploitation:** As of the date of the advisory (2022-04-25), there were no known instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.
- **Credits:** The discovery of this issue is credited to Antti Levom√§ki and Christian Jalio from Forcepoint.
