Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the URL. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates the user-provided `id` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Information Leakage:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name, as demonstrated by the provided payload that uses `updatexml` to leak the `database()`.
- **Potential for Full Database compromise:** Depending on database permissions and other vulnerabilities, attackers might also gain ability to read, modify or delete database information, potentially leading to a full database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the URL parameter `id` in the endpoint `/mpms/?p=services/view_service&id=`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No specific user role is required to exploit the vulnerability, indicating it's likely exploitable by anyone with network access to the application.

**Additional details:**

- The provided content includes a specific payload to exploit the vulnerability, targeting the `id` parameter of `/mpms/?p=services/view_service`.
- The payload demonstrates how to use the `updatexml` function to leak the database name, but other SQL injection techniques could also be used to further compromise the application.
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Packers and Movers Management System v1.0 by oretnom23."
- The specific vulnerable file is `/mpms/?p=services/view_service`.
