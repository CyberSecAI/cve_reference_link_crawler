- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of role permissions in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a user with a custom read-only role to perform a write operation on the affected part of the web-based management interface, which should be restricted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to modify certain parts of the configuration, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through the web-based management interface of the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid account on the device configured with a custom read-only role. The attack can be performed remotely.
