{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Ebak_SetGotoPak method in the file 3/Ebbak5.1/upload/class/functions.php allows uploading files to the /3/Ebak5.1/upload/setsave/ directory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted file upload is possible using the Ebak_SetGotoPak method, with the limitation that only files in the /3/Ebak5.1/upload/setsave/ directory can be uploaded. This is made worse by the ability to use SQL to write files with non-PHP suffixes, bypassing file extension restrictions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can write arbitrary files with non-PHP suffixes to the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities or if the server is configured to execute such files.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by calling the Ebak_SetGotoPak method and providing crafted input to upload a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the vulnerable function, and potentially use SQL to craft the file content."
