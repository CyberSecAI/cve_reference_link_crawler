- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WCP OpenWeather WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious requests and tricking a logged-in user into triggering them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into interacting with the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
