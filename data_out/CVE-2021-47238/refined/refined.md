  "CVE-2021-47238": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's IPv4 multicast implementation, specifically within the `ip_mc_add1_src` function. This vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the kernel manages source lists for multicast groups when network interfaces are brought down.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is an incorrect removal of `ip_mc_clear_src()` from `ip_mc_destroy_dev()`.  This function was removed in a previous commit under the assumption that `igmpv3_clear_delrec()` would handle resource freeing. However, `ip_mc_clear_src()` called from `igmpv3_clear_delrec()` does not release `in_dev->mc_list->sources`, resulting in a memory leak when a socket is closed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect resource management leading to memory leak.",
      "Flaw in logic for handling source list removal in the network stack.",
       "Removal of function call in one area without properly accounting for its role elsewhere"
    ],
    "Impact": "The primary impact is a memory leak.  If triggered repeatedly, this leak could potentially lead to system instability or denial-of-service due to memory exhaustion. The leak occurs in the kernel, which could cause a larger impact.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating socket options related to multicast source addresses, specifically using the `setsockopt` system call to add source-specific multicast membership. The vulnerability is triggered when a socket is closed and the associated network device is brought down.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to create and manipulate sockets and send multicast traffic or configure IP multicast settings. Local access is required as the vulnerability is triggered by setsockopt system call, and this call is restricted to the local user."
