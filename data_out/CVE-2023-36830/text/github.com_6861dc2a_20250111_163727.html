## Highlights

This release resolves compatibility issues with a set of `dbt-core` versions.

* `dbt-core` 1.5.2 onwards is now properly supported.
* support for `dbt-core` 1.1 to 1.4 has now been re-enabled after support had to be abandoned a few releases ago.

NOTE: We cannot guarantee that SQLFluff will always continue to remain compatible with all dbt versions, particularly as the folks at dbt-labs have often backported breaking changes to their internal APIs to previous versions of `dbt-core`. This release does at least bring more extensive internal testing to catch when this does occur to allow our community to react.

This release fixes also resolves a potential security issue for when using external libraries (and the `library_path` config setting), and also contains various dialect improvements.
