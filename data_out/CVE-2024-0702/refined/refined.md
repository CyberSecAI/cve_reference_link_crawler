Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from missing authorization checks within the `includes/class-pos-bridge-install.php` file of the Oliver POS plugin. Several AJAX actions are registered without verifying user capabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** The plugin lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions. Functions hooked to AJAX calls are accessible to users with subscriber-level access and above, while they should be restricted to administrators or users with specific capabilities.
- **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin uses `wp_ajax_` hooks without sufficient capability verification, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access via AJAX requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with minimal privileges (subscriber-level or above) can perform unauthorized actions, including:
- Deactivating the plugin.
- Disconnecting the subscription.
- Removing the subscription.
- Connecting the site with a new subscription.
- Syncing the status
- Modifying plugin settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the WordPress AJAX interface by sending requests to the registered AJAX actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to have at least subscriber-level privileges.
- The attacker does not need any specific or elevated privileges besides having a basic user account on the target WordPress site.
