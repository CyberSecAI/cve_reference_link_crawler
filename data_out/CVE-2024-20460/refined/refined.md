- **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of user input in the web-based management interface of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The web interface does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information on an affected device.
- **Attack Vectors:** An attacker persuades a user to click a crafted link containing malicious script.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and trick a user into clicking it. The attacker can be remote and does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
