# access\_token can be exposed in error message.

## Package

gomod

github.com/huandu/facebook/v2
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=2.7.1

## Patched versions

2.7.2

## Description

### Summary

access\_token can be exposed in error message on fail in HTTP request.

### Details

Using this module, when HTTP request fails, error message can contain access\_token. This can be happen when:

* module is sending HTTP request with query parameter `?access_token=...`.
* and HTTP request fails (errors like `facebook: cannot reach facebook server`).

In such situation, error message is constucted like following.

[facebook/session.go](https://github.com/huandu/facebook/blob/1591be276561bbdb019c0279f1d33cb18a650e1b/session.go#L558-L567)

Lines 558 to 567
in
[1591be2](/huandu/facebook/commit/1591be276561bbdb019c0279f1d33cb18a650e1b)

|  | if session.HttpClient == nil { |
| --- | --- |
|  | response, err = http.DefaultClient.Do(request) |
|  | } else { |
|  | response, err = session.HttpClient.Do(request) |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | if err != nil { |
|  | err = fmt.Errorf("facebook: cannot reach facebook server; %w", err) |
|  | return |
|  | } |

Original error message contained in it comes from `net/http` module. And it can contain full URL, that can contain query parameter `access_token`:

[https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.22.3:src/net/http/client.go;l=629-633](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/refs/tags/go1.22.3%3Asrc/net/http/client.go;l=629-633)

[https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.22.3:src/net/url/url.go;l=30](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/refs/tags/go1.22.3%3Asrc/net/url/url.go;l=30)

It should be very common that applications log error message when they encounter errors. As a result, access\_token can be stored into log server and some other infrastructures. Of course other careless error handling in client code that causing other security problems can exist.

I'm not very sure that whether we can consider that github.com/huandu/facebook is vulnerable. Anyway, I think current error message, that can expose access\_token, is not desirble.

### PoC

Request me this section if you need complete instruction.

### Impact

Client applications with following conditions can be affected.

* logs error message from this module
* or returns error message to client as something like HTTP response.
* or uses error messages somewhere

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
