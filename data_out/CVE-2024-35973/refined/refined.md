{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `pskb_inet_may_pull()` function in the Linux kernel's networking stack, used in the geneve tunnel implementation, only checks `skb->protocol` and does not properly handle cases where a VLAN tag is present. This can lead to the network header not pointing to the correct location and the skb linear part being smaller than expected, which can trigger an uninitialized value read in `geneve_xmit()`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete input validation in the `pskb_inet_may_pull()` function which does not properly handle VLAN tagged packets",
      "Improper calculation of the network header length when a vlan tag is present"
    ],
    "impact": "An uninitialized value read leading to a kernel crash, which is a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a geneve packet with a VLAN tag, crafted such that the network header is not pulled correctly"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets that can trigger the vulnerable code path, specifically involving geneve tunnels and VLAN tagging. This could involve local access, network access depending on the setup of the network."
