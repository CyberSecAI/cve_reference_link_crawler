In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: avoid using null object of framebuffer

Instead of using state->fb->obj[0] directly, get object from framebuffer
by calling drm_gem_fb_get_obj() and return error code when object is
null to avoid using null object of framebuffer.
