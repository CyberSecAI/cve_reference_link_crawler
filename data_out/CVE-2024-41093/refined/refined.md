Based on the provided information, all of the commits address the same vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from directly accessing the framebuffer object `state->fb->obj[0]` without proper validation in the `amdgpu_vkms_prepare_fb` and `amdgpu_vkms_cleanup_fb` functions within the AMDGPU kernel driver. Specifically, if the framebuffer object is NULL, dereferencing it leads to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code directly accesses `state->fb->obj[0]` without checking if `state->fb` or `obj[0]` are NULL. If either is NULL, it leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic/Denial of Service:** A NULL pointer dereference in the kernel can cause a system crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by attempting to utilize a framebuffer object that has not been properly initialized or has been freed/deallocated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the DRM subsystem and trigger the vulnerable code path, possibly by manipulating the framebuffer setup.

**Changes:**
The fix replaces direct access of `new_state->fb->obj[0]` with a call to `drm_gem_fb_get_obj(new_state->fb, 0)`. This function retrieves the object and returns NULL if it is invalid. The code then checks for the returned object and returns an error code if it is null, preventing the null pointer dereference.
The same pattern is applied to the cleanup function: it now calls `drm_gem_fb_get_obj` and checks if the returned object is valid before dereferencing it.
