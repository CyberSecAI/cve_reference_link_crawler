The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41085.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the incorrect sequence of operations during the auto-assembly of pmem regions in the CXL subsystem. The `cxl_nvd` (CXL NVDIMM) structure, which is needed during the pmem region probe, was being registered after the endpoint port probe. In cases where the endpoint probe causes a pmem region probe, the `cxl_nvd` would not yet be available, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `cxl_pmem_region_probe` function. This occurs because the required `cxl_nvd` structure is not initialized when the probe is invoked.
- **Incorrect Dependency:** The registration of the `cxl_nvd` was incorrectly sequenced, causing it to be unavailable when needed during auto-assembly of pmem regions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** The null pointer dereference leads to a kernel crash, specifically a "kernel NULL pointer dereference" and "not-present page" error. This results in a denial of service.
- **System Instability:** The crash can cause the system to become unstable and unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the CXL endpoint port probing when the system attempts to auto-assemble a pmem region.
- The attack vector is through the normal boot process or when a device is attached/probed that triggers the auto-assembly process of CXL pmem regions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would not directly cause the vulnerability, it is triggered by the system's own CXL subsystem during the device probing process.
- No specific attacker capabilities or positions are needed, the vulnerability is triggered during standard system operation involving CXL devices.
