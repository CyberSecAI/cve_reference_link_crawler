- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of input from an untrusted external source. Specifically, MongoDB Compass may accept and use insufficiently validated connection strings from untrusted sources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation leading to potential unintended application behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Data disclosure and enabling attackers to impersonate users are potential impacts.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation through manipulation of untrusted connection strings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to supply untrusted connection string data to MongoDB Compass, which requires a low privilege user. The attack complexity is high.
