Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The OAuth2 filter in Envoy was incorrectly calling `continueDecoding()` after `decoder_callbacks_->encodeHeaders()` when processing a request. This is problematic because `continueDecoding()` should not be called after a local response has been sent via `encodeHeaders()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect filter logic:** The filter's logic incorrectly assumed that a further call to the authentication server would be performed, which is not always the case (specifically when a valid access token is already present).
- **Premature `continueDecoding()`:** Calling `continueDecoding()` after `encodeHeaders()` which sends a local response, leads to a violation of the expected filter chain behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The incorrect call to `continueDecoding()` results in a crash in newer versions of Envoy due to an `ASSERT()` failure. In older versions, this can lead to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The vulnerability is triggered during the normal authentication flow of the OAuth2 filter. This means an attacker can exploit this remotely, by sending requests that trigger the OAuth authentication process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the Envoy proxy.
- **No special privileges:** No specific privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability. The attack is possible through normal interaction with the Envoy instance utilizing the OAuth filter.
- **No user interaction:** No user interaction is required, making it easily exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists within the `decodeHeaders()` function of the OAuth2 filter.
- The issue was identified by Raul Gutierrez Segales, and was originally reported by Weiqiu Wen.
- The fix involves not calling `continueDecoding()` after sending a local redirect response within the OAuth filter.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a high severity, with a CVSS score of 7.5.
- The vulnerability is related to `CWE-119` (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and `CWE-416` (Use After Free)

The provided commit diff shows the changes made to correct the issue, primarily by removing the extra `continueDecoding()` call.
