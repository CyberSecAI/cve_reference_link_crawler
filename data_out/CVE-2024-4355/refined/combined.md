This plugin was the only one that was able to keep my website live and VPS server up, because of thousand of bots requests per minute. It was a lifesaver! And the support helped me with a case faster than a paid support does.

I have a site configured in a way that makes similar plugins fail. This one works like a charm. When I did encounter a problem, I filed a ticket. I got an acknowledgement in less than 20 minutes and by the following morning, the plugin had been updated and the issue fully resolved. Bravo!

Install Bad Bots and be super annoyed because the plugin wants to install an addition. No matter where you look in wp/admin.
No, it’s not worth it. Let them bad bots amuse themselves on your site.
