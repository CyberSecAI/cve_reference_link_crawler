The Block Bad Bots and Stop Bad Bots Crawlers and Spiders and Anti Spam Protection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the stopbadbots_get_ajax_data() function in all versions up to, and including, 10.24. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to expose visitor data.
