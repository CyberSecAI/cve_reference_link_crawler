- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The two-factor authentication code is stored in a cookie without proper validation or integrity checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reliance on cookies without validation and integrity checking in a security decision, leading to a two-factor authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass two-factor authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating or replaying the cookie containing the two-factor code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid login cookie for the user.
