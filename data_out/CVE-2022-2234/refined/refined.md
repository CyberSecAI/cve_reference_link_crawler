- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, allowing for command injection. An authenticated user can modify parameters to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-77).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute commands directly in the underlying operating system of the affected mySCADA myPRO system. This could lead to a variety of consequences, such as system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, or manipulation of industrial processes.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely with low attack complexity. The attacker must have valid credentials (authenticated user) to access the vulnerable functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the affected system and needs to be an authenticated user.
