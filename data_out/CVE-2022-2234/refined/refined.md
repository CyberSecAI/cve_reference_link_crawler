Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** Command Injection (CWE-77)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the operating system. Specifically, an authenticated user can modify parameters to achieve this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied inputs that are later used in system commands. This allows for the injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary commands directly on the operating system of the affected mySCADA myPRO systems. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities including, but not limited to:
    *   System compromise
    *   Data breaches
    *   Denial of service
    *   Manipulation of industrial processes

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low.
*   **Privilege Required:** Requires a valid user account (authenticated user).
*   **User Interaction:** No user interaction is needed beyond initial authentication.
*   **Scope Change:** The exploitation of this vulnerability can affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
*   The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the system.

**Affected Products:**
*   mySCADA myPRO versions 8.26.0 and prior.

**Mitigations:**
*   Upgrade to mySCADA myPRO version 8.27.0 or higher.
*   Minimize network exposure of control system devices, ensuring they are not accessible from the Internet.
*   Locate control system networks behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
*   Use secure remote access methods like VPNs, and keep VPN software up to date.

**CVSS Score:** 9.9 (Critical)
**CVSS Vector String:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
