Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-2529:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles argument validation of a variable in specific situations related to HTML components. It is related to the way Internet Explorer processes arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect argument validation in Internet Explorer's handling of HTML components. This allows a specially crafted web page to cause issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution.
- An attacker can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
- This control enables the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted Web page.
- Attackers can host such pages on their own sites or inject malicious content into compromised sites, or sites hosting user provided content.
- They rely on convincing a user to visit these malicious websites (e.g. through links in emails/IM).
- Attackers could also use methods like banner advertisements to display the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or inject malicious content into a webpage.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to view the malicious webpage.
- No specific user level of the attacker is needed other than to be external.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability was publicly disclosed at the time of the bulletin's release.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Internet Explorer (5.01, 6, 7, and 8).
- The vulnerability also impacts Firefox users with the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) plug-in installed, if it is not disabled.

**Mitigating Factors:**

- Users with fewer rights are less impacted.
- Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 mitigates the vulnerability.
- Opening HTML e-mails in the Restricted sites zone also mitigates this.

**Workarounds:**
- Setting security zones to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting
- Adding trusted sites to the Trusted Sites zone.
- Disabling or prompting for XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer.
