- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leading to arbitrary file deletion. Specifically, the software doesn't properly validate HTTP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to delete arbitrary files from the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected software via the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated, remote attacker is required to exploit this vulnerability.
