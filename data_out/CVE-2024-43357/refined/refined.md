  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators, introduced by a May 2021 spec refactor may lead to mis-implementation. The internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult objects that it creates, assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately, these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able, triggering arbitrary behaviour, including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants.",

      "CWE-248",

    "impact": "Type confusion, pointer dereference, and uncaught exception.",
    "attack_vectors": "A carefully constructed code could trigger a state transition from a getter method for the promise's `then` property, which causes the engine to fail an assertion of this assumption, causing an uncaught exception.",
