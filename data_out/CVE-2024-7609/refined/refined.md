      "CWE-22"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a Path Traversal attack, potentially leading to unauthorized access to files and directories outside the intended restricted area. This has a high impact on confidentiality and low impact on integrity and availability on the vulnerable system. The subsequent system may also suffer high impact on confidentiality, while no impact on integrity and availability.",
