- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Citadela Listing Plugin versions prior to 5.20.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack can allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available to the user and the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to lure an authenticated user into interacting with a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
