- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper file signature verification checks in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Cortex XDR agent fails to properly verify the signatures of executable files. This allows for the execution of untrusted software by bypassing the agent's blocking capabilities. Specifically, CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature is the identified weakness.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the Cortex XDR agent's executable blocking capabilities and run untrusted executables on the device. This can lead to the execution of malicious software without detection or blocking by the agent.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack vector, requiring local access to the targeted device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs low privileges on the targeted device. No user interaction is required.
