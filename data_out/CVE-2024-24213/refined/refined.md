Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24213:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The github content explicitly mentions "CVE : [CVE-2024-24213]" and "Exploit Title: [Supabase PostgreSQL v15.1 was discovered to contain a SQL injection]". This strongly indicates the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in Supabase's implementation of PostgreSQL v15.1.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, meaning an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into user inputs or data streams that are then executed by the database.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact of a SQL injection can be severe, potentially allowing an attacker to:
       - Read sensitive data from the database.
       - Modify or delete data.
       - Execute arbitrary commands on the database server (depending on the database user's permissions).
   - **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through SQL injection, which usually involves crafting malicious SQL queries and sending it to the vulnerable application.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need a way to submit or influence the SQL queries executed by the vulnerable Supabase PostgreSQL instance. This would likely involve interacting with an application that uses the database.

**3. Additional Notes:**

-   The github content provides details such as "Google Dork: [Supabase]" which indicates the vulnerability may be exposed publicly.
-   The github content also includes the date [February 8th, 2024] which can be used to understand the timeline of the vulnerability
-   The github content specifies the targeted version "PostgreSQL 15.1 - on x86\_64-pc-linux-gnu"

**Summary:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2024-24213 is a SQL injection vulnerability in Supabase PostgreSQL v15.1. This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to data, modify/delete data, or execute arbitrary commands on the database server. The attack vector is through a SQL injection, and attackers need the ability to inject SQL code.
