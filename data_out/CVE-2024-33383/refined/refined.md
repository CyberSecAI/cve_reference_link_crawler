- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `FileController#fileDownload()` function in Novel-Plus does not properly sanitize the `filePath` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted GET request to the `/common/sysFile/download` endpoint with a malicious `filePath` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and have a valid session, which requires prior authentication to access the background.
