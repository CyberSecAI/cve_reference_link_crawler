- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin `Void Contact Form 7 Widget For Elementor Page Builder` does not properly sanitize user input, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts would then be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through the plugin's interface. The specific injection point isn't detailed, but it's likely via user-supplied data that is not sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code through an interface controlled by the vulnerable plugin, which is likely to be accessible to users with author privileges.
