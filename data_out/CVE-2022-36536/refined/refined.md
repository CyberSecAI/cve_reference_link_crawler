Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2022-36536: Insecure Session Token Creation**

*   **Root Cause:** The application generates session tokens based on the current date and time, encoded in base64.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The predictable nature of the token generation allows for easy brute-forcing.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker full administrative access to the web GUI.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote brute-force attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the login page of the application and guess/brute-force the generated token based on time.

**CVE-2022-36533: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:**  Missing output encoding of user-provided profile settings.
*  **Weaknesses:** The application does not sanitize the user provided input for ProfileName, OriginalProfileName, LeftPath, and RightPath parameters in post\_profilesettings.php, allowing a malicious user to store arbitrary JavaScript code in these settings.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the application when profiles are viewed.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker with access to the application can store the malicious payload and any user viewing this data will trigger the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires access to modify profile settings of the application.

**CVE-2022-36533: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing output encoding in error and status pages.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not sanitize user provided input in the profile parameter of status.php and default error pages.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript code execution through crafted malicious links.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious link with javascript code in the error or status pages that when visited by a user executes this code.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious link that they must induce a victim to open in a web browser.

**CVE-2022-36534: Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application allows execution of arbitrary commands or scripts before/after running a profile.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary commands into the 'Job\_ExecuteBefore' and 'Job\_ExecuteAfter' parameters in post\_profilesettings.php.
*   **Impact:**  An authenticated attacker can gain root access on the server by injecting and executing crafted commands due to the application running with root privileges by default.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker with access to the application can inject a malicious command/script that is then executed by the application.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires access to modify profile settings of the application.
