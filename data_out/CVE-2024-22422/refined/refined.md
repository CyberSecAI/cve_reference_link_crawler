{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `normalizePath` function can be tricked to return the current directory ('.'). The server then attempts to delete this directory using `fs.rmSync` without proper error handling, leading to a crash due to trying to remove a directory instead of a file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization: The `normalizePath` function does not adequately prevent directory traversal when input is '.'.",
      "Missing error handling: The `fs.rmSync` operation is not wrapped in a try-catch block, causing the process to crash when an error occurs (attempting to remove a directory)."
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated denial of service. An attacker can crash the server with a single HTTP request, causing the application to become unavailable.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via the `/api/system/data-exports/:filename` endpoint which is publicly accessible without authentication. The attacker sends a GET request with the filename parameter set to `.`.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction, only the ability to send HTTP requests to the server."
  },
  "patch": {
    "summary": "The vulnerability was addressed by removing the export functionality entirely, including the affected API endpoint, rather than fixing the code.",
    "changes": [
        "Removed the export/import settings page.",
        "Removed the related API endpoint in `server/endpoints/system.js`.",
        "Removed data export/import functions from the frontend `system.js` model.",
        "Removed the export/import paths from `frontend/src/utils/paths.js`.",
       "Removed the `data.js` file from `server/utils/files/`."
