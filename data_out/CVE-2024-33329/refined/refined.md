Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a **hard-coded privileged GUID** within the LumisXP application. This hardcoded identifier allows bypassing authentication and accessing internal resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hardcoded GUID that grants unauthorized access.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Although not explicitly stated, the described vulnerability aligns with IDOR, where an attacker can directly access resources by manipulating parameters, in this case, using the known hardcoded GUID within the `lumChannelId` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the normal authentication mechanisms.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** Successful exploitation allows access to internal pages and other sensitive information about the LumisXP application and potentially the domains it manages.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The response to the crafted request exposes "various component information and internal information."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request.
*   **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `lumChannelId` parameter in the URL by inserting the hardcoded GUID.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LumisXP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the LumisXP server.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability due to the hardcoded GUID.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the `lumChannelId` parameter name and the specific hardcoded GUID `00000000F00000000000000000000002`.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects LumisXP versions 15.0.x to 16.1.x.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`.
*   The issue was reported through responsible disclosure, confirmed by the vendor, and subsequently fixed.
