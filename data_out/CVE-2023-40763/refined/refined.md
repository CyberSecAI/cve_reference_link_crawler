*   The attacker needs to access the "Forgot Password" form, which is a publicly accessible feature.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content is part of a larger security research project that identified multiple vulnerabilities across various PHPJabbers products. The researchers attempted to notify PHPJabbers of these issues but received no response.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 2.0 of the Taxi Booking Script, but there's no mention if other versions are affected.
* The article also provides Proof of Concept (PoC) for other vulnerabilities but only states the existence of this vulnerability as a user enumeration in forgot password.
