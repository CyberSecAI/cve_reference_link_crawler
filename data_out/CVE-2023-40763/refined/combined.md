This online taxi booking system is a great asset for all taxi service providers that have a website but no booking functionality yet. Take a look at the key features that come standard with our taxi script and test it out for yourself:

 Easy Taxi Management

Create descriptive taxi profiles and help your clients select the most suitable car for their transfer. Set passenger and luggage limits. Define a start fee, the fee per person, and the price per mile.

 Google Maps Integration

To select the pick-up and drop-off locations, customers simply need to start typing the address and select the right suggestion. The route will be marked on the built-in Google Map.

 Various Extra Services

Add extra services through the back-end system of the online cab booking script and allow customers to select them while making the online reservation. You can set the price per service or price per person.

 Email & SMS Notifications

Send custom autoresponder messages via email and SMS to both admins and clients upon a new booking, payment, or cancellation. To enable the SMS functionality, you need to request an API key. [View SMS plans](web-sms)

 Simple Booking Process

Let our clients share their experience with our taxi script and how it has improved their online business!

“

Web Calendar by PHPJabbers is a great little script for a small price. For those who do not need or want the complexity of a calendaring program with tons of options that you never use, this is a great alternative. In addition, the support is quick and helpful. I would highly recommend others to give this Web Calendar script a try. It is well worth it.

Michael Monos

“

We purchased the Web Calendar from PHPjabbers.com several months ago, this web calendar is awesome and very easy to setup/use. We were easily able to create a form to allow users to add events to the calendar due to the nice database design. While the settings that come with the software are great, recently we had a need to change some other colors and Kosta was awesome working with us to make that happen.

Mike Sweany

You are a life-save. I am so pleased with your products and services. I will recommend your scripts at PHPJabbers.com to whom I know will benefit from it.

Thanks. You guys are amazing!

Today, I want to follow up the previous post ([https://medium.com/@mfortinsec/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-phpjabbers-part-2-4fa5e2ccfe2e](/%40mfortinsec/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-phpjabbers-part-2-4fa5e2ccfe2e)) about some additional vulnerabilities discovered through a recent collaborative security research project. This was done through a local group called the Atlantic CyberSecurity Collective.

Our team, consisting of a diverse and talented group of researchers, has conducted an extensive security review on the PHPJabbers collection of scripts, and during our research, we came across some significant security vulnerabilities. It’s worth mentioning that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could potentially pose serious threats to user data and the overall integrity of these products. We submitted our findings to MITRE, a globally recognized cybersecurity standards organization. Consequently, these vulnerabilities were validated and assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

* CVE-2023–40748
* CVE-2023–40749
* CVE-2023–40750
* CVE-2023–40751
* CVE-2023–40752
* CVE-2023–40753
* CVE-2023–40754
* CVE-2023–40755
* CVE-2023–40756
* CVE-2023–40757
* CVE-2023–40758
* CVE-2023–40759
* CVE-2023–40760
* CVE-2023–40761
* CVE-2023–40762
* CVE-2023–40763
* CVE-2023–40764
* CVE-2023–40765
* CVE-2023–40766
* CVE-2023–40767

Note that we are all professionals with full time jobs and other responsibilities. With the sheer amount of products in the PHP Jabbers lineup and limited time available, we weren’t able to assess every single product. There is a lot of code reuse in those applications, so it would be safe to assume most vulnerabilities are present in other products.

Members of the research group conducted some additional research in PHP Jabbers products and found vulnerabilities which aren’t addressed in this disclosure.

We informed the PHP Jabbers team through their online forms, but were completely ignored. Each of our attempts at communicating these vulnerabilities was met with silence and an almost instantaneous “closed” status to our submitted tickets.

Our intentions behind sharing this information aren’t to tarnish the vendor’s reputation or stir up panic among its user base. Instead, we aim to encourage proactive and transparent collaboration within the cybersecurity community. It’s crucial to remember that we all share the same goal — enhancing the overall security of products and fostering a safer digital world for users.

In the sections to follow, we will delve into each of the identified vulnerabilities:

# #1: Food Delivery Script 3.0 SQL injection (SQLi) in q parameter

(CVE-2023–40748)

Edit the q parameter of index.php. Example: pjAdminOrders%26action%3dpjActionGetNewOrder%26column%3dcreated%26direction%3dASC%26page%3d1%26rowCount%3d50%26q%3d-1910')+OR+6100%3d6100%23%26type%3d

![]()

PoC for q SQLi in Burp Repeater

# #2: Food Delivery Script 3.0 SQL injection (SQLi) in column parameter

(CVE-2023–40749)
