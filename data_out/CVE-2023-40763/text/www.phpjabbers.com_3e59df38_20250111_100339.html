## Product Highlights

This online taxi booking system is a great asset for all taxi service providers that have a website but no booking functionality yet. Take a look at the key features that come standard with our taxi script and test it out for yourself:

 Easy Taxi Management

Create descriptive taxi profiles and help your clients select the most suitable car for their transfer. Set passenger and luggage limits. Define a start fee, the fee per person, and the price per mile.

 Google Maps Integration

To select the pick-up and drop-off locations, customers simply need to start typing the address and select the right suggestion. The route will be marked on the built-in Google Map.

 Various Extra Services

Add extra services through the back-end system of the online cab booking script and allow customers to select them while making the online reservation. You can set the price per service or price per person.

 Email & SMS Notifications

Send custom autoresponder messages via email and SMS to both admins and clients upon a new booking, payment, or cancellation. To enable the SMS functionality, you need to request an API key. [View SMS plans](web-sms)

 Simple Booking Process

Customers can book their preferred taxi service and pay online in less than 5 minutes and 24/7, both from home and on the go – they just need to follow the easy step-by-step booking procedure.

 10 Responsive Front-End Color Themes

The front-end UI of our cab booking script is mobile-optimized and adapts to all portable devices. Its layout is available in 10 different color schemes – pick the one that best matches your website design.

 Online & Offline Payments

Clients can pay online using PayPal and Authorize.net or select a traditional payment method: cash, bank transfer, or credit card. Adjust your payment settings from the Admin Panel's back-end system.

 PHP Source Code Customization

## Testimonials

Let our clients share their experience with our taxi script and how it has improved their online business!

“

Web Calendar by PHPJabbers is a great little script for a small price. For those who do not need or want the complexity of a calendaring program with tons of options that you never use, this is a great alternative. In addition, the support is quick and helpful. I would highly recommend others to give this Web Calendar script a try. It is well worth it.

Michael Monos

“

We purchased the Web Calendar from PHPjabbers.com several months ago, this web calendar is awesome and very easy to setup/use. We were easily able to create a form to allow users to add events to the calendar due to the nice database design. While the settings that come with the software are great, recently we had a need to change some other colors and Kosta was awesome working with us to make that happen.

Mike Sweany

You are a life-save. I am so pleased with your products and services. I will recommend your scripts at PHPJabbers.com to whom I know will benefit from it.

Thanks. You guys are amazing!
