### Description

The QS Dark Mode Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.

### [Broken and unable to uninstall](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/broken-and-unable-to-uninstall/)

[Emily](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wilkinsone/ "Posts by Emily")
November 15, 2022

I have just tested this plugin. It has good features but the switch doesn’t seem to display properly and for each page to be shown in dark mode you have to switch to light mode and then back to dark mode each time. In my view this is broken and I will not be using it. The most frustrating thing though is that it is impossible to uninstall this plugin from the backend of the site – it needs to be done through cPanel.

Aug 2022:
I immediately invested in this very actively developed super affordable lifetime license for the personal pro version – which includes a very generous capacity for up to 20 sites.  Feature-wise, it absolutely matches and in some case exceeds comparable subscription-only premium plugins.
Quomodosoft provides outstanding support – and goes the extra mile to ensure you are totally delighted with your purchase and assistance.
The wordpress community is extremely fortunate to have this level of professionalism, support, and active development with Quomodosoft plugins.
