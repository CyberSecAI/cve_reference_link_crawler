### [Broken and unable to uninstall](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/broken-and-unable-to-uninstall/)

[Emily](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wilkinsone/ "Posts by Emily")

I have just tested this plugin. It has good features but the switch doesn‚Äôt seem to display properly and for each page to be shown in dark mode you have to switch to light mode and then back to dark mode each time. In my view this is broken and I will not be using it. The most frustrating thing though is that it is impossible to uninstall this plugin from the backend of the site ‚Äì it needs to be done through cPanel.

Aug 2022:
I immediately invested in this very actively developed super affordable lifetime license for the personal pro version ‚Äì which includes a very generous capacity for up to 20 sites. ¬†Feature-wise, it absolutely matches and in some case exceeds comparable subscription-only premium plugins.
Quomodosoft provides outstanding support ‚Äì and goes the extra mile to ensure you are totally delighted with your purchase and assistance.
The wordpress community is extremely fortunate to have this level of professionalism, support, and active development with Quomodosoft plugins.
