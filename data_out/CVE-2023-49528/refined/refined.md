      "cve": "CVE-2023-49528",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "Heap buffer overflow in FFmpeg's dialoguenhance filter.",
      "details": "The vulnerability is located in the `de_stereo` function within `libavfilter/af_dialoguenhance.c` at line 261, resulting in a heap-buffer-overflow. The issue occurs when using the `dialoguenhance` filter, specifically within the `de_stereo` function, where a memory copy operation (`memcpy`) attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by processing a specially crafted audio file with the `dialoguenhance` filter.",
       "affected_component": "FFmpeg's libavfilter/af_dialoguenhance.c (de_stereo function), chromium's bundled FFmpeg library",
      "root_cause": "Heap buffer overflow due to incorrect buffer size calculation or handling in the `de_stereo` function during the memcpy operation.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Heap buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a crash, potentially leading to denial of service. It's also possible that this vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker has the ability to control the overflowed data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Processing a specially crafted audio file with the `dialoguenhance` filter."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the FFmpeg processing, either directly or by having the target application process a malicious audio file with the `dialoguenhance` filter enabled."
