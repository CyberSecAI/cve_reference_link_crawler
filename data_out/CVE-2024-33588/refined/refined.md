- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation via a function that lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber (or have an equivalent low-privilege role) on the WordPress site.
