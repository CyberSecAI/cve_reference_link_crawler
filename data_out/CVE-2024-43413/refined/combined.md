published
GHSA-pfxp-vxh7-2h9f
Sep 3, 2024

## Package

composer

Xibo CMS
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<4.1.0

## Patched versions

>=4.1.0

## Description

### Summary

An XSS vulnerability allows authorized users to execute JavaScript via the DataSet functionality.

### Impact

Users can design a DataSet with a HTML column which contains JavaScript, which is intended functionality. The JavaScript gets executed on the Data Entry page and in any Layouts which reference it.

### Patches

This behaviour has been changed in 4.1.0 to show HTML/CSS/JS as code on the Data Entry page.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds for this issue.

### References

Reporter ref: K-Xibo-2024-001 Xibo CMS Cross Site Scripting

### Acknowledgements

The vulnerability was discovered by Sergey Bobrov (Kaspersky, <https://kaspersky.com/>)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-43413
