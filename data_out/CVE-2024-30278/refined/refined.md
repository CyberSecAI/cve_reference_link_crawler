- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) which leads to memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability leads to memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access and convince the user to perform a certain action to trigger the vulnerability (the exact user interaction is not specified). No privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N).
