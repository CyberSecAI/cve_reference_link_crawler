- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Languages - Backend" section of the Quick CMS v6.7 backend allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could lead to account compromise, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor injects a crafted JavaScript payload into the Dashboard field within the "Languages - Backend" settings. When a user accesses the web page, this payload gets executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the Quick CMS admin panel to inject the malicious JavaScript code.
