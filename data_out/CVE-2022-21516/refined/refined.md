```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability exists in the Enterprise Manager Install component. The specific flaw is not detailed, but the component is related to installation and is accessible via HTTP.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the Enterprise Manager installation process, potentially leading to a compromise of the system.
- Impact of exploitation: Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify the system during the installation process. This could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, although the risk assessment indicates low impact on all three.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is over the network using the HTTP protocol, meaning it is remotely exploitable, although a low confidentiality, integrity and availability impact is noted.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs network access to the affected Enterprise Manager system. They do not require authentication, which means this is an unauthenticated remote exploit.
