- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote but needs to persuade a user to visit a specific webpage containing the malicious payload.
