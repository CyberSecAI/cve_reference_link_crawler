These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-stored-xss-vqz7gC8W>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect all software releases for the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:    + RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Routers   + RV042 Dual WAN VPN Routers   + RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   + RV082 Dual WAN VPN Routers   + RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   + RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:    + RV160 VPN Routers   + RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV260 VPN Routers   + RV260P VPN Routers with PoE   + RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Routers  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  To mitigate these vulnerabilities on Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers, disable remote management. To mitigate these vulnerabilities on Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 Routers, disable remote management and block access to ports 443 and 60443. The routers will still be accessible through the LAN interface after the mitigation has been implemented. Disable Remote Management To disable remote management, do the following:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > General**.   3. Uncheck the **Remote Management** check box.Block Access to Ports 443 and 60443 First, add a new service to the access rules of the device for port 60443. It is not necessary to create a service for port 443 because that service is predefined in the services list.    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > Access Rules**.   3. Click **Service Management**.   4. In the **Service Name** field, enter **TCP-60443**.   5. From the **Protocol** drop-down list, choose **TCP**.   6. In both of the **Port Range** fields, enter **60443**.   7. Click **Add to List**.   8. Click **OK**. Next, create access rules to block ports 443 and 60443. To create an access rule to block port 443, do the following:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > Access Rules**.   3. Click **Add**.   4. From the **Action** drop-down list, choose **Deny**.   5. From the **Service** drop-down list, choose **HTTPS (TCP 443-443)**.   6. From the **Log** drop-down list, choose **Log packets match this rule**.   7. From the **Source Interface** drop-down list, choose the option that matches the WAN connection on the device.   8. From the **Source IP** drop-down list, choose **Any**.   9. From the **Destination IP** drop-down list, choose **Single**.   10. In both of the **Destination IP** fields, enter the WAN IP address.   11. Click **Save**. To create an access rule to block port 60443, repeat the preceding steps, but for Step 5, choose **HTTPS (TCP 60443-60443)** from the **Service** drop-down list.  **Note**: If a second WAN port is being used, two additional ACL rules need to be set up using the WAN number and IP address for the second WAN port.  While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. The Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 Routers have entered the end-of-life process. Customers are advised to refer to the end-of-life notices for these products:  [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-736069.html)[End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV042 and RV042G VPN Router (all models)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-743070.html)[End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-736749.html)[End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-743069.html)  When considering a device migration, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the new products will be sufficient for their network needs, that the new devices contain sufficient memory, and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new product. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
