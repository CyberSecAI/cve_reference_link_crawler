### Summary:

Potential security vulnerabilities in some Intel® Chipset Firmware in Intel® Server Platform Services (SPS), Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) and the Intel Power Management Controller (PMC) may allow escalation of privilege or denial of service. Intel is releasing firmware updates to mitigate these potential vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2021-0060](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0060)

Description: Insufficient compartmentalization in HECI subsystem for the Intel(R) SPS before versions SPS\_E5\_04.01.04.516.0, SPS\_E5\_04.04.04.033.0, SPS\_E5\_04.04.03.281.0, SPS\_E5\_03.01.03.116.0, SPS\_E3\_05.01.04.309.0, SPS\_02.04.00.101.0, SPS\_SoC-A\_05.00.03.114.0, SPS\_SoC-X\_04.00.04.326.0, SPS\_SoC-X\_03.00.03.117.0, IGN\_E5\_91.00.00.167.0, SPS\_PHI\_03.01.03.078.0 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via physical access.

CVSS Base Score: 7.3 High

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H)

CVEID: [CVE-2021-33068](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-33068)

Description: Null pointer dereference in subsystem for Intel(R) AMT before versions 15.0.35 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via network access.

CVSS Base Score: 5.0 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L)

CVEID: [CVE-2021-0147](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0147)

Description: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc\_fw\_lbg\_c1-21ww02a and pmc\_fw\_lbg\_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.

CVSS Base Score: 4.4 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
