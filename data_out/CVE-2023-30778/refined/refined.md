- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PowerPress Podcasting Plugin for WordPress, versions <= 10.0.1, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will execute when users visit the site, potentially leading to user compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a vulnerable point in the plugin where user input is not properly sanitized, which is common for XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script through a vulnerable input field. The required privilege is "Contributor", which indicates that the attacker needs an account with this permission level.
