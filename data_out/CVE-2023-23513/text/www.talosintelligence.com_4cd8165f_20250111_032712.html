# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1660

## Apple DCERPC packet stats buffer overflow vulnerability

##### July 13, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-23513

##### SUMMARY

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the stats logging functionality of DCERPC library as used in Apple macOS 12.6.1 A specially-crafted network packet can lead to out-of-bounds memory modification which can lead to further memory corruption. An authenticated remote attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability. A local attacker can write to a local socket to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Apple macOS 12.6.1

##### PRODUCT URLS

macOS - <https://apple.com>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.1 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-129 - Improper Validation of Array Index

##### DETAILS

macOS is a series of proprietary operating systems developed by Apple. DCERPC framework is library, used as a component of macOS. DCERPC is a remote procedure call protocol that is the basis for RPC functionality on Windows. DCERPC framework on macOS implements this protocol and enables interoperability of Windows network services on macOS. For example, it is used on top of SMB, through which support for Active Directory is implemented. DCERPC framework is employed by the `rpcsvchost` binary that opens a number of UNIX sockets and expose different RPC functionality.

There exists a vulnerability in the way DCERPC framework processes incoming packets. Namely, while receiving and processing packets in function `receive_dispatch`, global statistics about received packets are kept. Information from the packet is directly used to index into a table of stats in the following code:

```
    pktp = (rpc_cn_packet_p_t) fragbuf_p->data_p;                                    [1]

    /*
     * Trace the incoming packet.
     */
    RPC_CN_PKT_TRC (pktp);
    RPC_CN_PKT_DUMP (pktp, fragbuf_p->data_size);

    /*
     * Keep some stats on the packets received.
     */
    RPC_CN_STATS_INCR (pstats[RPC_CN_PKT_PTYPE (pktp)].rcvd);                       [2]
    RPC_CN_STATS_INCR (pkts_rcvd);

```

In the above code, at [1], a pointer to packet data is retrieved, and packet type is then used to increment count of received packets at [2]. Packet type is determined by macro `RPC_CN_PKT_PTYPE`, which simply casts the data pointer into header structure:

```
#define RPC_CN_PKT_PTYPE(pkt_p)           (RPC_CN_HDR_BIND(pkt_p).hdr.common_hdr.ptype)

```

Note that no check on validity of the packet type is performed. Structure `common_hdr` is:

```
typedef struct
{
    unsigned8  rpc_vers;               /* 00:01 RPC version - major */
    unsigned8  rpc_vers_minor;         /* 01:01 RPC version - minor */
    unsigned8  ptype;                  /* 02:01 packet type */
    unsigned8  flags;                  /* 03:01 flags */
    unsigned8  drep[4];                /* 04:04 ndr format */
    unsigned16 frag_len;               /* 08:02 fragment length */
    unsigned16 auth_len;               /* 10:02 authentication length */
    unsigned32 call_id;                /* 12:04 call identifier */
} rpc_cn_common_hdr_t, *rpc_cn_common_hdr_p_t;

```

From above, we can see that `ptype` is an unsigned 1-byte integer, meaning its values can range from 0 to 255. Packet type is used to index into `pstats` array, which is defined as `pstats[RPC_C_CN_PKT_MAX_TYPE + 1];` with `RPC_C_CN_PKT_MAX_TYPE` being 19. Since no sanity checks are performed on the packet type, we can conclude that large value of `ptype` in the incoming packet will cause an out-of-bounds memory to be accessed, signifying memory corruption.

The effect is that `RPC_CN_STATS_INCR` will be executed on memory outside of the bounds of `pstats` array, which is a global variable. In other words, it will cause a 1-byte increment at an out-of-bounds location. Out-of-bounds memory access can happen in increments dependent on the size of array entry, which in this case is 8 bytes, for a total of 2048 bytes. Depending on the memory layout, this could result in modification of sensitive data and further memory corruption, which could be used as a component of an exploit to achieve arbitrary code execution.

Examining the memory contents immediately after the buffer overflow shows that global variable `uuid_g_nil_uuid` follows the limited size array. Variable `uuid_g_nil_uuid` represents a NIL UUID and is supposed to contain only zeros. Modifying it directly has impact on operation of the program and could lead to other issues.

On macOS, vulnerable code could be reached over network, after authentication, through SMB protocol. However, it can also be triggered through access to local UNIX sockets in `/var/rpc/ncalrpc/*` via a regular user.

### Crash Information

With AddressSanitizer, the crash occurs on a read right before an increment.
