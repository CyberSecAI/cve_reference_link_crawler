- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing or insufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into performing an unwanted action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
