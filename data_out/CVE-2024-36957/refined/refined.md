The provided content contains several git commit logs and a Debian security advisory. The commit logs describe a fix for an off-by-one read vulnerability in the Linux kernel driver `octeontx2-af`, while the security advisory lists several CVEs fixed in a Debian LTS update, including CVE-2024-36957.

Based on the provided information, the vulnerability details for CVE-2024-36957 are as follows:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one read from userspace in the `rvu_dbg_qsize_write` function within the `octeontx2-af` driver. The code was attempting to copy `count + 1` bytes from userspace using `memdup_user(buffer, count + 1)`, while only `count` bytes were guaranteed to be valid.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The `memdup_user` function attempted to read one byte beyond the provided user buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to an information leak or other undefined behavior due to reading out of bounds.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker who can write to debugfs entries controlled by `rvu_dbg_qsize_write` could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write to the affected debugfs entry. This implies that the attacker must have the necessary privileges to access the debugfs entries related to this driver, which may require root or specific capabilities.

The fix involved replacing `memdup_user(buffer, count + 1)` with `memdup_user_nul(buffer, count)`. This ensures that only the provided user data is read and also ensures null termination of the string.
