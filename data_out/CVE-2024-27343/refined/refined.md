- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of PDF files, which can cause a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. The vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**:  A malicious PDF file. The target must open the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PDF file and have the user open the file.
