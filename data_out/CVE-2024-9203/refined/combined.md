### **Version 6.9.2 (1562)**

Release Date Nov 16, 2023

**Great news for your security! The passwordless future is here with Enpass passkey management!**

Passkeys are a faster, super-secure way sign in to websites using Windows Hello face or fingerprint recognition instead of passwords. ([Learn more about passkeys](/passkeys).)

**HOW PASSKEYS WORK**

* When you create an account using a passkey for authentication, Enpass creates a pair of “keys” that only work when used together.
* One key lives on the account, and the other lives encrypted in Enpass.
* When logging in, use your face or fingerprint authentication to allow the two keys to match together, confirming you’re really you.

**WHY PASSKEYS OVER PASSWORDS?**

* Because passkeys have two parts, kept in different places, they can’t be guessed, stolen, hacked, or captured by scammers — which makes passkeys exponentially more secure than passwords.

**WHY USE ENPASS TO MANAGE YOUR PASSKEYS?**

* Passkeys were originally device-specific, but with Enpass, you can sync your passkeys across your devices, making your accounts more secure no matter which device you’re using to login.

**ENPASS 6.9.2 ALSO FIXED A FEW BUGS**

* Fixed an connection issue with Nextcloud when the server URL contained a port number.
* Fixed a problem with the browser extension’s inline menu misbehaving for Items with a custom icon in Enpass.
* Fixed autofill suggestion bug specific to [dashboard.uberspace.de](http://dashboard.uberspace.de/)

### **Version 6.9.1 (1512)**

Release Date Sep 26, 2023

Hello Enpass fans! We’ve crushed a few bugs. Thanks for the bug reports!

Furthermore, this version includes updates that pave the way for introducing passkey management support on Windows. We’ve recently rolled out this support on other mobile platforms as well.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed occasional crashes when syncing with Google Drive.
* Fixed some unruly behavior of Tags when syncing vaults across devices.
* Fixed overlapping-text issue for Greek and Russian languages.
* Fixed “Unreachable Destination Folder for Sync’”error when selecting root drive for Folder Sync in Windows.

### **Version 6.9.0 (1466)**

Hello, everyone! We’re thrilled to bring you a new update packed with impressive features to enhance your security & experience on Enpass, for both our Personal and Business plan users. This release sets a higher bar for us as we’ve revisited and refined these features repeatedly, ensuring we surpass our own expectations.

Your security is our priority! In this update, we’ve strengthened the encryption of your Enpass data by increasing the number of iterations used on your master password for deriving the encryption key.

This release also marks a landmark moment in the Enpass journey as we’ve introduced much-requested features for our Enpass Business enterprise clients. This includes help for those who’ve forgotten their master passwords and the ability for admins to have a security dashboard with overall health score, information on vaults and lot more. Keep reading…

Release Date May 3, 2022

Hello everyone. We’re excited to share a big update with you. This release isn’t just about bug fixes and minor improvements. We’re celebrating the start of a whole new era for Enpass – Enpass for Business!

Businesses and large enterprises can now use Enpass to secure the passwords and sensitive data of their teams, and yes – we are still OFFLINE. We know not everyone is comfortable storing their passwords on someone else’s servers, and that applies to businesses too. Your wait for an offline password manager for your workplace over now that Enpass for Business is here.

**What’s New:**

* **Enpass for businesses:** If you’re in a business not using any password manager for team members and waited for any offline one, your wait is over! Enpass Business is here – keep your business sensitive data on your devices/cloud, set password policies, onboard users via SCIM supported Active Directory and there’s lot more if you’re using Microsoft 365 Business. Checkout our website for more!
* **Automatic Compromised Password Checker:** Password auditing has become more effective with added security. Compromised password checking is now automatic in Enpass and triggers whenever a new password is added or changed. Just enable it on from Audit > Compromised > Turn on.

**Improvements:**

* While creating or editing an item, you’ll now get suggestions to auto-complete the fields for Usernames, Emails, and Phone numbers with the most used values in the selected vault.
* You can now reveal an item’s password by pressing the Alt keys on the keyboard.

* On the Edit page, you will now have an option for password fields to use a password from the generator’s history. This is helpful when password for any website is changed successfully changing passwords using the browser extension is a success but the extension itself fails to capture the updated password for any reason. You can now manually edit the item and access the last generated password using this option.
* The ‘Show More’ button is back on the Enpass Assistant, hoping all your concerns with the ‘Match URL hostname’ functionality are gone for good.
* Added option to import Enpass vault from encrypted backup file in any existing vault. Just Select Import > Enpass > Backup file > Select the backup file from your machine> Select the Vault> Enter the password of the backup vault.

* Rectified an issue where the passwords having escape characters (‘<‘ and ‘=’)  were truncated while printing.
* Fixed an issue where the spaces after commas were not displayed in Enpass user interface.
* Fixed an issue where the item list was refreshing twice on unlocking the Enpass Assistant.

### **Version 6.7.4**

Release Date Nov 17, 2021

Good day, everyone! Today’s update is all about taking your autofill experience to next level when used with the latest extensions for your browsers. Previously, you had to move your cursor all the way to the Enpass icon in the browser toolbar to initiate autofill. Now, in the new extensions we’ve replaced this tedious process with a lightweight autofill popup menu that will appear on the web page itself with a list of suggestions to choose from.

This blazingly fast autofill experience is there for all the supported browsers, and you need to update the extensions as well.

Happy autofilling!!

**What’s New:**

* Support for Inline Autofill on browsers: Experience the new autofill using the inline popup menu, which is enabled by default and presents the logins, credit cards, and identities right there on the loaded forms on the webpage. This update has been made for all supported browsers.
* Keyboard shortcuts: Additional options to set keyboard shortcuts in your browser extensions to lock, autofill, and activate Enpass. The existing shortcuts (if any) will be reset.
* Code-signing certificate for executables has been updated as the current one is expiring this month. So if you get a warning message from antivirus or a Windows smart screen warning, it is due to the new code-signing certificate. Please allow the executable to run, and you should be good to go!

**Fixes:**

* Some of you were getting a message —This version of Enpass is out of date— on launching the Enpass app. This has been fixed.
* While importing data from 1Password, some items were missing due to the large size of the note items. This has been fixed.
* Enpass was updating the password of another item with the same username. This has been fixed.

### **Version 6.7.2**

Release Date Sep 10, 2021

Hello everyone! We would like to extend our sincere gratitude and appreciation for using Wi-Fi sync and for sharing your feedback.

This update contains a few, but important fixes for issues you’ve reported to us.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where Enpass Assistant was not autofilling on the first attempt after unlock.
* The former Enpass version was able to import 1Password data only from the 1PIF folder. We have added a new option as “.1PIF file” alongside “.1PIF folder”. Fixed the issue where some users were not able to select the .1PIF file while importing 1Password data.
* Fixed an issue where the trashed items were also included in the Identical items list under Audit.
* Hint for the Search field in Enpass Assistant was being overlapped in the Chinese Language. Fixed.

### **Version 6.7.0 (866)**

Release Date Aug 19, 2021

**What’s New:**

* The most awaited Enpass feature, Wi-Fi sync is at last, here. We have taken the word OFFLINE to a whole another level as now you get the option to sync your data across devices, CLOUDLESSLY — over your Wi-Fi or local network. This means you now have complete ownership of your data, and in turn, total peace of mind.

**Improvements:**

* All the tiles on the Audit dashboard with zero count will now be actionable, and count ‘0’ will be displayed in green color as good health.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where Enpass was not asking to save the changes in the item being edited if user clicked on any other item in the list.
* On launching the URL from Assistant’s detail page, Enpass was opening it in the default browser instead of in the context of that particular browser.
* After the recent Chrome browser update, the “Unknown Browser” message appeared on launching the browser extension. Fixed.
* Some WebDAV servers were dropping the connection with Enpass because of “Mozilla” being used as User-Agent in the network requests, fixed this issue by changing the User-Agent to “Mozilla 5.0 Enpass”.
* Enpass was hanging on changing the backup location. Fixed.
* Deleted Webform fields were left as zombies until the item itself was not deleted. Fixed.
* Fixed an issue where the detail page was becoming empty on shrinking the Enpass Window to collapse Sidebar.

### **Version 6.6.3 (836)**

Release Date July 13, 2021

**What’s New:**

We have changed the way how Enpass used to add shared items. Earlier, Enpass read the clipboard for shared items on every launch automatically. Now Enpass won’t automatically read the clipboard; you can add any shared item by selecting ‘Add an item from clipboard’ on the add item screen, or you can enable the ‘Check clipboard for shared items’ setting under Advance settings to explicitly allow Enpass to read the clipboard as before.

Added an option on the welcome screen to Activate Enpass, allowing you to activate your license immediately after installation.

# Submit #411207: Enpass Password Manager Windows 10 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | Enpass Password Manager Windows 10 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Hello VulnDB team, I have identified an issue with the Enpass password manager v6.9.3. This issue was reported to the Enpass team on January 11, 2024. They informed me that they will fix this issue. I tested their application with the latest version v6.11.3 (as of September 12, 2024), and the issue is now fixed. Although I asked them to include this issue in their release notes, they told me that they did it. However, this issue is not mentioned in their release notes. So, I am requesting your assistance in publishing a CVE ID for this issue. A similar CVE ID was published earlier this year by Kaspersky (CVE-2023-23349). The relevant email communication is available if anyone is interested. Here is a summary of the issue: An attacker with remote access to the user's host would be able to extract an entry from Enpass before v6.11.3 when the app is open and unlocked. Enpass automatically selects a user's entry and stores it in plaintext format within the process. Also, if the user selects additional entries, these entries will be available in plaintext format within the process. As a result, an attacker could extract this sensitive information and gain unauthorized access with this set of valid credentials. Here is the relevant code that could extract this entry from the process, if a memory dump is provided (https://github.com/efchatz/pandora/blob/main/headers/enpass/getCredsenpassEntries.h). A video demonstrating this attack is available in the Enpass section of the tool's README file (https://github.com/efchatz/pandora/blob/main/README.md#enpass). Please, let me know if you should require further information to release a CVE ID. Thank you. |
