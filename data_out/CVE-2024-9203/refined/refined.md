Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Enpass password manager, prior to version 6.11.3, stored selected user entries in plaintext within the application's process memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive data (user credentials) in plaintext within memory. This violates the principle of least privilege and exposes the data to unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who can access the memory of a user's machine could extract plaintext credentials, gaining unauthorized access to the user's accounts.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker can potentially gain access to multiple accounts if the user has selected multiple entries.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the user's host to perform memory extraction.
- **Memory Dump:** The attacker needs to acquire a memory dump of the Enpass process, either through malware or other techniques.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access** to the victim's system.
- Ability to **dump process memory**.
- The Enpass application must be **open and unlocked**.
- The attacker must have the ability to **analyze the memory dump** to locate and extract the plaintext credentials.

**Additional notes:**
- The submitter notes that they reported the issue to the Enpass team on January 11, 2024, and it was fixed in version 6.11.3 (released September 12, 2024).
- The issue was not explicitly mentioned in the Enpass release notes, which led to the submission for a CVE ID.
- A similar vulnerability (CVE-2023-23349) was previously published by Kaspersky.
- The submitter provides a link to their code on GitHub for extracting the credentials from the memory dump, as well as a video demonstration.
