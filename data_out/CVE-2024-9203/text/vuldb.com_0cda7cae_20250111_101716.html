# Submit #411207: Enpass Password Manager Windows 10 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | Enpass Password Manager Windows 10 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Hello VulnDB team, I have identified an issue with the Enpass password manager v6.9.3. This issue was reported to the Enpass team on January 11, 2024. They informed me that they will fix this issue. I tested their application with the latest version v6.11.3 (as of September 12, 2024), and the issue is now fixed. Although I asked them to include this issue in their release notes, they told me that they did it. However, this issue is not mentioned in their release notes. So, I am requesting your assistance in publishing a CVE ID for this issue. A similar CVE ID was published earlier this year by Kaspersky (CVE-2023-23349). The relevant email communication is available if anyone is interested. Here is a summary of the issue: An attacker with remote access to the user's host would be able to extract an entry from Enpass before v6.11.3 when the app is open and unlocked. Enpass automatically selects a user's entry and stores it in plaintext format within the process. Also, if the user selects additional entries, these entries will be available in plaintext format within the process. As a result, an attacker could extract this sensitive information and gain unauthorized access with this set of valid credentials. Here is the relevant code that could extract this entry from the process, if a memory dump is provided (https://github.com/efchatz/pandora/blob/main/headers/enpass/getCredsenpassEntries.h). A video demonstrating this attack is available in the Enpass section of the tool's README file (https://github.com/efchatz/pandora/blob/main/README.md#enpass). Please, let me know if you should require further information to release a CVE ID. Thank you. |
