### Summary:

Potential security vulnerabilities in the Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel® Standard Manageability may allow escalation of privilege or information disclosure. Intel is releasing prescriptive guidance to mitigate these potential vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2022-30601](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30601)

Description: Insufficiently protected credentials for Intel(R) AMT and Intel(R) Standard Manageability may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure and escalation of privilege via network access.

CVSS Base Score: 8.8 High

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L)

CVEID: [CVE-2022-30944](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30944)

Description: Insufficiently protected credentials for Intel(R) AMT and Intel(R) Standard Manageability may allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

CVSS Base Score: 7.4 High

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)

CVEID: [CVE-2022-28697](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28697)

Description: Improper access control in firmware for Intel(R) AMT and Intel(R) Standard Manageability may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via physical access.

CVSS Base Score: 7.0 High

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)

### Affected Products:

All versions of Intel® AMT and Intel® Standard Manageability.

Note: Firmware versions of Intel® AMT 3.x through 10.x are no longer supported versions. There is no new general release planned for these versions.

Intel will only provide prescriptive guidance for supported versions; no code changes are planned.

### Recommendations:

Intel recommends that users follow the steps below to address these issues:

For Intel® AMT and Intel® Standard Manageability, Intel recommends users follow existing security best practices and alternate security controls, including:

* CVE-2022-30944, CVE-2022-30601: Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) for Intel® AMT and Intel® Standard Manageability.
* CVE-2022-28697: Enable BIOS password protection on the Intel® Management Engine BIOS Extension (Intel® MEBX).  Intel recommends end-users to reset and then set non-default password for Intel® AMT or Intel® Standard Manageability immediately following receipt of the system from the systems manufacturer.

Additional guidance is provided at this [support page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000091553.html).

### Acknowledgements:

Intel would like to thank Seth W Dailey (Z-winK) for reporting this issue.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
