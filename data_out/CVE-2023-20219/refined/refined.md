- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input for certain configuration options in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection (CWE-78) and Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the device, including on the underlying operating system, potentially affecting the availability of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: By using crafted input within the device configuration GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid device credentials but does not require *Administrator* privileges. Remote access is needed.
