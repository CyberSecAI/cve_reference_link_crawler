```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses the 'urlAdd' parameter value and passes it to V2, then assigns V2 to V9. Finally, it uses the 'strcat' function to add V9 to the stack of v10, without any size checks, leading to a stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack overflow",
    "Command Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device, leading to code execution and privilege escalation to root shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request with a long 'urlAdd' parameter to the '/goform/websURLFilterAddDel' endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device's web interface. The device appears to be a router, so the attacker might need to be on the local network or have remote access to the router's web interface."
