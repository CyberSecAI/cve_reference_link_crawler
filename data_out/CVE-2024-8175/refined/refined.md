Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the CODESYS web server's failure to properly check the return value of an underlying function when processing TLS packets received over an HTTPS connection. This lack of error checking leads to incorrect handling of specifically crafted TLS packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions (CWE-754)
- The web server does not correctly validate the return value from a function involved in processing TLS packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The web server attempts to access invalid memory, causing the web server task to crash.
- This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, disrupting the availability of the web visualization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specifically crafted TLS packet to the CODESYS web server via an HTTPS connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the target device running the vulnerable CODESYS web server.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attack can be launched remotely.
