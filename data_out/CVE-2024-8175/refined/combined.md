CODESYS Security Advisory 2024-05

1  Overview

The CODESYS web server component of the CODESYS Control runtime system is used by the CODESYS
WebVisu to display visualization screens in a web browser. Receiving a specifically crafted TLS packet on an
HTTPS connection causes the CODESYS web server to crash because the return value of an underlying
function is not checked correctly for such unusual conditions.

2  Affected Products

The following products are affected in all versions before 3.5.20.30.
• CODESYS Control RTE (SL)
• CODESYS Control RTE (for Beckhoff CX) SL
• CODESYS Control Win (SL)
• CODESYS HMI (SL)
• CODESYS Runtime Toolkit
• CODESYS Embedded Target Visu Toolkit
• CODESYS Remote Target Visu Toolkit

The following products are affected in all versions before 4.14.0.0.
• CODESYS Control for BeagleBone SL
• CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6 SL
• CODESYS Control for IOT2000 SL
• CODESYS Control for Linux ARM SL
• CODESYS Control for Linux SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC100 SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC200 SL
• CODESYS Control for PLCnext SL
• CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL
• CODESYS Control for WAGO Touch Panels 600 SL
• CODESYS Virtual Control SL

3  Vulnerability Identifiers, Type and Severity

VDE-2024-057 [1]

CODESYS JIRA: CDS-89666, CDS-90549

CVE-2024-8175 [7]

CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions [8]

Impact

The CODESYS web server, implemented by the CmpWebServer component, is an optional part of the
CODESYS Control runtime system. It is used by the CODESYS WebVisu to display CODESYS visualization
screens in a web browser. The CODESYS web server supports both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Because
the CODESYS web server does not correctly check the return value of an underlying function, it reacts in a
wrong way to specifically crafted TLS packets that are received via an HTTPS connection. This causes the
CODESYS web server to access invalid memory and the web server task to crash.

5  Remediation

Update the following products to version 3.5.20.30.
• CODESYS Control RTE (SL)
• CODESYS Control RTE (for Beckhoff CX) SL
• CODESYS Control Win (SL)

6  General Security Recommendations

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH strongly recommends at least the following best-practice
defense measures:

• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside

• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks

• Activate and apply user management and password features

• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.

• Use encrypted communication links

• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required

• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions

For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [2].
