The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability in binutils, specifically in the `pr_function_type` function within the `prdbg.c` file.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - A memory leak occurs when a specific code path is taken within the `pr_function_type` function.
    - Specifically, when the true branch is selected, the program returns `FALSE` without freeing the allocated memory pointed to by 's'. The function call within the condition statement does not free `s` either.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unfreed dynamically allocated memory.
    - Incorrect handling of return paths within the function.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Memory leak leading to potential resource exhaustion if the vulnerable code path is repeatedly triggered.

- **Attack vectors:**
    -  Triggering the specific code path within the `pr_function_type` function that leads to the memory leak by supplying specific input data.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path, which might depend on the input provided to the binutils program.

The fix involved adding a `free(s)` call on the failure path within the `pr_function_type` function.
