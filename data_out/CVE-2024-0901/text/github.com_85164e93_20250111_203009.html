Build with asan. Reproduction steps  1. `export CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address` 2. `./configure --enable-tls13` 3. Use attached tls13.c to replace src/tls13.c, which modified BuildTls13Message at line 3193 and 3222, removing cert data and record type from record before encryption and hash.    [tls13.zip](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/files/13753151/tls13.zip) 4. `make` 5. `./examples/server/server -v 4 -i -x` 6. `./examples/client/client -v 4` 7. Asan reports SEGV on unknown address, if after many connections, asan may reports heap over flow.

| Hello [@hey3e](https://github.com/hey3e)  Can you reproduce this problem without modifying wolfssl? Can you let us know why you modified the code? |

| Sorry, I didn't explain clearly. We need to compile two wolfssl, one as server without modification, one as malicious client with modification. Reproduction steps **Server**   1. `git checkout -f 928dd7021` 2. `export CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address` 3. `./configure --enable-tls13` 4. `make` 5. `./examples/server/server -v 4 -i -x`   **Malicious client**   1. `git checkout -f 928dd7021` 2. Replace `src/tls13.c` 3. `./configure --enable-tls13` 4. `make` 5. `./examples/client/client -v 4`   In this case, technically we reproduced the problem without modifying wolfssl because the client is malicious in our attack model. Also the bug can be triggered without modifying client but it would be consuming because of encryption. I chose to leverage the client itself who originally can generate valid cryptographic packets. What I modify is just removing the cert data and record type of Certificate packet before its encryption. |

| Hey [@hey3e](https://github.com/hey3e),  It seems we failed to do a bounds check during the mac verify step and the bad sizes that came in as input were causing our index variable to be 0, which then wrapped around to 0xffff in the next step after it was decremented. Anyways I've added a bounds check to return an error when this happens, here is the PR [#7099](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7099). We'll close this issue once the PR has been merged, thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Best Wishes, John Bland |
