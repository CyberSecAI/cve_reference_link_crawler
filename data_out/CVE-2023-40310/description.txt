SAP PowerDesigner Client - version 16.7, does not sufficiently validate BPMN2 XML document imported from an untrusted source. As a result, URLs of external entities in BPMN2 file, although not used, would be accessed during import. A successful attack could impact availability of SAP PowerDesigner Client.
