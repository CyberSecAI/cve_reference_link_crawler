  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Delta Electronics CNCSoft-G2 lacks proper validation of user-supplied data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787). Specifically, the software does not validate user-supplied data, leading to memory corruption.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to a memory corruption condition and allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "A target visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file crafted by an attacker could trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make the target visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The attack has low complexity and requires user interaction."
