Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-36749:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `trackEdit.php` file of RPi-Jukebox-RFID v2.3.0.
*   The application constructs a shell command using user-supplied input (filename) without proper sanitization. Specifically the `$fileName` variable is built using `Files::buildPath` which simply concatenates the folder and filename using `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`.
*   This unsanitized filename is then injected into a `mid3v2` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands via the `filename` parameter.
*   The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`) to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   The output of the executed command is then parsed, and the values can be reflected in the response, leading to potential XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **XSS:** The output of the injected command is parsed, and certain values are reflected in the response. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if a malicious script is injected as part of the command.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** The high CVSS scores for confidentiality, integrity, and availability indicates that successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, meaning a remote attacker can exploit it.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `filename` parameter in HTTP GET or POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote, needing no special privileges or user interaction.
*   **Crafted Payload:** The attacker must craft a malicious payload within the `filename` parameter, including shell metacharacters and commands.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `htdocs/trackEdit.php` and `htdocs/utils/Files.php`.
*   The `Files::buildPath` function simply concatenates the folder and filename using the directory separator, making it vulnerable to path traversal and command injection.
*   The `$exec` variable in `trackEdit.php` constructs the command using user-controlled input, enabling command injection via the filename.
*   The output of the command is then parsed using `explode` and reflected back.
