Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper path handling within the Obsidian desktop application when processing `app://local/` URLs. This custom URL scheme is used to load local resources within markdown files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application uses `path.resolve` on the portion of the URL after `app://local/`, allowing absolute paths to be used. This enables an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the local file system.
*   **Insufficient Referrer Check:** The application attempts to prevent cross-origin access to local resources by checking the `referrer` header. However, this check can be bypassed by sending a request with an empty referrer, which can be achieved through Javascript.
*   **Insecure iframe handling:** The application does not properly sanitize or restrict iframes, allowing malicious web pages to be embedded and executed within Obsidian.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the victim's local file system. This allows access to sensitive information such as configuration files, personal documents and cryptographic keys.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can exfiltrate the contents of these files to remote servers.
*   **Data Integrity Compromise**:  Attackers can leverage `obsidian://new` to append or overwrite content in existing files, leading to data corruption or manipulation, and potentially making the vulnerability wormable by adding the same payload to other markdown files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Markdown Files:** An attacker can embed a malicious iframe within a markdown file. When the user opens the file in Obsidian, the iframe will be executed, potentially leading to file disclosure.
*   **Copy and Paste from Malicious Webpages:** An attacker can craft a webpage that injects the malicious iframe payload into the clipboard when the user copies any text from the site. When the user pastes the copied content into Obsidian, the payload is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious markdown file or copy/paste from a malicious webpage.
*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious content or receive exfiltrated data.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Obsidian desktop versions prior to 1.2.8.
*   The `app://local/` scheme was designed for loading local resources but was not properly secured.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
*   The vulnerability can be used to obtain sensitive information from Obsidian vaults (recent vaults, file lists, and contents).
*   The attacker can manipulate obsidian files through `obsidian://new` protocol scheme.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.2 (High).
