[1.2.8
 Desktop](/changelog/2023-05-03-desktop-v1.2.8/)

[catalyst](/pricing#catalyst)

## Breaking changes

* Removed support for `app://local` URLs. These were reported as a potential vulnerability when using iframes.

## No longer broken

* macOS: Text in the "Look up" menu item will now be trimmed to 40 characters.
* Bookmarks: New unnamed groups will now be called "Untitled group" instead of "Untitled folder"
* Bookmarks: Bookmark context menu items will now also refer to "Bookmark groups" instead of "folders" to avoid confusion.
* Bookmarks: Bookmark group must always have a title.

## Developers

* Fixed issue with `navigator.clipboard` API not working in popout windows.
* If you were relying on `app://local` for functionality within your plugin, you should use `vault.getResourcePath(file: TFile)` and `vault.adapter.getResourcePath(vaultPath: string)` as a replacement. These also works on mobile.
