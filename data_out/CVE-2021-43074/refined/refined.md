- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper verification of cryptographic signature during the decryption process of administrative session management cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Padding oracle vulnerability (CWE-347) due to lack of proper cryptographic signature verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie after intercepting it. This can lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must be able to intercept the administrative session management cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network such that they can intercept the administrative session management cookie. They also need to be familiar with padding oracle attacks.
