Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "Plugin for Google Reviews" WordPress plugin's shortcode. Specifically, the `place_id` attribute is not properly handled, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved in the database (via a WordPress post) and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize the `place_id` attribute of the shortcode, which means it does not remove or encode potentially harmful characters.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin also fails to escape the user-provided input when outputting the shortcode, which would prevent browser from interpreting the input as executable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **User Compromise:** This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking, stealing user cookies and sensitive data.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Plugin Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `[grw]` shortcode, specifically by manipulating the `place_id` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an authenticated account on the WordPress site with "contributor-level" or higher permissions to create or edit posts.
- **Ability to Add Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to be able to add shortcodes to post content.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is within the `includes/class-feed-shortcode.php` file. The patch introduces `esc_attr()` which will escape the value of place_id.
- An example of a malicious shortcode payload is provided: `[grw id="" place_id='asdf" onmouseover="alert(1)']`.
- The `place_id` attribute is directly used in the output of the plugin without sanitization or escaping.

**Additional Details**
- The fix was released in version 3.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Akbar Kustirama.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a stored XSS due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the shortcode handling of the "Plugin for Google Reviews". A contributor or higher can inject malicious javascript via the `place_id` attribute in the `[grw]` shortcode, which will be executed when a user views the page where the shortcode was included.
