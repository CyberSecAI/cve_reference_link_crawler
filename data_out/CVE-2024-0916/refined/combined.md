### @OneJumpRD **[OneJumpRD](/OneJumpRD)** commented [Jan 31, 2024](#issue-2110522585)

### 1. Why is this change necessary?

Improve security. For some reason although the app has the functionality to rename/sanitize the uploaded file names it is not being used since $renameFile defaults to false.

### 2. What does this change do, exactly?

Sets $renameFile to true on the function uploadFile from the localhost upload manager.

### 3. Please link to the relevant issues (if any).

Ticket number #32140 on uvdesk.com

Sorry, something went wrong.
