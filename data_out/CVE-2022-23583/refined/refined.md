{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a type confusion in binary operations within TensorFlow. When the data type (`dtype`) of tensor arguments in a SavedModel is modified to not match the expected `dtype` of an operation, it leads to the `flat<*>` method interpreting the data incorrectly. This can result in a `CHECK` failure and a denial-of-service (DoS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The core vulnerability is the lack of proper type checking before invoking templated binary operators. Specifically, the `dtype` of the input tensors is not validated against the expected `dtype` of the operation, leading to type confusion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user could cause a denial of service (DoS) by crafting a SavedModel that contains type mismatches in tensor arguments, causing the binary operators to fail with a `CHECK` crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves modifying the protobuf part of a SavedModel to alter the `dtype` of tensor arguments, which results in a type mismatch and subsequent crash during the execution of binary operations.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to modify the protobuf part of a `SavedModel`. This means they either have access to the `SavedModel` before it is used, or they are able to modify the `SavedModel` during transfer, if the transfer mechanism does not prevent modifications."
