This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Validate real and expected type of arguments to cwise ops.

Without this validation, it is possible to trigger a `CHECK`-fail denial of service.

This is a rollforward of a previous commit which was rolled back as it was relying on RTTI. This time we don't use RTTI, we replace `typeid(Tin).name()` with a double function call, `DataTypeString(DataTypeToEnum<Tin>::v())`.
