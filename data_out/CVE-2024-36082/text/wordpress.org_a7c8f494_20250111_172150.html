I find the Music Store plugin excellent. I’m very pleased with my purchase and really like its features. Installing tracks and albums is easy, and the shortcode’s flexibility is great. The tech support is outstanding. I highly recommend purchasing it; it’s definitely worth it.Tony

Plugin is a bit fiddly, but I guess if it was worth using, you’d figure it out. However, it is no good if you want to sell a full single, E.P or Album as it only allows 1 track per release. Not much use in the real world unless you pay for the Pro version sadly.
