Thanks to xxorax you can now configure the default permission for Subversion files on your server.

The new settings are:
```

;; svn files mod on creation
subversion.chmod = "0770"
;; svn repo/db/* directories mod (used on fcgi env)
subversion.chmod_db = "2770"

```

We also fix a bug in management of groups for an user. We also move the website on github pages, the hosting should be more reliable.

# [SVN Autocheckout](/2011/01/21/svn-autocheckout)

21 Jan 2011
Sebastian Buckpesch

Dear USVN-Team,

thanks a lot for your product. It helps me a lot to manage my SVN-Repository and projects. As a contribution to your work I send you my auto-commit files, which I think many developers are using.

What auto-commit does:
Each time someone is checking in a new version of a file to the repository, the file will be checked-out to the www-directory automatically, so that everybody can see the new version live on the test-/web-server. To get this functionality you need two files in the hooks-folder of a project:

* hooks/post-commit (you have to replace two variables, repository path and path to www-folder)
* hooks/bin/autocheckout.sh (has to be executable by post-commit: chmod +x)

Proposal to quick including autocheckout functionality:

1) When an admin creates a new project in usvn he can choose to use auto-checkout. If so, he has to enter the server path to his www-directory he wants to checkout the files to.

2) After saving you include the two attached files into the repository template (folder hooks) and replace the two variables in post-commit-file (repo-path and www-path)

That's it! I think it's not so complicated to include and would help many users.

THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR PRODUCT!!!

Best Regards from Dublin,

Sebastian

Starting now we will accept PHP 5.2.X features into our codebase and our
new feature releases will no longer provide support for older PHP versions.

USVN is already fully compatible with all the PHP 5.X versions and
doesn't support PHP 4 but next versions will require PHP 5.2.X because we
use some functions of this version related to dates.
