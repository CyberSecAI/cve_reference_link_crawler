### Description

**Update:** 2022/04/08 23:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time, +0 hours)

* Assigned CVE-2022-26133 to this vulnerability, which was determined to be similar to CVE-2016-10750 yet slightly different and specific to Bitbucket
* Note the new CVE assignment does not change any other information in this advisory. The existing list of affected and fixed versions remains unchanged and accurate

### Vulnerability Details

Bitbucket Data Center uses the third-party software Hazelcast, which is vulnerable to Java deserialization attacks ([CVE-2022-26133](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10750)). Hazelcast provides functionality needed to run Bitbucket Data Center as a cluster. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

### Affected Versions

![](/images/icons/emoticons/information.png) Bitbucket Server is **not** affected.

![](/images/icons/emoticons/information.png) Bitbucket Cloud is **not** affected.

Both single and multi-node installations of Bitbucket Data Center are affected. Enabling or disabling clustering does not affect whether or not the application is vulnerable.

The following versions are affected:

* All 5.x versions >= 5.14.x
* All 6.x versions
* All 7.x versions < 7.6.14
* All versions 7.7.x through 7.16.x
* 7.17.x < 7.17.6
* 7.18.x < 7.18.4
* 7.19.x < 7.19.4
* 7.20.0

### Fixed Versions

The following versions of Bitbucket Data Center fix this vulnerability:

* 7.6.14
* 7.17.6
* 7.18.4
* 7.19.4
* 7.20.1
* 7.21.0

Find the versions above on our [downloads page](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives) and use the steps outlined in the [Bitbucket upgrade guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-upgrade-guide-776640551.html) to complete the upgrade.

If you are unable to install a fixed version, refer to the “Workaround” section below.

### Workaround

Restrict access to the Hazelcast port by using a firewall or other network access controls. The port only needs to be accessible by other nodes in the Bitbucket or Confluence cluster. Bitbucket Data Center configures Hazelcast to use [TCP port 5701 by default](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-data-center-requirements-913477100.html).

### Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge Benny Jacob (SnowyOwl) for reporting this vulnerability.

## Summary of Vulnerability

Multiple Atlassian products use the third-party software Hazelcast, which is vulnerable to Java deserialization attacks. Hazelcast is used by these products when they’re configured to run as a cluster. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

## Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels "https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels"). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

## Affected Bitbucket Data Center Versions

* Bitbucket Server is **not** affected.
* Bitbucket Cloud is **not** affected.

Both single and multi-node installations of Bitbucket Data Center are affected. Enabling or disabling clustering does not affect whether or not the application is vulnerable.

The following versions of Bitbucket Data Center are affected:

* All 5.x versions >= 5.14.x
* All 6.x versions
* All 7.x versions < 7.6.14
* All versions 7.7.x through 7.16.x
* 7.17.x < 7.17.6
* 7.18.x < 7.18.4
* 7.19.x < 7.19.4
* 7.20.0

## Fixed Bitbucket Data Center Versions

The following versions of Bitbucket Data Center fix this vulnerability:

* 7.6.14
* 7.17.6
* 7.18.4
* 7.19.4
* 7.20.1
* 7.21.0

Find the versions above on our [downloads page](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives) and use the steps outlined in the [Bitbucket upgrade guide](/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-upgrade-guide-776640551.html) to complete the upgrade.

If you are unable to install a fixed version, refer to the “Workaround” section below.

## Affected Confluence Data Center Versions

* Confluence Data Center instances that are **not** installed as a cluster are **not** affected.
* Confluence Server is **not** affected.
* Confluence Cloud is **not** affected.

Confluence Data Center is only affected when it is installed as a cluster. To verify whether a cluster installation is being used, check the `confluence.cfg.xml` file in the [Confluence home directory](/doc/confluence-home-and-other-important-directories-590259707.html). If the following line is present, it has been installed as a cluster:

```
<property name="confluence.cluster">true</property>
```

If the line is not present *or* if the value is set to `false` instead of `true`, it has **not** been installed as a cluster.

The following versions of Confluence Data Center are affected when clustering is enabled:

* All versions 5.6.x and later

## Fixed Confluence Data Center Versions

The following versions of Confluence Data Center fix this vulnerability:

* 7.4.17
* 7.13.7
* 7.14.3
* 7.15.2
* 7.16.4
* 7.17.4

STATUS

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to the latest Long Term Support release. For a full description of the latest version, see the [Confluence Server and Data Center Release Notes](/conf65/confluence-release-notes-939702073.html). You can download the latest version from the [download centre](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives "https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives").

Note: If you run Confluence in a cluster, you will not be able to upgrade to these versions without downtime, also known as a rolling upgrade. Follow the steps in [Upgrading Confluence Data Center](/doc/upgrading-confluence-data-center-1507377.html).

## Workaround

Restrict access to the Hazelcast port by using a firewall or other network access controls. The port only needs to be accessible by other nodes in the Bitbucket or Confluence cluster.

For Bitbucket Data Center, [Hazelcast uses TCP port 5701 by default](/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-data-center-requirements-913477100.html).

For Confluence Data Center, [Hazelcast uses both TCP ports 5701 and 5801 by default](/doc/set-up-a-confluence-data-center-cluster-982322030.html#SetupaConfluenceDataCentercluster-security).
