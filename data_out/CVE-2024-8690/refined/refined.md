- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the detection mechanism of the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent on Windows allows a local administrator to disable the agent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is related to a violation of expected behavior (CWE-440) where the agent's detection mechanism can be bypassed by a local administrator.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker with local administrator privileges to disable the Cortex XDR agent, potentially allowing them to perform malicious activities without detection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have administrator privileges on the Windows device where the agent is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have local administrator privileges on the affected Windows system.
