- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality in the web-based UI of the Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 device. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for critical functions in the web interface.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the affected system. Additionally, the CVSS score suggests a potential for low impact on integrity (I:L) and high impact on availability (A:H).

- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability through the web-based UI.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the affected DSE855 device. No prior authentication is required.
