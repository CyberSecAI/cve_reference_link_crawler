{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of data length validation in the soft bus (communication_ipc) component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system does not check the length of the data being processed, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is 'near-field', which suggests a local or adjacent network attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a near-field position to exploit this vulnerability."
