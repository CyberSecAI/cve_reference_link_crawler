- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input within web requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerabilities allow access to files and data that should not be accessible to a regular user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files and data.
- **Attack vectors:**  Specifically crafted web requests are used to exploit the path traversal vulnerabilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A regular user with the ability to make web requests is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
