Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2024-33442:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is an unauthorized access issue within the `/core/tools/add_post.php` endpoint of Flusity-CMS v2.33.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control, allowing ordinary users to potentially execute functionality intended for administrators.
*   **Impact:** A regular user (cs2), without proper authorization, can bypass access restrictions and execute the functionality available at `/core/tools/add_post.php`. The specific impact of this functionality is not detailed, but it involves actions an ordinary user should not be able to perform, based on the provided context. This could lead to unauthorized content creation, modification, or other actions depending on the function of add\_post.php.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via a direct web request to the `/core/tools/add_post.php` endpoint.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs a regular user account to perform the attack, making it an authenticated attack rather than requiring an admin account.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content explicitly states, "By using the permissions of CS2 to execute, this function can be successfully exceeded." This confirms that the access control bypass is the core issue.
*   The provided screenshots appear to demonstrate the successful bypass of restrictions and access to the functionality.
*   The vulnerability affects Flusity-CMS version 2.33.
