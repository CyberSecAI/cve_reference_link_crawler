Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper authentication in the `/dashboard/settings` endpoint of the SourceCodester Company Website CMS 1.0. The application fails to properly verify the identity of the user attempting to modify site settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The system does not adequately authenticate the user before allowing modifications to site settings. Specifically, the application does not check if the user is logged in or has the correct permissions before allowing the update to the settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized users can access and view sensitive site settings.
*   **Integrity:** Attackers can modify site settings, potentially leading to a defaced or malfunctioning website.
*  **Availability:** By modifying the website settings, attackers can render the website unavailable for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/dashboard/settings` endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The payload uses multipart/form-data to send modified site settings parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to be logged in or provide any credentials to exploit the vulnerability, due to the missing authentication check.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of crafting HTTP POST requests with multipart/form-data.

**Technical Details:**

* The provided exploit code demonstrates how to send a POST request with modified parameters such as `site_title`, `site_keyword`, `site_desc`, etc., to the `/dashboard/settings` endpoint without any prior authentication.
*   By sending this request, the attacker can change the website's title and other settings as well, which affects the front-end display of the website.

**Additional Notes:**
*   A Proof of Concept exploit is available publicly, increasing the likelihood of attacks.
*  There are no known countermeasures or patches mentioned.
*  The provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description which just states "improper authentication."
