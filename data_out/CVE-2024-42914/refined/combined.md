# CVE-2024-42914: Host Header Injection in Forgot Password of ArrowCMS version 1.0.0

A host header injection vulnerability exists in the forgot password functionality of ArrowCMS version 1.0.0 . By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users' passwords.

PoC:

* We trigger the reset password functionality for an existing user, such as `victim@email.com`, and provide a malicious host header: `Host: attacker-controlled.com`
* This sends a password reset email to `victim@email.com`
* Note the host being `attacker-controlled.com`
* When `victim` clicks the link and attempts to use the password reset token, the token is leaked to the attacker which would allow resetting `victim's` password and taking over his account

Discovered by Sourajeet Majumder, August 2024.
