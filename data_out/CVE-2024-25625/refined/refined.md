Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-25625.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `invitationLinkAction` function within `UserController.php`. The application unsafely uses the host header from incoming HTTP requests to generate URLs. It does not validate the host header before using it to construct the `$loginUrl`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Host Header Injection: The application trusts user-supplied input in the Host header to create URLs without validation.
- Unvalidated Input:  The `$loginUrl` is built with a host header directly from the incoming request, which may be manipulated by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Phishing Attacks: By manipulating the Host header, an attacker can cause the invitation links in emails to point to their malicious domain. This allows for phishing attacks where users could be tricked into providing credentials on a fake login page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `/admin/user/invitationlink` endpoint.
- Attackers can manipulate the Host header of HTTP POST requests sent to this endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/user/invitationlink` endpoint with a malicious Host header.
- The attacker needs to know the username of a valid user to generate an invitation link.
- The attacker needs to have network access to reach the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker must have high privileges as this endpoint is part of the admin section.
