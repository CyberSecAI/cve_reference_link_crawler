Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the installer of the Zoom Workplace App and Zoom Rooms App for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The installer has a flaw where multiple processes or threads can access and modify shared resources concurrently, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service. The attacker can cause the application to become unstable, crash, or become unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system, meaning they need to have a valid user account on the Windows machine.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) meaning some action from the user is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the target Windows system.
- They need the ability to run code or interact with the system in a way that can trigger the race condition in the Zoom installer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Zoom Workplace Desktop App for Windows before version 6.0.10 and Zoom Rooms App for Windows before version 6.0.6.
- The CVSS score is 6.6 which is considered a medium severity.
- The provided CVSS vector string is: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H which translates to Local attack vector, low attack complexity, low privileges required, user interaction, scope unchanged, no impact to confidentiality, high impact to integrity and high impact to availability.

**Mitigation:**
- Users are advised to update to the latest versions of the Zoom Workplace App for Windows (6.0.10 or later) and Zoom Rooms App for Windows (6.0.6 or later).
