The provided content relates to a fix for a potential panic in the Linux kernel when no valid Flattened Device Tree (FDT) is found. This directly relates to CVE-2021-47134, as the issue is an improper handling of a null FDT pointer.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `efi_get_fdt_params()` function in `drivers/firmware/efi/fdtparams.c` was not checking if a valid FDT was found before attempting to process it.
- When `setup_arch()` calls `efi_init()->efi_get_fdt_params()`, if no valid FDT is found, `initial_boot_params` will be null. The function then proceeds to use this null pointer causing a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of null pointer check: The code does not validate the FDT pointer before dereferencing it, leading to a potential dereference of a null pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel Panic: The primary impact of this vulnerability is a kernel panic, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the lack of a valid FDT when the system attempts to boot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to control the boot environment such that no valid FDT is provided to the kernel. This might be possible if the attacker can manipulate the boot process of a target machine. This is especially relevant for architectures like RISC-V, where the issue was encountered.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix adds a check to see if the `fdt` pointer is valid before proceeding with FDT processing within the `efi_get_fdt_params()` function.
- The fix was introduced in commit `668a84c1bfb2b3fd5a10847825a854d63fac7baa`, and then backported.
- The issue was encountered on the RISC-V architecture, though it is not necessarily limited to that architecture.
- The patch adds a simple check: `if (!fdt) return 0;`.
