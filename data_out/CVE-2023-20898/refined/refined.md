Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-20898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Git Providers in Salt use the same cache directory base name, even when used with different environments. This is because the environment information was not included in the hash that generates the cache directory base name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate cache directory naming:  The lack of environment information in the cache directory name leads to different environments sharing the same cache.
- Potential race conditions: Git Providers locking mechanism had potential race conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Corruption: Using the wrong cache can lead to incorrect data being used.
- Wrongful Data Disclosure: Data from one environment could be exposed in another.
- Wrongful Executions: Incorrect data can lead to wrong commands being executed.
- System Crashes: In some cases, the incorrect data usage can lead to system crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation involves using Git Providers with different environments, that are sharing same cache directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to use the Git Providers in Salt with multiple, different environments.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the usage of git providers with different environments.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves including environment information in the hash that generates the cache directory base name, ensuring each environment gets its own cache. A multiprocessing lock was also added to mitigate potential locking race conditions.
- This vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 score of 4.2, with a vector of AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, meaning it has a low impact in terms of confidentiality and integrity, and there is no impact on availability.
- The vulnerability is considered to be of "Medium" severity.
