### Can I use your eCommerce software to display, but not sell products?

Absolutely! If you do not need to sell anything, but would like to leverage our software to display products, please feel free to do just that! You can just put the store into catalog mode and it removes the ability to add to cart the products.

### Can I sell my products on Facebook & Instagram?

Yes! With our Premium edition, you can use our Facebook & Instagram feed to publish your products into a Facebook Catalog. This lets you setup a catalog of products on Facebook, create compelling carousal ads across social media, and more!

### What are the PRO and Premium eCommerce Versions?

The FREE version comes right here on WordPress and offers limited features for you including the abiliyt to have a PayPal cart, Square cart, Stripe cart, manual payments, unlimited products, product variations, order management, and so much more. Features such as coupons, live shipping rates, promotions, order editing, 30+ gateways, live shipping carriers, and many more are not included in the FREE version.

I was able to get my WP EasyCart store up and running quickly and easily. The templates and information on their knowledge base was very helpful as I had to troubleshoot some minor configuration issues. I did have to submit a couple technical work order requests for help with the shipping application that interacts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS External sites and the technical support team was very quick to answer and help me with some answers to help with my integration. Overall, the product and support has been a great experience.

I have always used woocommerce for e-com sites. And it’s always a huge pain getting things to look right. And if you want any flexibility at all, it’s also costly to buy all the necessary add-ons.
I found EasyCart when I was looking for a solution to a basic customization for Woo – that literally is not possible without writing js. Not only does EC solve my original issue, but it is feature-rich and easy to set up and customize.
I had a question about how to make something work a certain way, so I emailed EC support, and they replied quickly and understood exactly what I needed.
In a world where it often seems like nothing works the way it’s supposed to, EasyCart is a breath of fresh air.

I’m a noob when it comes to creating and managing websites. But when I was assigned the task by our High School reunion committee, I had some learnin’ to do. It had been years since I developed a website and adding ecommerce to the site so that classmates could purchase tickets was completely new to me. I tried WooCommerce but didn’t find it very intuitive and quickly grew tired of having to install additional plugins to get everything to work.
Finally I decided to ditch Woo and find another eStore plugin and that’s when I discovered WPEasyCart. Within minutes I had products and in no time at all added various payment processing options to my site. The interface is very intuitive and doesn’t require a lot of reading documentation to navigate through configuring your store.
Thanks WP EasyCart!

We have been using WPEasy Cart since 2018 on our website design/builds and recommend this plugin to all of our ecommerce clients. The interfaces for payment and shipping are suitable for all types of businesses. Josh, in support, is responsive and always very helpful when we need to perform some customization or nonstandard cart configurations. Thank you, Josh!

Working with WP Easy Cart installed on my site has been very smooth during the installation process. I am new to WP seeing I mainly did Joomla and Josh’s help during the installation and modification I needed was extremely helpful. On the spot responses to my questions but I did need to do some research being new to WP. EasyCart has many options built in so you don’t need to spend a lot of extra money on extension that other ecommerce shops don’t provide. The one important thing I have learned is choosing the correct WP Theme for EasyCart or you will have a few issues with how the store looks.

When I first started building and managing WordPress based eCommerce Solutions, over a decade ago, I found WP EasyCart. It’s been the best find of my career. Their solution is not only comprehensive, it is highly compatible with third party themes and plugins, and there’s always fantastic support. Responsive, knowledgeable superstars! Glad they’re doing what they do.
