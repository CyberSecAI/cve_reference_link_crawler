The provided content relates to a bug fix in the Linux kernel's arm64 architecture, specifically within the Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) functionality. This fix addresses a memory leak and state corruption issue in the `sme_alloc()` function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `sme_alloc()` function was allocating new storage even when existing storage was present and flushing wasn't required. This happened because the check for existing storage was not separated from the check for flushing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The old storage was not being freed when a new allocation occurred when it shouldn't have.
- State corruption: Allocating new storage over existing storage without properly managing the old one corrupts the internal state of the SME.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated calls to `sme_alloc` without freeing existing storage could lead to memory exhaustion and potentially system instability.
- State corruption could lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect calculations, or program crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or buggy application that repeatedly calls `sme_alloc` could trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to execute code that uses SME on an affected system.

The fix involves separating the check for existing storage from the check for flushing. The `sme_alloc()` now exits early if `task->thread.sme_state` exists and no flush is requested, preventing unnecessary allocations and the related problems.
