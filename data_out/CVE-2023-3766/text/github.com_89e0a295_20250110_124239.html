### @cjpatton **[cjpatton](/cjpatton)** commented [Jul 14, 2023](#issue-1805165239)

If the encrypted message field is too short to include the encapsulated key, then `decrypt_query()` will panic. Instead it should return an error since this condition is triggered by the sender.

Sorry, something went wrong.
