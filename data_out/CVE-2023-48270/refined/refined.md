- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `set_DnsParam` function when copying the `routername` parameter from an HTTP request into the `routerName` field of the `dnsCfgParam` struct without proper bounds checking.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the use of `strcpy` without validating the length of the input string.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. The provided crash information shows that the program counter ($pc) and stack pointer ($sp) are overwritten with "A"s indicating successful control of program execution.

- **Attack vectors**: Network requests to the `/boafrm/formDnsv6` API of the vulnerable device's web server (boa).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
  - The attacker needs to know valid credentials to bypass authentication (default credentials were used in the provided PoC, but other valid credentials will work).
  - The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests to the `/boafrm/formDnsv6` endpoint with the `enable_dnsv6` parameter set to 1 and a `routername` parameter with a string length that exceeds the buffer size.
