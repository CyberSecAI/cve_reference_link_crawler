The content is related to CVE-2022-30320.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected product uses the S-Bus "write byte" message to a specific address and supplies a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16, which is not cryptographically secure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for manipulation of the controller configuration.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker on the adjacent network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network and be able to observe network traffic.
