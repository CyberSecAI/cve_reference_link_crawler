{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an improper validation of sequence numbers within a received RTPS heartbeat message. Specifically, the code attempts to decrement the `firstSN` (first sequence number) by 1 without properly checking if `firstSN.low` is 0 which leads to an assertion failure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation leading to a reachable assertion failure."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a remote crash of any Fast-DDS process.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a specially crafted RTPS heartbeat message with invalid sequence numbers to the target system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a Fast-DDS process."
