Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2017-17543:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is the insecure storage of VPN credentials by FortiClient. These credentials are not properly secured and are encrypted using an unsafe method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Storage:** VPN credentials are saved in locations where they are not adequately protected.
*   **Unsafe Encryption:** The encryption method used to store the credentials is weak and can be easily broken.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to stored VPN credentials, potentially allowing them to impersonate legitimate users and gain access to the VPN network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves gaining access to the system where the FortiClient software is installed and then obtaining the stored credentials. This could involve physical access or remote access, depending on the attacker's capabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **System Access:** Attackers need to have some level of access to the computer where FortiClient is installed to retrieve the improperly stored credentials. This could involve having physical access to the machine or having remote access via some other exploit.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker would need some level of technical skill to find the stored credentials and potentially decrypt them if they are encrypted (even with an unsafe method).

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects FortiClient for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux (SSLVPN) versions 5.6.0 and below.
*   The fix for this issue is upgrading to version 5.6.1 for Windows/Mac and 4.4.2336 (released with FortiOS 6.0.0) for Linux.
*   A workaround is provided which involves disabling the "Save Password" feature within FortiOS, and removing any cached credentials on the machine by uninstalling and reinstalling Forticlient.
*   The issue was reported by M. Li of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab and Ci&T Software S/A Brazil.
