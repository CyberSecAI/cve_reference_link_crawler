The Motors â€“ Car Dealer, Classifieds & Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the stm_edit_delete_user_car function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to unpublish arbitrary posts and pages.
