### Description

The Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid & Carousel, Remote Arrows) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Form Submission Admin Email Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.3. This is due to the plugin not properly checking for all variations of an administrators emails. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the restriction using a +value when submitting the contact form.
