## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/Masterminds/vcs` to version 1.13.3 or higher.

## Overview

[github.com/Masterminds/vcs](https://github.com/Masterminds/vcs) is a VCS Repo management through a common interface in Go.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When `hg` is executed, argument strings are passed to `hg` in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.

## PoC

```
package main

import (
    "github.com/Masterminds/vcs"
)

func main(){
      local := "--config=alias.init=!touch ./HELLO"
    repo, _ := vcs.NewHgRepo("remote", local)
    repo.Init()
}

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

## Package

gomod

github.com/Masterminds/vcs
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.13.2

## Patched versions

1.13.2

## Description

URLs and local file paths passed to the Mercurial (hg) APIs that are specially crafted can contain commands which are executed by Mercurial if it is installed on the host operating system. The `vcs` package uses the underly version control system, in this case `hg`, to implement the needed functionality. When `hg` is executed, argument strings are passed to `hg` in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection. Other version control systems with an implemented interface may also be vulnerable. The issue has been fixed in version 1.13.2. A work around is to sanitize data passed to the `vcs` package APIs to ensure it does not contain commands or unexpected data. This is important for user input data that is passed directly to the package APIs.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
