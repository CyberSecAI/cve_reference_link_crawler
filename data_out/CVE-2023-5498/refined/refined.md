Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The commit `7de93f5fcc21e8f16fa0a64d38461c1b48ff3ee7` addresses a missing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token in the admin task completion view. The original code allowed a GET request to change the state of an admin task (complete/reopen), which is a security risk. 
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of CSRF protection on the admin task completion action. Without CSRF protection, an attacker could potentially trick a logged-in administrator into inadvertently changing the completion status of a task, by having them visit a crafted malicious webpage.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this by forcing an administrator to unknowingly change the state of admin tasks, possibly disrupting workflow or leading to other security issues. The attacker can craft a malicious HTML page or link that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, would trigger the task completion action.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious webpage or link that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, triggers the vulnerable endpoint for changing admin tasks' completion status.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to induce an authenticated administrator into visiting a crafted malicious page. The attacker does not need direct access to the application server.

**Details from the provided diffs:**

*   **`back/admin/admin_tasks/templates/admin_tasks_detail.html`**:  The change adds a `form` with `method="post"` and includes `{% csrf_token %}`. This ensures that a valid CSRF token is included in the request when submitting the form, mitigating the vulnerability. The previous version uses an `<a>` tag (a GET request) that did not provide CSRF protection.
*   **`back/admin/admin_tasks/tests.py`**:  The test was modified to ensure the `POST` request to the complete URL works, not a GET request as it did before. This confirms the intended behavior after applying the fix.
*   **`back/admin/admin_tasks/views.py`**: The code was changed to expect a POST request, not a GET request to toggle the task status. The view now inherits from `BaseDetailView` and uses the `post` method for modifying the state, ensuring that the request is not carried out just by navigating the browser to the given URL.

**Summary**
The commit fixes a CSRF vulnerability by changing the admin task completion process to use a POST request with CSRF protection instead of a GET request. This prevents unauthorized state changes of tasks through malicious requests.
