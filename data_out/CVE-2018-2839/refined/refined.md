    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Oracle MySQL. MySQL versions through 5.5.59, through 5.6.39 and through 5.7.21 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.",
