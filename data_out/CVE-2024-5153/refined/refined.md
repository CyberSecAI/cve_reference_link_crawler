Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5153

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and validation of the `dropzone_hash` parameter in the Startklar Elementor Addons plugin. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path used to store and access uploaded files, leading to path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `dropzone_hash` parameter, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The plugin uses a predictable directory structure for temporary file storage, making it easier for attackers to target specific locations.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Copying:** Attackers can copy the contents of any file on the server that the web server process has access to. This could expose sensitive information, such as configuration files or database credentials.
*   **Arbitrary Directory Deletion:** Attackers can delete arbitrary directories on the server, including the WordPress root directory. This can result in complete loss of website availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the `dropzone_hash` parameter when uploading files using the plugin's dropzone functionality. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can traverse the file system.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by any user, even unauthenticated ones.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileges.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the affected web server that includes the malicious `dropzone_hash` parameter.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Startklar Elementor Addons plugin up to and including 1.7.15.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `dropzone_form_field.php` file, specifically within the `sanitize_field` function.
*   The plugin uses the `glob()` function with user-controlled input to list files, and then performs actions such as `copy()` and `delete()` based on user-controlled paths, enabling the exploitation.
