The Startklar Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.15 via the 'dropzone_hash' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to copy the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information, and to delete arbitrary directories, including the root WordPress directory.
