The provided content contains information about CVE-2024-2918.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Improper input validation in the PAM JIT elevation feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of input data within the PAM JIT (Privileged Access Management Just-In-Time) elevation feature of Devolutions Server. Specifically, an attacker can manipulate the group displayed during a PAM JIT elevation checkout request by crafting a malicious request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the PAM JIT elevation feature can forge the displayed group in the PAM JIT elevation checkout request. Although the vulnerability description does not explicitly state the impact, it could mislead users or potentially be leveraged for further attacks. The CVSS score indicates high impact on Integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, requiring a malicious request targeting the PAM JIT elevation feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have legitimate access to the PAM JIT elevation feature to exploit the vulnerability. This suggests that they would need some level of authenticated access within the Devolutions Server environment, but not necessarily administrative privileges.
