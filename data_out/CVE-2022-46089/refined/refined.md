  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A lack of input sanitization in the add-airline form allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to unsanitized user input.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when an admin adds an airline with a crafted HTML tag as the airline name through the add-airline form in the admin panel.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the admin panel and add an airline with a malicious payload."
