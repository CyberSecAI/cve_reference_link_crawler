  "CVE-2024-33345": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `main` function of `upload_firmware.cgi` when handling the uploaded firmware file. Specifically, if the `sub_400EB4` function fails to open the uploaded file (controlled by the `UPLOAD_FILENAME` parameter), it returns 0 which results in a null pointer passed to `strncmp` causing a crash.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Null pointer dereference",
        "Lack of proper error handling"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The router crashes, leading to service interruption.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/upload_firmware.cgi`. The attacker manipulates the `UPLOAD_FILENAME` parameter by providing a non-existent filename or an empty value in a multipart/form-data request.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. Authentication may be required, but the provided information does not specify if this is required."
