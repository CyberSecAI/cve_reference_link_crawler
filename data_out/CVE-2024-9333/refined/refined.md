- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect access control list (ACL) calculation in M-Files Connector for Copilot. Specifically, metadata-based permissions were not correctly evaluated, leading to a permission bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Preservation of Permissions (CWE-281), Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels (CAPEC-180). The vulnerability lies in the flawed logic of access control calculation, where certain scenarios, specifically when metadata-based permissions are involved, can cause a bypass
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user with low privileges can gain unauthorized access to a limited number of documents, which they should not have access to. The confidentiality is impacted, whereas there is no impact on integrity and availability
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks by exploiting the permission bypass through the M-Files Connector for Copilot.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user with low privileges. The attacker needs to have an account in M-Files.
