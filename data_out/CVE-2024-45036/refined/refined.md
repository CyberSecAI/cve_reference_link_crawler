Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `tophat` tool handled artifact retrieval using a remote API endpoint. Specifically, the tool did not properly validate the server to which it was sending the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN`. This allowed an attacker to craft a malicious Tophat URL that would direct the tool to send the token to an attacker-controlled server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control in validating the destination server for sending the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN`. This token, stored in `~/.tophatrc`, was meant to be used to access build artifacts but was sent to an untrusted location.
- **Lack of Server Trust Verification:** The tool did not verify the legitimacy of the server specified in the Tophat URL, leading to the token being exposed to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` could be exposed, allowing the attacker to potentially access internal build artifacts, including those for mobile applications. This could lead to the unauthorized distribution and reverse engineering of proprietary mobile apps.
- **Loss of Confidentiality (Low):** The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality since unauthorized access to internal build artifacts is possible but not guaranteed to have high-level repercussions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (N):** The attack is performed over the network as the malicious URL is used to redirect token to attacker-controlled server.
- **Malicious Tophat URL:** An attacker creates a specifically crafted Tophat URL that when processed by the vulnerable `tophat` tool would redirect the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` to the attacker controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** An attacker would need to be able to host a server and craft a Tophat URL that would direct the vulnerable tool towards it.
- **Social Engineering (Limited):** The attacker would need to trick a user into using the malicious Tophat URL with a vulnerable version of the `tophat` tool installed to obtain the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN`. This could be as simple as a link in a message or other form of communication.
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the user's system to carry out the attack.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user needs to interact (e.g. click/open) with the malicious crafted URL for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.10.0 by deprecating the ability to request artifacts via an API endpoint, thus removing the insecure flow.
- Affected versions are those below 1.10.0.
- The advisory includes a CVSS v3 score of 4.3/10 with the vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
- The issue is tracked as GHSA-p7xh-6hjr-mmg6 on GitHub.
- The fix is linked to pull request #10 on the Shopify/tophat repository.
- The security advisory labels the issue with "Hackerone" and "security" tags.
