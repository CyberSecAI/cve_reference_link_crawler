### @lfroms **[lfroms](/lfroms)** commented [Aug 26, 2024](#issue-2487231566)

### What does this change accomplish?

Using an API endpoint on a remote server can be handy, but it does require an organization to potentially need to lower their security standards on the web service that hosts these endpoints to just basic HTTP authentication. This change deprecates and removes the ability to retrieve artifacts this way in favour of the classic URL method which doesn't require additional APIs to be exposed on potentially sensitive services.

### How have you achieved it?

By deleting all API endpoint based artifact retrieval.

### How can the change be tested?

1. Build and run Tophat.
2. Ensure there that the API endpoint based retrieval is gone from the app.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Improper Access Control Vulnerability When Accessing a Maliciously Crafted Tophat Link

Moderate

[lfroms](/lfroms)
published
GHSA-p7xh-6hjr-mmg6
Aug 26, 2024

## Package

swift

Tophat
([Swift](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aswift))

## Affected versions

< 1.10.0

## Patched versions

1.10.0

## Description

### Impact

An Improper Access Control vulnerability can expose the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` token stored in `~/.tophatrc` through use of a malicious Tophat URL controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability allows Tophat to send this token to the attacker's server without any checks to ensure that the server is trusted. This token can then be used to access internal build artifacts, for mobile applications, not intended to be public.

### Patches

The issue has been patched as of version 1.10.0. The ability to request artifacts using a Tophat API has been deprecated as this flow was inherently insecure. Systems that have implemented this kind of endpoint should cease use and invalidate the token immediately.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds and all users should update as soon as possible.

### References

Fixed in PR: [#10](https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/pull/10)

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
