- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient session expiration. A secure websocket session remains active even after the API admin user is deleted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can maintain an active websocket session after the associated admin account has been deleted, potentially allowing them to execute unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Through the FortiOS REST API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an established, secure websocket session with the FortiOS API prior to the deletion of the admin user associated with the session.
