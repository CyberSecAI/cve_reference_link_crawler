{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-9784",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `formResetStatistic` function of the D-Link DIR-619L B1 2.06 firmware. The `Var` variable receives the `curTime` parameter from a POST request, and the `sprintf` function is used to write this input into a buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow: User-controlled input is used in sprintf without proper size validation, leading to the possibility of writing beyond the allocated buffer."
    ],
    "impact": "The buffer overflow vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device, potentially taking control of the device. The impact could include denial of service, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `goform/formResetStatistic` endpoint with a specially crafted `curTime` parameter."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. This may require network access to the device, which could be LAN access, or access via a publicly exposed management interface if not properly protected.",
        "The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the parameter used."
      ]
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "affected_versions": [
      "D-Link DIR-619L B1 2.06"
    ],
    "poc": "A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit script written in Python is provided, demonstrating how to send a POST request with an oversized curTime parameter to trigger the buffer overflow. The script is able to send the HTTP request after a successful login, though the login part is commented out in the example."
