{
  "CVE-2020-27633": {
    "description": "FNET software is initialized with a consistent value and has consistent increments when generating initial sequence numbers (ISN), which may allow an attacker to spoof or disrupt TCP connections.",
    "root_cause": "The FNET software uses a consistent initial value and increments for generating Initial Sequence Numbers (ISN). This makes the sequence predictable.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of Insufficiently Random Values (CWE-330)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of weak initial sequence numbers (ISN) can be used to hijack or spoof TCP connections, cause denial-of-service conditions, inject malicious data, or bypass authentication.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks by predicting ISN"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to observe network traffic and predict ISNs to perform the attack."
