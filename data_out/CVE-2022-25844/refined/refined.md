    "description": "AngularJS versions 1.7.0 and higher are vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). By providing a custom locale rule, specifically manipulating the `posPre` parameter in `NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre` with a high value, an attacker can trigger catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine. This results in excessive CPU usage and can cause a denial of service."
