Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a business logic error in the `cart.php` file of a mobile management store. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input when updating the quantity of items in the shopping cart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application accepts negative values for the `quantity` parameter in the `update_cart_qty` function without proper checks. This allows users to manipulate the quantity of items in the cart to negative values.
*   **Business Logic Flaw:** The system's logic assumes that the quantity will always be a positive number, and does not account for cases where a negative value is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Financial Loss:** By setting a negative quantity for a product, an attacker can effectively reduce the total cost of their order, or manipulate the cart in a way that leads to a profit for them at the store's expense. For example, if a product costs $10 and they set the quantity to -1, the cart calculation may deduct $10 from the total cost instead of adding it, resulting in a discount or even a negative balance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can directly manipulate the HTTP POST request to the `/mobile_store/classes/Master.php?f=update_cart_qty` endpoint.
*   **`quantity` Parameter:** The attacker modifies the `quantity` parameter to a negative value in the request body (`id=3&quantity=-1` in the provided example).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Access to Cart:** The attacker must be able to access and interact with their cart on the mobile management store.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided image link is not accessible as it requires authentication. However, the description indicates the screenshot proves a negative value can be used to manipulate the price.
