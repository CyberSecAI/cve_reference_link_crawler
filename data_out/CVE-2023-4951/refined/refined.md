- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the pagination function of the "Client-based Authentication Policy Configuration" screen within the GreenRADIUS web admin interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access the affected page. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Phishing attacks
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Unauthorized actions within the application
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the manipulation of the pagination function in the "Client-based Authentication Policy Configuration" screen. The attacker crafts a malicious input that includes JavaScript which is not properly sanitized by the application and is then rendered in the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable GreenRADIUS web interface, specifically the pagination feature in the client-based authentication policy configuration page. They need to be capable of crafting malicious input that can trigger the XSS vulnerability.
