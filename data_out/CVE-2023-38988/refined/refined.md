- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The issue stems from the `delete` method in the `OaNotifyController` class within the `com.thinkgem.jeesite.modules.oa.web` package. This method allows any authenticated user to delete notifications, regardless of who created them, which includes notifications created by administrators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access control/authorization. The `delete` method lacks proper checks to verify if a user has the right to delete a particular notification, leading to unauthorized deletion of data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A regular user can delete notifications created by administrators, potentially leading to information loss, disruption of notifications, and impacting communication within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: By logging in as a regular user and utilizing the vulnerable `delete` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system.
