{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper verification of the sender's identity when processing signed peer records. Specifically, while the signature on the peer record is checked for validity, the peer ID of the signer is not compared to the peer ID of the connection over which the record was received.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of signed peer records. A node accepts a signed peer record as long as the signature is valid, without ensuring the record actually originates from the expected peer.",
       "The peer store lacks the logic to garbage collect or remove the stored data associated with these unverified, and potentially malicious, peer records.",
      "The cleanup mechanism in the peer store only works when a peer disconnects, which does not occur when a node receives records from unconnected, malicious peers"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability to store an arbitrary amount of data in a remote node's memory by sending signed peer records with valid signatures but from unexpected peer IDs. Since this data is not garbage collected, the victim node can run out of memory, leading to a crash (Denial of Service). The attack can be performed over time.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends signed peer records with valid signatures to a vulnerable go-libp2p node over the network.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to establish network communication with the target node and craft validly signed peer records. The attacker does not require any prior knowledge or privileges on the target system."
