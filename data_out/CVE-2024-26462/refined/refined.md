Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) version 1.21.2, specifically in the `ndr.c` file within the KDC (Key Distribution Center) component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The code allocates memory using `malloc` within the `k5_buf_init_dynamic` function. However, if a specific condition in an if-statement evaluates to true after the call to `k5_buf_init_dynamic`, the allocated memory is not freed before the program returns which leads to memory leak. This is a resource exhaustion issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated exploitation of the memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, ultimately causing a denial-of-service condition. The KDC may become unresponsive or crash due to memory starvation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path in the Kerberos KDC, leading to the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the KDC which will trigger the vulnerable code path. 
- No specific privileges are mentioned as needed.
- The attacker can be remote, since the vulnerable Kerberos KDC component is network facing.

**Additional Details (from GitHub content):**
- The vulnerability is located at line 103 of `/krb5/src/kdc/ndr.c` in MIT Kerberos 5 version 1.21.2.
- The memory allocation happens at line 128 within the `k5_buf_init_dynamic` function.
- The memory leak occurs if the if statement at line 102 evaluates to true and results in the program returning on line 103 without freeing memory.
- The Github content details the code flow.
- The Github content provides download address for vulnerable version of krb5.
