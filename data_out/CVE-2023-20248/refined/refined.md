- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting malicious data in a specific data field in the interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and remote, with the ability to insert malicious data into a specific field. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R).
