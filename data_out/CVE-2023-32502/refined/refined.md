- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pro Mime Types WordPress plugin, in versions 1.0.7 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that performs an action on the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to unknowingly submit a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
