Is assert better than throw?

AFAIK, this is the only case that an exception could be thrown explicitly.

And this case occurs rarely, so I replace it with assert.

This patch can also remove try-catch statement in parsing method

If the code is valid, this should be dead code, isn''t it?

If the wasm code is valid, this assert would be useless as you mentioned.

But this assert is newly added for invalid wasm code.

Since we generate bytecodes one by one during the parsing of wasm code, invalid wasm instructions might trigger incorrect behavior like pop of empty vmStack. So, I added this assert to simply check the invalid case as we basically assume that Walrus handles only valid wasm codes.
