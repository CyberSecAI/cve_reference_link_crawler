- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high-privilege user, such as an administrator, can inject malicious scripts that will execute when other users interact with the plugin's settings or when a job submission is previewed, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on the website, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By injecting malicious scripts into the "Field Name" setting when adding or editing custom fields.
    - By injecting malicious scripts into the "OutPut" field when editing a custom field, which is then displayed during job submission previews.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) on the WordPress site.
