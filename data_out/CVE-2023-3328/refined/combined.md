## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Custom Field For WP Job Manager < 1.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

To test, you also need to have WP Job Manager installed.
When adding a new field:
1. In the plugin settings, "Add a New Field" and for the "Field Name" use `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` and save.
2. Edit the field you created and see the XSS.
When editing an existing field:
1. Edit a field
2. For the "Field Name" use `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` and in the "OutPut" field enter `<script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Add a new job and go through the submission process. When previewing, the plugin does not sanitize the "OutPut" string, leading to an XSS.
