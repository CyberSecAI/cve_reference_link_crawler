{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A bonding device's type is changed when a non-ARPHRD_ETHER member is added, but associated devices (like lapbether) are not properly notified and closed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of device type changes in bonding drivers",
      "Lack of proper cleanup for dependent network devices upon bonding device type changes",
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to inconsistent state between devices"
    ],
    "impact": "A kernel panic (skb_under_panic) due to a use-after-free, causing denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Create a bonding device without members.",
      "Create a lapbether device on the bonding device.",
       "Add a non-ARPHRD_ETHER member to the bonding device to force a change of type"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to create network devices and manage bonding interfaces."
