# Double free in shdr\_verify\_signature

High

[jbech-linaro](/jbech-linaro)

GHSA-jrw7-63cq-7vhm
Sep 13, 2023

## Package

OP-TEE

## Affected versions

>=3.20

## Patched versions

3.22 and later

## Description

Amazon security, the Trusted Software Security Team have found a double free taking place in the `shdr_verify_signature()` function. The attack involves three different sessions where the heap can be controlled to some extent making it possible to load a corrupt/modified TA. Even though this is a complex attack, Amazon was able to create a proof of concept to carry out a successful attack that compromised and gained control over the entire secure world. When initially reported there was no proof of concept and we gave it "low severity". But once we got notified about the working proof of concept agreed to increase the severity, with the CSVV score: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N` which translates to `"7.4 / high severity"`.

This issue is present in OP-TEE 3.20 and later. Earlier versions than that are not affected by this issue. The fix was merged before the release of OP-TEE 3.22 July 7th. So, OP-TEE 3.22 and later has been patched.

#### Trigger the problem

On the vulnerable version, `shdr_verify_signature()` can end up doing a double free. `shdr_verify_signature()` is used to verify a Trusted Application binary before it is loaded. To verify the signature of a TA, OP-TEE have to allocate a memory for RSA key. The function responsible for the allocation is `sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key()`, which will try to allocate this memory from the OP-TEE heap.

A RSA key consist of an exponent and a modulus (represented as the variables `e` and `n`). In OP-TEE, the allocation for the exponent and the modulus is not an atomic operation and therefore it might succeed allocating one of them, but failing to allocate the other one. For example, the allocation of `e` might succeed, but `n` might fail. When that happens, the function `sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key()` will free `e` and return with an error code, but variable `e` will remain on an address that already has been freed once . As a consequence, the `shdr_verify_signature()` function will free it again. In short, what we have is a "double free" bug.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
