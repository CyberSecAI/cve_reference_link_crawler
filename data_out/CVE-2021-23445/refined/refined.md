{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The HTML escape entities function in datatables.net did not properly escape the contents of arrays, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a web application, potentially leading to stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, exposing sensitive information, accessing privileged services, or delivering malware.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker can provide an array containing malicious script to the vulnerable function, which renders the script without escaping it."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject data into the application that is then passed to the vulnerable function. This could be through user input, data manipulation, or other means.",
   "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs specifically when an array is passed to the HTML escape entities function. The function doesn't properly escape the content of the array before rendering it. The fix involves joining the array into a comma separated string and then escaping this string."
