Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-3596:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how `rsync` is used in OpenStack's undercloud. Specifically, `rsync` stores sensitive Swift data (including administrative credentials for the overcloud) in a way that makes it visible to local users of the undercloud.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Leak: Sensitive data, such as administrator credentials, is exposed to local users of the undercloud due to how rsync manages the data.
- Lack of access control:  Local users on the undercloud can access sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: Attackers with network access to the undercloud can gain access to the exposed sensitive information.
- Compromised private information:  The leaked credentials could lead to the compromise of private information.
- Potential for further compromise:  Successful exploitation could lead to full access to the rest of the OpenStack deployment, as the leaked credentials provide access to the overcloud.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network Access: Attackers need network access to the undercloud.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the undercloud.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability once the attacker is on the undercloud network.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens) for RHEL 7.6 EUS.
- The fix was delivered via RHSA-2022:8897.
- The bug report indicates that this is a high severity issue.
