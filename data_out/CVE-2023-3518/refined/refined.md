- **Root cause of vulnerability:** JWT authentication for service mesh in Consul incorrectly allows or denies access regardless of the service identities (mTLS certificate)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect JWT validation configuration. When multiple source intentions restrict access with differing JWT providers, only one JWT validation configuration is used. This allows some service identities to be allowed with mismatching JWTs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A service with a mismatched JWT could potentially gain unauthorized access to endpoints within the mesh, bypassing intended access restrictions.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting how JWT authentication is handled within the service mesh, a malicious service could leverage a mismatched JWT provider and gain access to resources that should be restricted based on its identity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to configure service intentions with mismatched JWT providers and have a service that can present a JWT.
