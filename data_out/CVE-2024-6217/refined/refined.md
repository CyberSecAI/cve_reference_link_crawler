Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `user-router.php` file of the SourceCodester Food Ordering Management System version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `1_verified` parameter within the `user-router.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, it's a time-based blind SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Dump:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract the full database contents using crafted payloads or tools like sqlmap. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data, system configurations, and other critical information stored in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP request parameter manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the vulnerable `1_verified` parameter through an HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. The specific position or role needed is not mentioned, but the attacker must be able to access the vulnerable `user-router.php` script and manipulate the `1_verified` parameter.
