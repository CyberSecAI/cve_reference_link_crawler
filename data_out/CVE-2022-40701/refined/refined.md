- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `delfile.cgi` script in the Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD router does not sanitize the `_filename` parameter before using it in a `system` call with `rm -rf`, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22). The lack of input sanitization of the filename parameter in `delfile.cgi` allows an attacker to specify arbitrary paths for deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the filesystem of the router, potentially leading to denial of service or other system-level impacts. The provided example demonstrates deleting `/etc/passwd`, which would prohibit access with SSH.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/delfile.cgi` with a malicious `_filename` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. They also require valid basic authentication credentials.
