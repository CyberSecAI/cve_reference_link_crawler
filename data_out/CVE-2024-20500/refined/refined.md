Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-20500:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient resource management when establishing TLS/SSL sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability stems from inadequate handling of resources during the establishment of TLS/SSL sessions within the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server on Cisco Meraki MX and Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit allows an attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to stop accepting new connections.
*   This results in the prevention of new SSL VPN connections from being established.
*   Existing SSL VPN sessions remain unaffected.
*   The AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully after the attack traffic ceases without requiring manual intervention.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attack vector involves sending a series of crafted TLS/SSL messages to the vulnerable VPN server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
*   The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted TLS/SSL messages.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to devices that have the Cisco AnyConnect VPN service enabled.
*   Devices using only L2TP/IPsec are not vulnerable.
*   The severity is rated as Medium with a CVSS base score of 5.8.
*   Cisco Meraki has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds other than disabling AnyConnect VPN to mitigate the risk.
