- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the parsing of XE files due to a lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uninitialized memory usage during XE file parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious XE file or directing the user to a malicious page that triggers the parsing of such file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious XE file or visit a malicious page containing it. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
