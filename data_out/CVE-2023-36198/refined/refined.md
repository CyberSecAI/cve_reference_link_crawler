The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the `sgxwallet` project: a NULL pointer dereference and a heap out-of-bounds (OOB) write.

**1. NULL Pointer Dereference:**

*   **Root Cause:** The global variable `curve` can be NULL if the function `trustedGenerateEcdsaKey` is called before `trustedEnclaveInit`.
*   **Weakness:** A null pointer dereference occurs when `trustedGenerateEcdsaKey` tries to use `curve` without proper initialization.
*  **Impact:** The application could crash if the vulnerable code path is triggered.
*   **Attack Vector:** Calling `trustedGenerateEcdsaKey` before `trustedEnclaveInit`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to invoke the `trustedGenerateEcdsaKey` function before calling the `trustedEnclaveInit` function, which might require access to internal APIs of the SGX enclave.

**2. Heap OOB Write:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `CHECK_STATUS` macro uses a buffer `errString` of size `BUF_LEN` (1024 bytes), while the allocated buffer `_in_err_string` for error messages from the EDL definition is only 256 bytes. The `snprintf` in the `CHECK_STATUS` macro might write beyond the allocated buffer when the error message is longer than 256 bytes.
*   **Weakness:** Buffer overflow vulnerability due to a mismatch in buffer sizes between the allocated buffer and where the error message is formatted.
*   **Impact:** This heap-based buffer overflow can potentially lead to a crash, memory corruption, or potentially other undefined behavior. This could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the content of error messages.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering an error within the `trustedBlsSignMessage` function that results in a message larger than 256 bytes being passed to the `CHECK_STATUS` macro.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to invoke the `trustedBlsSignMessage` function with parameters that will lead to an error, and additionally needs to have knowledge of the error message creation logic to craft an error which has length greater than 256 bytes. This requires knowledge of the application's internals and function parameters to trigger.
