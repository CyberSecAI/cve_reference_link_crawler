# ReDoS on endpoint html5client/useragent

High

[antobinary](/antobinary)
published
GHSA-rwrv-p665-4vwp
Jun 1, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.2, <2.3.19, <2.4.7, <2.5.0-beta.2

## Patched versions

2.3.19, 2.4.7, 2.5.0-beta.2

## Description

### Impact

By using specific a RegularExpression an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service.

The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). Attackers can abuse this to perform a denial of service by sending a specially-constructed regular expression which triggers excessive processing within the regular expression engine.

### Patches

Given the limited use of the `html5client/useragent` endpoint, we have opted to remove it from the code altogether. Its use for Legacy client checks has transitioned to using a different library months ago. BigBlueButton's documentation has been updated to point to a different online service to find one's user agent.

[Patch in BigBlueButton 2.3.19](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14896)

[Patch in BigBlueButton 2.4.7](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14886)

[Patch in BigBlueButton 2.5.0-beta.2](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14886)

### Workarounds

If you are not able to upgrade to a patched version, you can eliminate the attack surface by disabling NginX forwarding the requests to the handler. Add the following block to your NginX configuration.

```
location /html5client/useragent {
  return 404;
}

```

For BigBlueButton 2.3 or 2.4 a good place to add this block would be in `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/`

For BigBlueButton 2.5 a good place to add this block would be in `/usr/share/bigbluebutton/nginx/`

Reload via `sudo systemctl reload nginx`

Test this change by navigating to `<yourserver.com>/html5client/useragent` -- if you see 404, the workaround is active.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
