- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe use of `target="_blank"` in third-party links.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of `target="_blank"` without `rel="noopener"` or `rel="noreferrer"` can expose the linking page to potential `window.opener` attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can allow the attacker to potentially take control of the original page by manipulating the window.opener object, such as redirecting it to a malicious site or stealing information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to inject malicious javascript code via a third-party link opened with `target="_blank"` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control or manipulate content of a linked third party web site. The user needs to click on the malicious link.
