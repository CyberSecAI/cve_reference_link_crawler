Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.17.8 and 1.16.15, minor point releases.

These minor releases include a security fix following the security policy:

* regexp: stack exhaustion compiling deeply nested expressions

On 64-bit platforms, an extremely deeply nested expression can cause regexp.Compile to cause goroutine stack exhaustion, forcing the program to exit. Note this applies to very large expressions, on the order of 2MB.

Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this.

This is CVE-2022-24921 and <https://go.dev/issue/51112>.

View the release notes for more information:

    <https://go.dev/doc/devel/release.html#go1.17.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:

    <https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

"git checkout go1.17.8" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Carlos and Alex for the Go team
