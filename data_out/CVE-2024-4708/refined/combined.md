## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v4 9.3**
* **ATTENTION**: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor**: mySCADA
* **Equipment**: myPRO
* **Vulnerability**: Use of Hard-coded Password

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to remotely execute code on the affected device.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following mySCADA products are affected:

* myPRO: Versions prior to 8.31.0

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)

The affected application uses a hard-coded password which could allow an attacker to remotely execute code on the affected device.

[CVE-2024-4708](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-4708) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2024-4708](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-4708). A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Nassim Asrir working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

mySCADA recommends updating myPRO to [v8.31.0](https://www.myscada.org/mypro/).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).
