- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `add_white_node` function of the Tenda AC10U router firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `add_white_node` function reads a user-provided parameter without performing any length checks, leading to a stack overflow when the input exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of service (DoS): The overflow can crash the httpd process, resulting in a denial of service.
    - Remote code execution (RCE): An attacker can potentially craft an exploit to gain remote code execution by overwriting the stack with malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to the `/goform/InsertWhite` endpoint with a large string provided as the `domain` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs network access to the Tenda AC10U router.
    - No prior authentication is explicitly mentioned as required.
