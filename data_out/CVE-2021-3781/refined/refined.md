Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file access protection within Ghostscript when handling the "%pipe%" PostScript device. Specifically, the permission checking mechanism only validated the substring *after* the device specifier, instead of validating the entire file name string (including the device specifier itself). This oversight, combined with Ghostscript's need to create temporary files in standard directories like `/tmp`, enabled a bypass of the `-dSAFER` sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is that the file access permission check did not properly validate the full path string including the '%pipe%' specifier.
- **Sandbox Bypass:** The flawed validation allowed an attacker to bypass the `-dSAFER` sandbox intended to restrict file system access and other operations.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By using the `%pipe%` device with an arbitrary path, attackers could execute shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject a specially crafted PostScript document to execute arbitrary commands on the system, with the privileges of the Ghostscript interpreter.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation could lead to breaches of confidentiality, data integrity, and system availability due to the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
- **Privilege escalation:** While the most severe impacts were considered more likely when running Ghostscript as root, the vulnerability allows code execution with the privileges of the user running Ghostscript.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PostScript Documents:** Attackers could craft malicious PostScript documents that exploit the `%pipe%` device and insufficient input validation.
- **File Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered during file handling operations within Ghostscript when the `%pipe%` device is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide crafted PostScript:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PostScript document as input to the Ghostscript interpreter.
- **Target System:** The target system must have a vulnerable version of Ghostscript installed.
- **Operating System:** The exploit is restricted to Unix-like systems.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Ghostscript versions 9.50 up to 9.54 and also in the git version 9.55.
- A patch was created to include the device specifier string ("%pipe%") in the permissions checking to remediate the vulnerability.
- The fix was included in the official Ghostscript/GhostPDL 9.55.0 release.
- The vulnerability was considered trivial to exploit.
- The vulnerability was found by multiple researchers independently.
