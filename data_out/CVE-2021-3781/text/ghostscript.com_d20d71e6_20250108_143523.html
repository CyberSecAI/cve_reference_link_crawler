# SECURITY ADVISORY SEPTEMBER 9, 2021 - CVE-2021-3781

**Synopsis:** The file access protection built into Ghostscript proved insufficient for the
"%pipe%" PostScript device, when combined with Ghostscript's requirement to be able to create and
control temporary files in the conventional temporary file directories (for example, "/tmp" or "/temp).
This exploit is restricted to Unix-like systems (i.e., it doesn't affect Windows). The most severe
claimed results are only feasible if the exploit is run as a "high privilege" user (root/superuser
level) \u2013 a practice we would discourage under any circumstances.

**Resolution:** The solution involves including the device specifier string ("%pipe%") in the
permissions checking, meaning the entire file name string is validated, rather than (as before) only
the sub-string following the device specifier.

To remediate CVE-2021-3781 please apply the following patch: [Patch](https://marketing.artifex.com/e/912391/-gita-commitdiffh-a9bd3dec9fde/4p42h/73762904?h=ij8LZ1TXVhbQ19tmZFG_Hq8B6tjfLxEJ7Qo8tGe7EVs)

We are not issuing a patch release at this time, as this fix will be included with the official
