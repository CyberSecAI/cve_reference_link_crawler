Package        : modsecurity-apache
Version        : 2.9.3-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-48279 CVE-2023-24021
Debian Bug     : 1029329

Multiple issues were found in modsecurity-apache, open source, cross
platform web application firewall (WAF) engine for Apache which allows
remote attackers to bypass the applications firewall and other
unspecified impact.

CVE-2022-48279

    In ModSecurity before 2.9.6 and 3.x before 3.0.8, HTTP multipart
    requests were incorrectly parsed and could bypass the Web Application
    Firewall.
    NOTE: this is related to CVE-2022-39956 but can be considered
    independent changes to the ModSecurity(C language) codebase.

CVE-2023-24021

    Incorrect handling of null-bytes in file uploads in ModSecurity
    before 2.9.7 may allow for Web Application Firewall bypasses and
    buffer iverflows on the Web Application Firewall when executing
    rules reading the FILES_TMP_CONTENT collection.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.9.3-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your modsecurity-apache packages.
