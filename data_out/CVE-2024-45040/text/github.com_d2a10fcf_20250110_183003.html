### @Tabaie **[Tabaie](/Tabaie)** commented [Aug 13, 2024](#issue-2464092960)

This PR adds a random mask to the BSB22 commitments in order to make them hiding.

It is achieved simply by randomizing a new variable and adding it to the commitment.

| [@ivokub](https://github.com/ivokub) `TestNoCommitmentVariable` is failing because no commitment is truly empty anymore. Is that a desired feature or can we just remove the test?  I made the test to expect provers success instead. It can be useful in the future to catch regressions. I think it is useful that we can have prover assigned random commitment if we don't commit to anything. |

I think it makes all sense! I added a regression test also.
