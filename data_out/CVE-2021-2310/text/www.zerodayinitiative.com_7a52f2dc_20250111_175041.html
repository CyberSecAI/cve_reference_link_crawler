# Advisory Details

April 22nd, 2021
## Oracle VirtualBox NAT Heap-based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-456ZDI-CAN-13428

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-2310](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-2310) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.5, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | VirtualBox |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the implementation of NAT. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
