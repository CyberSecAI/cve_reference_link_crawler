Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49271:

**CVE-2023-49271**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `check_out_date` parameter from the GET request is directly embedded into the HTML document without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Input from the `check_out_date` parameter is not sanitized before being echoed back in the HTML response.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `check_out_date` parameter. When a user visits the crafted URL, the injected script will be executed in their browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the webpage.
    *   Stealing user credentials or sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted URL where the `check_out_date` parameter contains the malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it. The attacker does not require any prior authentication or specific position on the network.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability exists in the `reservation.php` file where the value of `check_out_date` parameter, obtained from the GET request, is directly reflected in the HTML within an input field:

```php
if (isset($_GET["check_in_date"])) {
 $check_in_date = $_GET["check_in_date"];
 $check_out_date = $_GET["check_out_date"];
 $no_children = $_GET["children"];
 $no_adults = $_GET["adults"];
}
...
<div class="form-group">
 <span class="form-label">Check out</span>
 <input class="form-control" name="check_out_date" id="check_out_date" type="text" required value="<?php if (isset($check_out_date)) {
echo $check_out_date;
} ?>"/>
</div>
```
