  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-20572",
      "root_cause": "The device-mapper framework allows marking targets as immutable, preventing table reloads that change the target type. The dm-verity target's feature flags lacked the DM_TARGET_IMMUTABLE flag, which could allow switching the verity target with a different target type.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing DM_TARGET_IMMUTABLE flag in dm-verity target feature flags"
      ],
      "impact": "Potential to bypass verity target immutability, which could allow for unexpected target type switches.",
       "attack_vectors": "Device-mapper framework manipulation.",
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to modify device-mapper tables."
