Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a missing authorization check in the AI Post Generator | AutoWriter WordPress plugin. Specifically, several AJAX actions within the plugin did not verify if the user had the necessary capabilities to perform the requested actions before executing them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Capability Checks:** The plugin's AJAX actions for retrieving posts, publishing posts, previewing posts, saving posts, and deleting posts lacked proper capability checks. This means that functions hooked by these AJAX actions could be accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin did not implement nonce verification on its AJAX requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker with minimal privileges (subscriber or higher) to:

- **View All Posts:** Access all posts generated by the plugin, even those in a non-published status.
- **Create New Posts:** Create new posts, and publish them without proper authorization.
- **Publish Unpublished Posts:** Publish posts that were previously unpublished or in draft status.
- **Delete Posts:** Delete posts without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is primarily network-based as the attacker sends AJAX requests to the WordPress site.
- **AJAX Actions:** The attacker sends malicious requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints within the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the WordPress site with subscriber-level access or higher.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable site.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided information includes details about the fix implemented in version 3.4 of the plugin. The fix involves adding capability checks using `current_user_can()` before executing AJAX actions. Also, the fix includes adding nonce verification. The changelog shows which functions are modified to add these security measures.

- The content also suggests that CVE-2024-32713 might be a duplicate of this issue.
