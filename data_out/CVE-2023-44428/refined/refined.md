- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer during the parsing of CAP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious CAP file. User interaction is required as the target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious CAP file.
