- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `htmlToPlainText` function in the Fabric Open Source project directly assigns untrusted HTML content to the `innerHTML` property of a temporary div element without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization before using `innerHTML`. Specifically, the `htmlToPlainText` function takes an HTML string as input and assigns it directly to `tempDiv.innerHTML` which can execute arbitrary JavaScript code if the html string contains malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information like cookies or authentication tokens.
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    - Manipulating the web page's content and behavior.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious HTML code containing JavaScript into the `html` variable passed to the vulnerable `htmlToPlainText` function. This would be done by manipulating the application to process malicious HTML through this function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the `html` input to the vulnerable function within the application. They would need some vector to inject malicious HTML that would be processed by this application.
