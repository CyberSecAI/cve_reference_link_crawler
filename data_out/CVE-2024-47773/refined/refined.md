{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the way Discourse handles caching for anonymous users and XHR requests, which allows for cache poisoning.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is an anonymous cache poisoning issue, where an attacker can manipulate the cache to serve responses without preloaded data by making multiple XHR requests.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can poison the cache, leading to anonymous users receiving a response without preloaded data. This impacts availability (though not total loss) and integrity as the data is not the intended state of the page.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed over the network using XHR requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs network access to make repeated XHR requests. No user interaction is required, and no privileges are needed."
