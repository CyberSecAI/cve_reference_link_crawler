{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `tcf_skbmod_dump()` function in the Linux kernel's networking subsystem copies data from the kernel stack to user space without properly initializing a structure, leading to a kernel information leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `struct tc_skbmod` has a four-byte hole that isn't initialized before being copied to user space via `tcf_skbmod_dump()`."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could potentially leak kernel stack memory contents.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `tcf_skbmod_dump()` function, which is exposed through the netlink interface and traffic control subsystem.",
      "Specific sequence of netlink messages to trigger `tcf_action_add` and `tc_ctl_action`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the netlink interface and traffic control subsystem. This usually requires local access or being part of a privileged container."
