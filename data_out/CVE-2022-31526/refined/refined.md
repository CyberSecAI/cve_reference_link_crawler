Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-31526 and other related CVEs:

**CVE-2022-31526 (and similar path traversal vulns)**

*   **Root Cause:** The core issue across all these CVEs is the unsafe use of the `Flask` `send_file` function within various GitHub repositories. The `send_file` function, when given untrusted or unsanitized input for the file path, allows attackers to perform absolute path traversal attacks.
    *   Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the fact that when `send_file` receives an absolute path, it will bypass any path restrictions and access files outside the intended directory. This allows attackers to request and download arbitrary files from the server's filesystem
    *  The root cause is also related to `os.path.join` call that is unsafe to use with untrusted input, When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CWE-22:** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
    *   Absolute path traversal vulnerability
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** High - Attackers can read arbitrary files from the server which may contain sensitive data, like application source code, credentials, configuration files, or system files.
    *   **Integrity:** None -  The attacker can read files but cannot modify them in general.
    *   **Availability:** Low - Can potentially cause resource exhaustion by accessing large files repeatedly.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network based exploitation by crafting malicious HTTP requests to download arbitrary files using path traversal.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No special privileges, user interaction is required.
    *   The attacker should be able to reach the vulnerable endpoint.

**CVSS v3 Metrics**

*   **Attack Vector (AV):** Network
*   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low
*   **Privileges Required (PR):** None
*   **User Interaction (UI):** None
*   **Scope (S):** Changed
*   **Confidentiality (C):** High
*   **Integrity (I):** None
*   **Availability (A):** Low

**Common Elements across the CVEs**
*   All the listed CVEs in this report relate to the same root cause, which is the unsafe use of `Flask`'s `send_file` function and related unsafe path handling.
*   The affected repositories seem to be hobby or personal projects and not widely used.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions a `github/securitylab#669` issue where the vulnerabilities were initially reported, and it seems like a tool called CodeQL from GitHub was used to identify these issues.
*   Some of the reports and CVEs were disputed because the affected projects were considered "pet projects", or did not have a valid license, vendor, package, or release.
*   The disclosure process was not coordinated as it was done publicly by directly opening issues and pull requests which is against the vulnerability reporting guidelines of the project.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple projects (around 100 based on the initial statement).
*   Many of the projects are older (2012-2021) and probably abandoned/unmaintained.

The content provides a lot more context than the general CVE description usually provides, detailing the specific cause of the vulnerabilities, the impact, and some discussion around how they were discovered and disclosed.
