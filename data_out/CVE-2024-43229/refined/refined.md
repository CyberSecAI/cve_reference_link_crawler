- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could potentially execute actions that should be reserved for higher privileged users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a function that lacks proper access control, allowing direct or indirect manipulation by unauthorized users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be at least a subscriber (lowest privileged role in WordPress) and be able to interact with the vulnerable function.
