Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as ‘trusted’ in order to be vulnerable. This vulnerability is independent of the one reported in CVE-2022-40764."

This can be achieved by social engineering or by uploading a malicious project to a public code repository." ,
          "additional_notes":"The vulnerability arises because Snyk CLI interprets part of the input as a shell command. The `snyk-go-parser` package modifies the 'ignore' value by splitting it into chunks based on space, pushing chunks as is, and with '/*' appended. This, when combined with `child_process.spawn`, can be exploited via techniques such as manipulating `IFS` to inject commands. The issue can be exploited by viewing untrusted files in a VSCode editor, due to VSCode extension automatically scanning projects. Snyk addressed this vulnerability and recommends users update to the latest version of the CLI."
