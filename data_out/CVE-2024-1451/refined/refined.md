- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-provided input for the "Pronunciation" and "Pronouns" fields in the user profile settings. Specifically, the `user.pronunciation` attribute is rendered using `html_safe` without prior sanitization, allowing arbitrary HTML injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is present because the user-controlled "Pronunciation" field's content is directly inserted into the HTML output without sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's profile page that will be executed when other users view it. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially including data theft, session hijacking, or further attacks. The report also mentions a CSP-bypass, which suggests the XSS can be used to circumvent the browser's content security policy.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the user profile settings page. A malicious user can craft a payload in the "Pronunciation" or "Pronouns" fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs an account on the platform and the ability to edit their user profile settings. They must fill the vulnerable fields with malicious HTML/JavaScript.
