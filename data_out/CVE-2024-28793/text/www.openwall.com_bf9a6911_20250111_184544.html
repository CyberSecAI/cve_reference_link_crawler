SECURITY-3250 / CVE-2024-28793
Team Concert Git Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier does not escape the Rational Team
Concert (RTC) server URI on the build page when showing changes.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs.

SECURITY-3278 / CVE-2024-4189 (LrScriptResultsParser.java) & CVE-2024-4184
(XpathReader.java) & CVE-2024-4690 (others)
OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.0 and earlier does not
configure its XML parsers to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for OpenText
Application Automation Tools Plugin build steps and post-build steps to
have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

SECURITY-3277 / CVE-2024-4211 (ALM jobs configurations) & CVE-2024-4691
(ALM Octane configurations) & CVE-2024-4692 (Service Virtualization
configurations)
OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.0 and earlier does not
perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate ALM jobs
configurations, ALM Octane configurations and Service Virtualization
configurations.

SECURITY-3070 / CVE-2024-5273
Report Info Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not perform path validation of the
workspace directory while serving report files.

Additionally, Report Info Plugin does not support distributed builds.

This results in a path traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers with
Item/Configure permission to retrieve Surefire failures, PMD violations,
Findbugs bugs, and Checkstyle errors on the controller file system by
editing the workspace path.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
