Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.

The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.1-beta
* Team Concert Git Plugin 2.0.5

Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following
plugins:

* Report Info Plugin

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:

SECURITY-3250 / CVE-2024-28793
Team Concert Git Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier does not escape the Rational Team
Concert (RTC) server URI on the build page when showing changes.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs.

SECURITY-3278 / CVE-2024-4189 (LrScriptResultsParser.java) & CVE-2024-4184
(XpathReader.java) & CVE-2024-4690 (others)
OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.0 and earlier does not
configure its XML parsers to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for OpenText
Application Automation Tools Plugin build steps and post-build steps to
have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

SECURITY-3277 / CVE-2024-4211 (ALM jobs configurations) & CVE-2024-4691
(ALM Octane configurations) & CVE-2024-4692 (Service Virtualization
configurations)
OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.0 and earlier does not
perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate ALM jobs
configurations, ALM Octane configurations and Service Virtualization
configurations.

SECURITY-3070 / CVE-2024-5273
Report Info Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not perform path validation of the
workspace directory while serving report files.

Additionally, Report Info Plugin does not support distributed builds.

This results in a path traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers with
Item/Configure permission to retrieve Surefire failures, PMD violations,
Findbugs bugs, and Checkstyle errors on the controller file system by
editing the workspace path.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
