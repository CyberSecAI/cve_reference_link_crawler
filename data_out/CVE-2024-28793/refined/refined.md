Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-28793

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Team Concert Git Plugin does not properly escape the Rational Team Concert (RTC) server URI when displaying changes on the build page. This lack of proper encoding allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability lies in the fact that the provided RTC server URI isn't sanitized before being rendered in the build page. This allows an attacker to inject and store malicious scripts in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers who can configure jobs can exploit this XSS vulnerability.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute malicious scripts within the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an attacker who is able to configure jobs within the Jenkins environment, and is able to insert a malicious RTC server URI.
- When a build is displayed, the injected script is executed in the browser of anyone viewing the build page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to configure jobs in the affected Jenkins instance. This could be achieved by having appropriate permissions within the system or by compromising an account that has those permissions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 2.0.4 and earlier of the Team Concert Git Plugin for Jenkins.
- The fix is available in version 2.0.5 of the Team Concert Git plugin.
- IBM Engineering Workflow Management (EWM) versions 7.0.2 and 7.0.3 are affected and require the fix from the Jenkins plugin.
