- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak password hashing method in `/etc/shadow` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently protected credentials. Specifically, the use of the `$1` hash in the shadow file indicates a weak hashing algorithm was used (likely MD5), making it easier to crack user passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker with system access can retrieve user passwords by exploiting the weak hashing method.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker requires local system access. They would need to access and read the `/etc/shadow` file on the affected system.
