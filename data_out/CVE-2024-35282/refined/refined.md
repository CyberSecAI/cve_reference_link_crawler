- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information (passwords) in memory, specifically within the iOS keychain.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper storage of sensitive data (CWE-316). The keychain stores passwords in unencrypted format.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to a jailbroken iOS device can dump the keychain and obtain cleartext passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to a jailbroken iOS device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable device and it must be jailbroken.
