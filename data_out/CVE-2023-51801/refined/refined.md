- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in `student_form.php` and `class_form.php`. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could also be leveraged for privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `student_form.php` and `class_form.php`, injecting malicious SQL payloads into the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and able to navigate to the "Student" or "Classes" pages and have the ability to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable scripts.
