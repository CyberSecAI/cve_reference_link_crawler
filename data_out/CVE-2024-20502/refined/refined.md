- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient resource management while establishing SSL VPN sessions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from inadequate resource management during SSL VPN session setup, specifically within the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to stop accepting new connections, thus preventing new SSL VPN connections from being established. Existing connections are not impacted and the server recovers after the attack ceases.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS requests to the VPN server of an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable VPN server. No authentication is required.
