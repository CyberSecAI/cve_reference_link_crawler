Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue in the WordPress Spiffy Calendar plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks:** The plugin lacks proper checks in a function, allowing unauthorized users to execute privileged actions.
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to enforce appropriate access restrictions, allowing users to perform actions they shouldn't be permitted to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user (specifically a Contributor) can execute actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies case-by-case.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by an attacker who exploits the lack of proper access control in the plugin.
*   The attacker must be a WordPress user with a Contributor role or higher, which is still a low-level privilege and easily obtained in many cases.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with the "Contributor" role or higher.
*   The attacker needs to target the vulnerable function within the plugin that does not have proper access controls.
