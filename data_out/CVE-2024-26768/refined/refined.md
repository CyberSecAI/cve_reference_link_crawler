Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-26768**.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an array overflow in the `acpi_core_pic` array within the Linux kernel's ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) implementation for LoongArch architecture. The array was previously sized based on `NR_CPUS` (the maximum number of logical CPUs), which could be smaller than the actual number of physical cores reported in the MADT (Multiple APIC Description Table). When parsing the MADT, if the number of physical cores exceeds `NR_CPUS`, the code could write beyond the bounds of the `acpi_core_pic` array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Array overflow:** The `acpi_core_pic` array was defined with a size based on the maximum logical CPUs (NR_CPUS) instead of the maximum physical CPUs reported in MADT table (MAX_CORE_PIC), leading to a potential buffer overflow when parsing the MADT.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:** The array overflow results in memory corruption that leads to a kernel crash. The provided crash log indicates a "kernel paging request" error, followed by an "Oops" message, which is a clear indicator of kernel-level memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- **System with large number of physical CPUs:** The vulnerability can be triggered on systems with a number of physical cores exceeding the configured NR_CPUS value which defaults to 64. An attacker does not directly trigger the bug but would rely on the system having this specific hardware configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities are needed other than triggering a kernel boot on a system that has more physical cores than logical cores configured in kernel. The system must have a MADT that declares more CPUs than NR_CPUS. The attacker does not directly cause the overflow through malicious input.
