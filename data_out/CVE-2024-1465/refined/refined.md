Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1465

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'carousel_skin' attribute of the Posts Carousel widget in the Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `carousel_skin` attribute before rendering it in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the database and executed when a user visits the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when they visit a page containing the vulnerable widget.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive information, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other harmful actions.
- **Website Defacement:** XSS can be used to modify content on the page, leading to potential website defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is within the Elementor Addons by Livemesh WordPress plugin.
- **Posts Carousel Widget:** The specific attack vector is through the `carousel_skin` attribute of the Posts Carousel widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access within the WordPress site. This allows them to edit content and inject the malicious script through the vulnerable widget.
