### @matetokodi **[matetokodi](/matetokodi)** commented [Mar 7, 2024](#issue-2173524321)

This fixes [#5101](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/issues/5101)

In rare cases the proxy object could get used after being incorrectly removed by the gc

Add stack checks to the start of all function calls

A Regression test is not included because I was unable to reproduce the crash with code that would be readable / easy to understand, only with a marginally simplified version of the example code given in the original issue, and [@zherczeg](https://github.com/zherczeg) advised against including it:

```
async function f0() {
    function f6() {
        return f0;
    }
    var proxy_handler = {
        "get": f0,
    };

    f0.__proto__ = new Proxy(f6, proxy_handler);
    var v12 = f0();
    return f0;
}
f0();
```

However I can include it anyways if requested.

Sorry, something went wrong.

The code changes look good to me, but I do think that the issue-reproducing test case should be included in the commit / test suite. A regression test does not have to be nice or easy-to-understand (it should be minimal though). Its purpose is to avoid the problem creeping back into the code base. (BTW, the test case is not big at all.)
