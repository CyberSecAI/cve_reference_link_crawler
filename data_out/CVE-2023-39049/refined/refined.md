Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of secret in youmart-tokunaga

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The 'youmart-tokunaga' mini-app on Line exposes its client secret within the response of a specific API request. This secret should be kept confidential.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hardcoded/Exposed Secret:** The client secret, a critical credential for authentication and authorization, is directly included in the API response sent to the client. This constitutes a major security flaw.
- **Lack of Secret Management:** The application lacks proper secret management practices by embedding a sensitive secret in a client-accessible response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Channel Access Token Acquisition:** An attacker can use the exposed client secret to obtain a channel access token, which is used to secure communications within the Line platform.
- **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** With a valid channel access token, an attacker can send malicious broadcast messages to all users of the 'youmart-tokunaga' mini-app. This could include phishing links, fraudulent information, or other harmful content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Traffic Interception:** An attacker can intercept the network traffic when a user opens the 'youmart-tokunaga' mini-app in Line.
- **Client-Side Inspection:** An attacker can inspect the response to the request `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry` through browser developer tools or other debugging tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Minimal:** The attacker needs minimal capabilities. They only need to have Line installed and open the 'youmart-tokunaga' mini-app.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to intercept the API request or to access the exposed secret through client-side inspection

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Line version 13.6.1.
- The exposed secret is used to obtain a channel access token, which is responsible for securing the communication channel within Line.
