Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a "Broken Access Control" issue. This generally means that the plugin is missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized actions. The plugin fails to properly verify if a user is authorized to perform certain actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is described as "low severity" and "unlikely to be exploited." However, a successful exploit could allow an attacker to perform actions they shouldn't be able to, which could potentially modify or delete data, or perform other unauthorized actions within the plugin's scope.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector would involve an attacker exploiting the missing access control check in a specific function. The specifics of the vulnerable function aren't detailed here.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be at least a subscriber level, indicating a logged-in user is required. They don't require any higher privileges on the system, like admin.

**Additional Details:**
* The affected plugin is "Reviews Plus" with versions <= 1.3.4 being vulnerable.
* The fix was released in version 1.3.5
* The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.
* The vulnerability was reported by Dhabaleshwar Das.

This information aligns with the general description of a broken access control vulnerability. However, the specifics of the exploited function are not mentioned.
