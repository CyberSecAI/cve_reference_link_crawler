Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of a JSON Web Token (JWT), which acts as a session token, directly in the URL when accessing the `/files` page. This exposes the token to various logging mechanisms, making it vulnerable to interception.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of session tokens in URLs: The primary weakness is passing the JWT via GET request parameters, which are logged in various places.
- Potential for session hijacking:  An attacker obtaining a valid JWT can impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: An attacker who obtains the session token can hijack the user's session.
- Sensitive information exposure: Attackers can gain access to sensitive information.
- Unauthorised actions: Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user.

**Attack vectors:**
- URL logging: URLs are frequently logged in web server logs, browser history, and other locations. An attacker gaining access to these logs can extract the session token from the logged URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to logs containing URLs:  An attacker needs access to locations where URLs are logged (web server logs, browser history, etc.).
- No direct interaction with the vulnerable application is needed to obtain the token.

**Additional details:**
- The affected versions are `<=10.10.0`.
- The patched version is `10.10.0`.
- No workarounds are available.
- The severity is rated as Low.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 2.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
- The associated CWE is CWE-598 (Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request).
