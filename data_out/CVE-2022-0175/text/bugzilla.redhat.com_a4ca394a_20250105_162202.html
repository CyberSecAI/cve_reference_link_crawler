| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2039003#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2022-01-10 17:52:24 UTC  ``` The virgl forgets to initialize the memory pointed by the res->ptr when it creates resource. And the memory can be mapped to the guest kernel when the VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING is issued. However, the guest userspace can read the data in the unintialized host memory by mmaping it from the guest kernel.
