# Stored XSS in excalidraw's web embed component

Moderate

[dwelle](/dwelle)
published
GHSA-m64q-4jqh-f72f
Apr 17, 2024

## Package

npm

@excalidraw/excalidraw
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=0.16.0 <0.17.6

## Patched versions

0.17.6, 0.16.4

## Description

### Summary

A stored XSS vulnerability in Excalidraw's web embeddable component. This allows arbitrary JavaScript to be run in the context of the domain where the editor is hosted.

### Poc

Inserting an embed with the below url (can be copy/pasted onto canvas to insert as embed) will log `42` to the console:

```
https://gist.github.com/vv=v<script>console.log(42)</script>

```
### Details

There were two vectors. One rendering untrusted string as iframe's `srcdoc` without properly sanitizing against HTML injection. Second by improperly sanitizing against attribute HTML injection. This in conjunction with allowing `allow-same-origin` sandbox flag (necessary for several embeds) resulted in the XSS.

Former was fixed by no longer rendering unsafe `srcdoc` content verbatim, and instead strictly parsing the supplied content and constructing the `srcdoc` manually. The latter by sanitizing properly.

The `allow-same-origin` flag is now also set only in cases that require it, following the principle of least privilege.

### Impact

This is a cross site scripting vulnerability, for more information, please see: <https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting>

Two npm `@excalidraw/excalidraw` stable version releases were affected (`0.16.x`, `0.17.x`), and both are now patched.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-32472

### Weaknesses

[CWE-80](/advisories?query=cwe%3A80)
