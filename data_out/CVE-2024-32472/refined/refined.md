Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-32472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two issues in how Excalidraw's web embed component handled user-provided URLs:

1.  **Unsanitized `srcdoc` Content:** The application was rendering untrusted strings directly as the `srcdoc` attribute of iframes without proper sanitization, allowing for HTML injection.
2.  **Improper Attribute Sanitization:** The application was not properly sanitizing against HTML injection in attributes.

These issues, when combined with the use of the `allow-same-origin` sandbox flag (required for certain embeds), created a path for cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning malicious scripts can be permanently embedded within the application through crafted URLs.
*   **HTML Injection:** The application was vulnerable to HTML injection due to the lack of sanitization of both the `srcdoc` attribute and general attributes.
*   **Insecure Iframe Configuration:** The `allow-same-origin` sandbox flag, while necessary for some legitimate embeds, was being applied more broadly than necessary, which exacerbated the XSS risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the domain where the Excalidraw editor was hosted.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could steal sensitive user data, such as session cookies, authentication tokens, or other private information.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying data or making API calls.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance of the application.
*   **Redirection:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs, which, when embedded into Excalidraw's web embed component, inject malicious JavaScript. The proof of concept (PoC) URL provided in the security advisory demonstrates this attack vector.
*   **Embedding malicious content**: An attacker can insert a crafted URL into an excalidraw diagram. This URL is then processed to create an embeddable component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to embed content:** An attacker needs the ability to insert or embed content into an Excalidraw drawing through the embed feature. This could be as simple as copy pasting an URL onto the canvas.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** An attacker needs knowledge of how the application handles embed URLs and the vulnerability within the parsing and rendering of the `srcdoc` attribute.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by:

1.  **Proper Sanitization:**  Instead of rendering the `srcdoc` content verbatim, the application now strictly parses it and constructs the `srcdoc` manually, preventing HTML injection in `srcdoc`. The attribute injection has also been fixed through sanitization.
2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** The `allow-same-origin` flag is now set only when it is absolutely required, reducing the attack surface by restricting access to other domain resources

**Additional notes**

*   The provided commit diffs show the changes made to fix the vulnerability. The changes involve modifying the `getEmbedLink` function in `src/element/embeddable.ts` to include `sandbox: { allowSameOrigin }` in the returned object which is used to render the iframe, and changing the logic used to evaluate `allowSameOrigin`.
* The advisory mentions that two versions were affected (`0.16.x` and `0.17.x`) and that two new versions were released to address the issue (`0.17.6` and `0.16.4`).
