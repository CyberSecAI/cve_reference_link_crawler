- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mediavine Control Panel plugin for WordPress versions 2.10.2 and earlier lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, which then makes a request to the vulnerable WordPress site while the user is authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into triggering it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
