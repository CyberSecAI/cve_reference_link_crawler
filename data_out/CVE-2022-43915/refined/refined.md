- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the IBM App Connect Enterprise Certified Container operands do not limit the use of the `unshare` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation vulnerability due to the unrestricted `unshare` command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges within the containerized environment.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the unrestricted use of the `unshare` command within the App Connect Enterprise Certified Container environment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have some level of access to the containerized environment where the `unshare` command is accessible and can be leveraged to gain elevated privileges.
