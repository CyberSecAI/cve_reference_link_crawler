Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a recursion introduced when disconnecting idle connections upon deletion of a cluster via the Cluster Discovery Service (CDS). When a cluster is removed, all associated idle connections are closed. The process of closing these connections could recursively call itself, leading to stack exhaustion if a large number of idle connections existed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Recursion:** The primary vulnerability is the recursive nature of the idle connection closing process when a cluster is deleted. This recursion wasn't properly limited and could lead to stack overflow.
- **Lack of Stack Overflow Protection:** The code didn't implement measures to avoid stack overflow when closing a large number of idle connections during cluster deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The vulnerability leads to a crash of the Envoy process due to stack exhaustion.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By triggering the recursive connection closing process, an attacker can cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be initiated remotely.
- **CDS Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate the CDS to delete a cluster with a large number of idle connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** An attacker needs high privileges to manipulate the CDS configuration and cause a cluster deletion.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to communicate with the CDS server and Envoy.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** Envoy versions 1.20.0 and newer were affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability was fixed in versions 1.20.2 and 1.21.1.
- **Workaround:** Reducing the maximum number of connections in the cluster circuit breaker can mitigate the issue. It's noted that an 8MB stack can handle disconnecting less than 2000 connections.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.4, with the vector string of  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
