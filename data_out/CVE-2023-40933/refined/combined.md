## Nagios Success Stories

We’ve worked with thousands of incredible businesses of all sizes across the globe. Hear what they have to say.

[View Case Studies](https://www.nagios.com/case-studies/)

We are a telecommunications company and the leader in our region. Our monitoring goals were fulfilled with Nagios. We had all of our devices monitored 24/7 and were able to take advantage of all the reports and tools that Nagios has to offer.

![comteco](https://www.nagios.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/comteco.webp)

The biggest advantage of Nagios for us is its customizations. Nagios has simplified a very large job, allowed us to make the necessary customizations needed and provided us with a community that is a valuable resource when a new requirement comes up.

Before monitoring, we couldn’t even spend the bulk of our time fighting fires; we were spending time finding them. Now, our system is nearly self-healing. Nagios is super easy to install and configure, runs on standard bash scripts, and allows us to automate anything.

# Nagios XI vulnerabilities resulting in privilege escalation (& more)

[Research & Threat Intel](https://outpost24.com/blog/category/research-and-threat-intel/)
Last updated: 20 Aug 2024

Written By
[Astrid Tedenbrant](https://outpost24.com/blog/authors/astrid-tedenbrant/)
Vulnerability Research Engineer, Outpost24

During some standard research as part of the Outpost24 Ghost Labs Vulnerability Research department, I discovered four different vulnerabilities in Nagios XI (version 5.11.1 and lower). Three of these vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-40931, CVE-2023-40933 and CVE-2023-40934) allow users, with various levels of privileges, to access database fields via SQL Injections. The data obtained from these vulnerabilities may be used to further escalate privileges in the product and obtain sensitive user data such as password hashes and API tokens.

The fourth vulnerability (CVE-2023-40932) allows [Cross-Site Scripting](https://outpost24.com/blog/cross-site-scripting-attacks-how-protect-against/) via the Custom Logo component, which will render on every page, including the login page. This may be used to read and modify page data, such as plain-text passwords from login forms.

All these vulnerabilities have been resolved as of 2023.09.11 and users are advised to upgrade to 5.11.2 or later.

## What is Nagios XI

Nagios XI is a popular and widely used commercial monitoring solution for IT infrastructure and network monitoring. It is the commercial version of the open-source Nagios Core monitoring platform, and provides added features to simplify the process of managing complex IT environments.

Due to the access required by Nagios XI, it is often deployed in high-privileged environments, which makes it an interesting asset for an attacker to target.

## The four vulnerabilities

### 1. SQL Injection in Banner acknowledging endpoint (CVE-2023-40931)

Nagios XI features “Announcement Banners”, which can optionally be acknowledged by users. The endpoint for this feature is vulnerable to a SQL Injection attack.

When a user acknowledges a banner, a POST request is sent to `/nagiosxi/admin/banner\_message-ajaxhelper.php` with the POST data consisting of the intended action and message ID – `action=acknowledge banner message&id=3`.

The ID parameter is assumed to be trusted but comes directly from the client without sanitization. This leads to a SQL Injection where an authenticated user with low or no privileges can retrieve sensitive data, such as from the `xi\_session` and `xi\_users` table containing data such as emails, usernames, hashed passwords, API tokens, and backend tickets.

This vulnerability does not require the existence of a valid announcement banner ID, meaning it can be exploited by an attacker at any time.

### 2. SQL Injection in Host/Service Escalation in CCM (CVE-2023-40934)

The Core Configuration Manager in Nagios XI allows an authenticated user with privilege to manage host escalations to perform arbitrary database queries through the `/nagiosxi/includes/components/ccm/index.php` endpoint.

The parameters `tfFirstNotif`, `tfLastNotif`, and `tfNotifInterval` are assumed to be trusted despite coming directly from the client through a POST request.

This vulnerability results in the same access to the database as the other SQL Injection vulnerabilities, but requires additional privileges compared to CVE-2023-40931.

### 3. SQL Injection in Announcement Banner Settings (CVE-2023-40933)

Nagios XI has an administrative page for Announcement Banner settings, which contains a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/nagiosxi/admin/banner message-ajaxhelper.php` endpoint.

When performing the `update\_banner\_message\_settings` action on the affected endpoint, the `id` parameter is assumed to be trusted and is concatenated into a database query with no sanitization. This allows an attacker to modify the query.

Successful exploitation grants the same database access as the other two SQL Injection Vulnerabilities, but requires additional privileges compared to CVE-2023-40931.

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting in Custom Logo Component (CVE-2023-40932)

Nagios XI can be customized with a custom company logo, which will be displayed across the entire product. This includes the landing page, various administrative pages, and the login page.

Due to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in this feature, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript which will evaluate in any users’ browser. This can be used to read and modify page data, as well as perform actions on behalf on the affected user. Furthermore, as this renders on the login page, plain-text credentials can be stolen from users’ browsers as they enter them.

## Disclosure timeline

We found and disclosed the vulnerabilities to Nagios in August 2023. Here’s what happened next:

* 2023-08-04 – Contacted vendor and submitted report
* 2023-08-04 – Vendor acknowledged report, started reviewing
* 2023-08-11 – Vendor confirmed all 4 vulnerabilities
* 2023-08-11 – Contacted MITRE for CVE allocation
* 2023-09-01 – CVEs reserved by MITRE
* 2923-09-07 – Coordinated disclosure for 2023-09-19
* 2023-09-11 – Nagios XI 5.11.2 released with security fixes applied
* 2023-09-19 – Vulnerabilities fully disclosed

## The importance of application security testing

In a targeted attack, these types of vulnerabilities are relatively easy to exploit. As recent attacks have demonstrated (most notably the SolarWinds hack), IT management platforms are also likely targets. Without continuous application security testing in place, critical business data is at risk.
