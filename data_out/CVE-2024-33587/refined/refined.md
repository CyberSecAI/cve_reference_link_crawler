- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, specifically a missing authorization check.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated user can execute actions that are intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the function being exploited.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a function within the plugin that lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
