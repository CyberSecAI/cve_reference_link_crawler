Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36119:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `user:register_form` tag in Statamic CMS was not properly sanitizing or excluding the `password_confirmation` field during user registration. This resulted in the `password_confirmation` value being stored in plain text within the user's YAML file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Plaintext storage:** The primary vulnerability is storing the `password_confirmation` field in plaintext. While not the user's actual password, this confirmation value could potentially reveal information about the user's password or be used in attacks.
- **Data exposure:** This vulnerability exposed sensitive data (albeit indirectly) to any user with access to the user YAML files, typically developers of the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized users with access to the user YAML files could potentially view the `password_confirmation` value.
- **Limited direct impact:** The impact is limited because the `password_confirmation` is not the actual password, and the vulnerability is not directly exploitable by remote attackers, but rather via access to user files.
- **Potential for further attack:** Though not stated explicitly, this plaintext value could be used to potentially guess a user's password or leverage other types of credential-based attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** The attack vector is local to the server where the Statamic CMS application is hosted. An attacker needs access to the file system where user YAML files are stored.
- **Privileged access:** The attacker needs high privileges (typically developer-level access) to read user YAML files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **File system access:** The attacker needs read access to the file system of the Statamic CMS application.
- **Developer/Admin access:** The attacker typically requires developer or administrative access to the system.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Statamic CMS versions between 5.3.0 and 5.6.1.
- The patch for the vulnerability is included in version 5.6.2.
- The advisory recommends resetting passwords of affected users and clearing the stored `password_confirmation` values.
- If the user files are committed to a public git repo, the advisory also recommends clearing sensitive data from the git history using `git filter-repo`.
- The advisory also explains how to identify and fix the users affected.
