# Password confirmation stored in plain text via registration form

Low

[jasonvarga](/jasonvarga)
published
GHSA-qvpj-w7xj-r6w9
May 30, 2024

## Package

composer

statamic/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>=5.3.0 <5.6.2

## Patched versions

5.6.2

## Description

Users registering via the `user:register_form` tag will have their password confirmation stored in plain text in their user file.

### Impact

This only affects sites matching **all** of the following conditions:

* Running Statamic versions between 5.3.0 and 5.6.1. (This version range represents only one calendar week)
* Using the `user:register_form` tag.
* Using file-based user accounts. (Does not affect users stored in a database.)
* Has users that have registered during that time period. (Existing users are not affected.)

The password is only visible to users that have access to read user yaml files, typically developers of the application itself.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in 5.6.2, however any users registered during that time period and using the affected version range will still have the the `password_confirmation` value in their yaml files.

We recommend that affected users have their password reset. The following query can be entered into `php artisan tinker` and will output a list of affected emails:

```
Statamic\Facades\User::query()->whereNotNull('password_confirmation')->get()->map->email
```

The following can be entered into `tinker` and will clear both password\_confirmation as well as their existing password. They will be required to reset their password before their next login attempt.

```
Statamic\Facades\User::query()
  ->whereNotNull('password_confirmation')->get()
  ->each(fn ($user) => $user->remove('password_confirmation')->passwordHash(null)->save());
```
### References

If you are committing user files to a public git repo, you may consider clearing the sensitive data from the git history. You can use the following links for details.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
