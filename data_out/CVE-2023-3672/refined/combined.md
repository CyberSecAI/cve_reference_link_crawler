XSS mitigation

```
This change fixes a security issue raised by [@tyage](https://github.com/tyage) and reported by [@psmoros](https://github.com/psmoros),
in which the `p-name` property wasn't being properly entity-escaped, leading
to an XSS injection attack.

As part of this change I also improved the way that entities are being escaped.
