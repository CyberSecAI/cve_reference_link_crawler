Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries, specifically in versions up to 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8, and 15, and Java SE Embedded version 8u261.
*   The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed in the provided documents, only that it is one of several that were discovered in OpenJDK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is a vulnerability within the Java SE and Java SE Embedded software libraries.
*   The vulnerability is listed alongside other CVEs, indicating multiple issues were addressed in the same update.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized modification of data. Specifically, it could allow an attacker to make unauthorized changes by updating or inserting data.
*   It could also lead to unauthorized read access to some accessible data.
*   The NetApp advisory classifies the impact as potentially leading to the unauthorized ability to cause partial denial of service (partial DOS) .
*   The Debian Security Advisory mentions potential denial of service, information disclosure, and bypass of access/sandbox restrictions as general impacts resulting from multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2020-14797.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can be remote.
*   The attack complexity is high (AC:H), meaning it is not easy to exploit.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that no privileges are required (PR:N) and no user interaction is required (UI:N) for exploitation, however other sources mention user interaction may be required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker must be able to access the vulnerable Java SE or Java SE Embedded software remotely over a network.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need prior privileges or knowledge of the system beyond the existence of the vulnerability.
*   The high attack complexity suggests a degree of technical skill and knowledge of the vulnerability is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided documents indicate that multiple vendors (Debian, openSUSE, Gentoo, NetApp) were affected and released patches to mitigate the issue.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in openjdk-8 version 8u272-b10-0+deb9u1 (Debian), openjdk 8.272\_p10 (Gentoo), and Java 1.8.0.272 (openSUSE).
*   NetApp provides a comprehensive list of affected products.
*  The CVSS score is 3.7 (LOW) according to NetApp advisory
