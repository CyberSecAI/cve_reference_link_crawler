- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A permissions issue in the Passwords feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Password autofill may fill in passwords after failing authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Password autofill may fill in passwords after failing authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not explicitly stated but involves a user attempting to use the password autofill feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no special position or capabilities other than the ability to trigger password autofill functionality, after an authentication failure has occurred.
