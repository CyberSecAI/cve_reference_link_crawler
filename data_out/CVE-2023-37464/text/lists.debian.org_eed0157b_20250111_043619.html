Package        : cjose
Version        : 0.6.1+dfsg1-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-37464
Debian Bug     : 1041423

An incorrect Authentication Tag length usage was discovered in cjose, a
C library implementing the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption
(JOSE) standard, which could lead to integrity compromise.

The AES GCM decryption routine incorrectly uses the Tag length from the
actual Authentication Tag as provided in the JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
object, while the specification says that a fixed length of 16 octets
must be applied.  This could allows an attacker to provide a truncated
Authentication Tag and to modify the JWE accordingly.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
0.6.1+dfsg1-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cjose packages.

For the detailed security status of cjose please refer to
its security tracker page at:
