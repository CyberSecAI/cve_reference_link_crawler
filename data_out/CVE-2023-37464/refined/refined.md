{
    "CVE-2023-37464": {
        "Description": "An incorrect implementation of AES GCM decryption in cjose, a C library implementing the JOSE standard may allow an attacker to provide a truncated Authentication Tag and modify the JWE object.",
        "Root cause": "The AES GCM decryption routine incorrectly uses the Tag length from the actual Authentication Tag provided in the JWE object, while the specification mandates a fixed length of 16 octets.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Incorrect Authentication Tag length usage."
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker can provide a truncated Authentication Tag and modify the JWE object, leading to integrity compromise.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "By providing a crafted JWE object with a truncated Authentication Tag."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted JWE objects to a system using the vulnerable cjose library."
    }
