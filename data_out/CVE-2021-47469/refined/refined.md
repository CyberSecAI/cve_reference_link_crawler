Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2021-47469.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a deadlock that occurs when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses. The global `spi_add_lock` is taken when adding new SPI devices. If a SPI device is itself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI devices, a deadlock occurs because the process tries to register and instantiate those devices while still holding the global `spi_add_lock` from the parent controller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deadlock due to improper locking mechanism in SPI device registration.
- Global mutex used for operations that should be per-controller.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System-level deadlock, leading to denial of service.
- Prevents SPI devices from being added correctly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the addition of a SPI device that is also a SPI controller.
- Using a SPI multiplexer (spi-mux) to instantiate multiple SPI devices that then require registration and lead to the nested locking.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the registration of a SPI device that acts as a SPI controller.
- Specifically, an attacker needs to be able to trigger the registration of such a device which will then trigger the registration of another device on the same controller, while the parent device is still holding the lock.
