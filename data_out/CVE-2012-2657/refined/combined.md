Subject: CVE id request: Multiple buffer overflow in unixODBC

Hi, please assign a CVE id for the issue:

Multiple buffer overflow in unixODBC
===========================

The library unixODBC doesn't check properly the input from FILEDSN=,
DRIVER= options in the DSN,
which causes buffer overflow when passed to the SQLDriverConnect() function.

The unixODBC maintainer has been notified about the issue.

Version affected
============

FILEDSN= as of 2.0.10
DRIVER= as of 2.3.1

PoC
===

$ ./poc "FILEDSN=$(python -c "print 'A'*10000")"
Segmentation fault

(gdb) bt
 #0  0x00007ffff7bc8c81 in SQLReadFileDSN (pszFileName=<value optimized

Agree, anything that parses such connect string can be crashed this
way.  The question is if any trust boundary is crossed with that, which
depends on whether there are any apps that allow untrusted connect
strings.

Anyone having shell access to run isql directly should be assumed to
have ability to edit ~/.odbcinst.ini, which should be enough to crash
isql or inject code to it without having to trigger one of the
mentioned overflows.

For PHP applications, would you assume attacker can typically control
settings as database name, host, port or username?  It's not really
quite common.  Possible use cases that come to mind:

- DB management application similar to phpMyAdmin, that may take some
  DB connection info as input from user.  If something like that exists
  for ODBC, another question would be if the info from user can
  actually be used to sneak in values for FILEDSN or DRIVER.
- Of course, this may allow safe_mode bypass, which may not be possible
  via odbcinst.ini (e.g. PHP script may not be allowed to edit it and
  safe_mode does not allow setting ODBCINSTINI environment variable).

It isn't limited to the configuration files. Such input can be passed
to the `isql' interactive tool that come together unixODBC. The same
string can be used to connect through PHP PDO, for example.

$ pwd
.../unixodbc/src/unixODBC-2.3.1/exe
$ ./isql "FILEDSN=$(python -c "print 'A'*10000");UID=user" -k
Segmentation fault

If it isn't characterized a security issue I'm sorry.

Thanks.

Forgot to follow up, in light of this I think it's safe to let the CVE
stand as is.

Splitting into two CVE's due to the different versions affected:

Please use CVE-2012-2657 for unixODBC 2.0.10 buffer overflow in FILEDSN=

Please use CVE-2012-2658 for unixODBC 2.3.1 buffer overflow in DRIVER=
