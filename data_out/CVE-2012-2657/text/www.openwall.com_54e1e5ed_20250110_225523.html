It isn't limited to the configuration files. Such input can be passed
to the `isql' interactive tool that come together unixODBC. The same
string can be used to connect through PHP PDO, for example.

$ pwd
.../unixodbc/src/unixODBC-2.3.1/exe
$ ./isql "FILEDSN=$(python -c "print 'A'*10000");UID=user" -k
Segmentation fault

If it isn't characterized a security issue I'm sorry.

Thanks.
