### Description

The LearnPress – WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'save\_post\_materials' function in versions up to, and including, 4.2.6.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Instructor-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
