Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, focusing on CVE-2023-45555:

**CVE-2023-45555 Analysis (Loose Filtering)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of allowed file extensions during image uploads. Specifically, the code attempts to remove 'php', 'bat', 'js', '.', and ';' from the allowed extensions but can be bypassed by using a variation of 'php', such as 'pphphp', because the filtering is not recursive or comprehensive.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Inadequate input sanitization and filtering. The system relies on a basic string replacement (`str_replace`) which is easily bypassed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By manipulating the image extension parameter, an attacker can upload files with executable extensions (like .php), potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A POST request to the `/admin/save.php?act=saveupload` endpoint. The attacker modifies the `imageext` parameter to include `pphphp`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the admin panel to configure upload settings. They need to be able to craft and send a POST request with the modified parameter.

**Additional Notes**
* The content also details another related vulnerability, CVE-2023-45554, which is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability, but it is a consequence of the weakness in CVE-2023-45555.
