```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of EMF files within PDF-XChange Editor, where a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data leads to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Insufficient data validation"
   ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information. When combined with other vulnerabilities, it could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to lure the user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a crafted EMF file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious EMF file and have the user interact with it via a website or by opening the file with the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required. User interaction is required."
