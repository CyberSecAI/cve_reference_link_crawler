## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MF Gig Calendar <= 1.2.1 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as editor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "MF Gig Calendar > Settings"
2. In the "Empty Calendar" field, add the payload: `
</textarea><script>alert(/XSS: mfgigcal\_settings[message]/)</script>`
3. Click "Save Changes" and see the XSS.
