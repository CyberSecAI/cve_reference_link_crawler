Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-34709:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is that session tokens in Directus were not properly invalidated upon logout. Although the `directus_session` was destroyed and the cookie was deleted, the session token itself (which is a JWT) remained valid until its expiry time (default 1 day). This essentially turned the session token into a long-lived, unrevokable stateless token instead of a stateful session token.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper session management:** The core issue is the lack of proper session invalidation. The system did not check the validity of the session token against the actual session status in the database.
*   **Long-lived tokens:** Session tokens were configured to remain valid for a relatively long period (1 day by default), increasing the window of opportunity for exploitation.
*   **Stateless token used as stateful:** The stateless nature of the JWT was not aligned with the stateful intent of session tokens.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Session hijacking:** An attacker who has obtained a session token (e.g., by copying it from a cookie) could use it to impersonate the user even after the user has logged out.
*   **Access from shared computers:** Users on shared devices, such as public computers, were vulnerable to having their sessions accessed later by an attacker if the attacker managed to get the token.
*   **Increased attack success:** The vulnerability made certain attacks more likely to succeed due to the lack of proper session expiration.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as an attacker would need to intercept or obtain the session token through network traffic or by accessing the victim's device/browser.
*   **Cookie theft/capture:** Attackers could obtain the session token by stealing the session cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to intercept/access session token:** The attacker needs to be able to obtain the session token. This could be done by intercepting network traffic, having access to the user's browser history or the user's device or via other malicious activities.
*  **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   **Affected versions:** >=10.10.0
*   **Patched versions:** 10.11.0
*   **CVSS v3 base metrics:**
    *   Attack vector: Network
    *   Attack complexity: High
    *   Privileges required: Low
    *   User interaction: Required
    *   Scope: Unchanged
    *   Confidentiality: High
    *   Integrity: Low
    *   Availability: None
*   **CWE:** CWE-613 (Improper Session Management)
*  The fix implemented in commit `a6172f8a6a0f31a6bf4305a090de172ebfb63bcf` adds a check to `verifySessionJWT` function to ensure the associated session exists and has not expired in the database

This vulnerability is related to improper session management, making it possible for an attacker to reuse session tokens even after a user has logged out, leading to potential unauthorized access and session hijacking.
