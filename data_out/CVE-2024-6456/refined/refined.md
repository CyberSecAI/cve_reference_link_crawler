Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The AVEVA Historian Server fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to gain read and write access to the database. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially disruption of operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (AV:N).
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to socially engineer a user into opening a specially crafted URL.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required (UI:R) as the targeted user needs to click a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create a malicious URL and socially engineer a user into clicking it.
* The attacker does not require any privileges on the system. (PR:N)
* The attacker can be remote.

**Affected Products:**

*   AVEVA Historian Server: Version 2023 R2
*   AVEVA Historian Server: Versions 2023 to 2023 P03
*   AVEVA Historian Server: Versions 2020 to 2020 R2 SP1 P01

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is present in the Historian REST Interface.
* A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) and CVSS v4 score of 8.5 (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) were calculated for this vulnerability.
* The affected products are used in critical infrastructure sectors, primarily in Critical Manufacturing.
