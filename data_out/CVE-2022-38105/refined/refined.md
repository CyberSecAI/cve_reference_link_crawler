- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `cm_processREQ_NC` opcode handler of the `cfg_server` binary, where the provided `master_key` is used as an AES encryption key, but its size is not explicitly checked to be 0x20 bytes as required by AES-256. When a master key of insufficient length is provided, a heap out-of-bounds read occurs, causing adjacent heap data to be incorporated into the AES key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119): The `aes_encrypt` function reads 0x20 bytes from the provided `master_key` without validating its length, leading to an out-of-bounds read if `master_key` is smaller than 0x20 bytes.
    - Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read results in the leakage of heap data through the encrypted response to the `cm_processREQ_NC` request.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to leak sensitive heap data from the router's memory. This data includes thread stack addresses, which can potentially be used for further exploitation or to gain insights into the internal workings of the device.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted network packets to the router on TCP port 7788.
    - The attacker first sends a `cm_processREQ_KU` request to obtain the router's public RSA key.
    - Using the RSA key, the attacker then sends a `cm_processREQ_NC` request with a manipulated `master_key` that is smaller than 0x20 bytes, triggering the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to TCP port 7788 on the vulnerable Asus RT-AX82U router. This can be achieved if the attacker is on the same network or if remote administration is enabled on the router and accessible to the attacker.
    - No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, as `cm_processREQ_KU` and `cm_processREQ_NC` can be used without authentication.
