Note: this version removes the discontinued “Yahoo” profile field, which may have been customized for other purposes.

## Upgrading to this Version

To upgrade: copy and overwrite the files, and run the `install/` **upgrade script**.

Before performing any upgrade, remember to **backup** your forum’s files and database and store them safely.

If you have edited core files, including language files, please make sure you make a changelog for these changes so you can make them again (if necessary) once the upgrade is complete.
