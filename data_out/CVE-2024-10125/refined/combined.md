# CVE-2024-10125 - missing JWT issuer and signer validation in aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore

**Publication Date: 2024/10/21 4:00 PM PDT**

**Description:**

The [Amazon.ApplicationLoadBalancer.Identity.AspNetCore repo](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore#validatetokensignature) contains Middleware that can be used in conjunction with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) OpenId Connect integration and can be used in any [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) Core deployment scenario, including AWS Fargate, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and AWS Lambda. In the JWT handling code, it performs signature validation but fails to validate the JWT issuer and signer identity. The signer omission, if combined with a scenario where the infrastructure owner allows internet traffic to the ALB targets (not a recommended configuration), can allow for JWT signing by an untrusted entity and an actor may be able to mimic valid OIDC-federated sessions to the ALB targets.

**Affected versions:** all versions

**Resolution**

The repository/package has been deprecated, is End of Life, and is no longer actively supported.

**Workarounds**

As a security best practice, ensure that your ELB targets (e.g. EC2 Instances, Fargate Tasks etc.) do not have public IP addresses.

Ensure any forked or derivative code validate that the signer attribute in the JWT match the ARN of the Application Load Balancer that the service is configured to use.

**References**

* [ALB Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html) specifically "To ensure security, you must verify the signature before doing any authorization based on the claims and validate that the signer field in the JWT header contains the expected Application Load Balancer ARN."
* [Python example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html#user-claims-encoding)
* [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore/security/advisories/GHSA-5gh5-cc5m-q244)
* [CVE-2024-10125](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10125)

We would like to thank Miggo Security for collaborating on this issue through the coordinated disclosure process.

## Description

### Summary

The [Amazon.ApplicationLoadBalancer.Identity.AspNetCore repo](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore#validatetokensignature) contains Middleware that can be used in conjunction with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) OpenId Connect integration and can be used in any [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) Core deployment scenario, including Fargate, EKS, ECS, EC2, and Lambda. In the JWT handling code, it performs signature validation but fails to validate the JWT issuer and signer identity. The signer omission, if combined with a scenario where the infrastructure owner allows internet traffic to the ALB targets (not a recommended configuration), can allow for JWT signing by an untrusted entity and an actor may be able to mimic valid OIDC-federated sessions to the ALB targets.

### Impact

An actor may be able to mimic valid OIDC-federated sessions to the ALB targets, using a JWT signed by a different load balancer.

### Patches

The repository/package has been deprecated, is End of Life, and is no longer actively supported.

### Workarounds

As a security best practice, ensure that your ELB targets (e.g. EC2 Instances, Fargate Tasks etc.) do not have public IP addresses.

Ensure any forked or derivative code validate that the signer attribute in the JWT match the ARN of the Application Load Balancer that the service is configured to use.

### References

* [ALB Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html) specifically "To ensure security, you must verify the signature before doing any authorization based on the claims and validate that the signer field in the JWT header contains the expected Application Load Balancer ARN."

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
