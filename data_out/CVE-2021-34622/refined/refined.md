- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's profile update functionality allowed users to modify their user metadata, including the `wp_capabilities` field, without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -   **Privilege Escalation:** Unauthenticated users could register an account due to a missing check to validate if user registration was enabled. Then, an authenticated user could send a request to update their profile with a crafted `wp_capabilities` parameter to gain administrator privileges.
    -   **Insecure User Meta Update:** The profile update functionality directly updated user metadata based on user-supplied key-value pairs without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could escalate their privileges to that of an administrator, gaining full control of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via HTTP requests to the plugin's profile update endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers needed an account on the vulnerable site to exploit this. This account could be created even if user registration was disabled.
