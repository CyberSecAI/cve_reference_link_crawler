- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Website Monetization by MageNet plugin versions <= 1.0.29.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing malicious actors to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or other malicious activities, although specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or opening a malicious webpage that submits a forged request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user to perform a request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
