- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the encryption method used for the backup function in Cisco UCS Central Software. Specifically, a static key is used for the backup configuration feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Use of a static key for encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to a backup file can decrypt it and learn sensitive information stored within, such as:
    - Local user credentials
    - Authentication server passwords
    - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community names
    - Device SSL server certificate and key
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs access to a backup file of the Cisco UCS Central Software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to a backup file, which may involve local access (AV:L), or they may need to socially engineer the user to obtain the backup file. User interaction (UI:R) is required for the attack to be successful (e.g. user must copy the file and transfer it to an attacker).
