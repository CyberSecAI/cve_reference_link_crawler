{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "During subvolume creation in btrfs, an ASSERT() was triggered when the newly created subvolume was read before the btrfs_get_new_fs_root() function was called. This was due to backref walks which could read the subvolume and assign a new anonymous device number before the expected time.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect assumption that a newly created subvolume would not be accessed before being fully initialized.",
      "Use of ASSERT() to check for a condition which could occur due to other kernel processes."
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel crash due to the failed ASSERT() statement.",
    "attack_vectors": "Backref walk or other kernel processes accessing the new subvolume before btrfs_get_new_fs_root() is called.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger a subvolume creation and have other processes concurrently accessing the filesystem."
  },
  "fixes": [
        "The ASSERT() statement was removed from the btrfs_get_root_ref function.",
        "The preallocated anon_dev is freed and reset if the subvolume has already been read and assigned a device number."

   "CVE_information": {
        "description": "The provided text describes a bug fix in the btrfs filesystem where an assertion was incorrectly triggered during subvolume creation, and the fix removes that assertion. This aligns with the nature of vulnerability described in CVE-2024-26727.",
