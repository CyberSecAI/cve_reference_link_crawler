Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow during TLS handshake parsing when handling ECDH or FFDH public keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:** In TLS 1.3, a server copies up to 65535 bytes into a buffer that is smaller. In TLS 1.2 with `MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO`, a server copies up to 255 bytes into a heap buffer that is sized for a valid public key, making it smaller unless RSA or FFDH with large keys is enabled in addition to ECDH.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The code doesn't properly check the length of the received ECDH or FFDH public key before copying it into the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** A malicious peer can overwrite memory on the heap with attacker-controlled data, leading to potential remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS handshake with an overly long ECDH or FFDH public key during the TLS handshake.
- **TLS Handshake Manipulation:** The attacker specifically targets the TLS handshake process, injecting the malicious data through the public key field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated remote access:** The attacker can be an unauthenticated peer on the network.
- **Ability to initiate a TLS handshake:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TLS handshake with the vulnerable server or client.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable configuration:** The attacker needs to know if the target server is configured to support ECDH or FFDH and uses `MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO` for TLS 1.2 servers.

**Affected Versions:**
- Mbed TLS 3.2.0 and above are affected.
- Mbed TLS 2.28 is not affected.

**Unaffected Scenarios**
- The default configuration is not affected.
- TLS 1.2 clients are not affected.
- Builds without `MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO` are not affected.
- TLS 1.2 servers supporting RSA or FFDH with keys of at least 2048 bits in addition to ECDH are not affected. Note that the TLS 1.3 stack remains affected in this case.
