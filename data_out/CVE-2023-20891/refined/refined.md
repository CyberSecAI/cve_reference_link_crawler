- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the logging of credentials in hex encoding within the platform system audit logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious non-admin user with access to the platform system audit logs can access hex-encoded CF API admin credentials. This could allow them to push new, potentially malicious, versions of an application.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious non-admin user needs access to the platform system audit logs. In default deployments, non-admin users do not have this access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A malicious non-admin user would need to gain access to the platform system audit logs to exploit this vulnerability.
