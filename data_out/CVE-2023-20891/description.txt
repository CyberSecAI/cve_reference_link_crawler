The VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs and Isolation Segment contain an information disclosure vulnerability due to the logging of credentials in hex encoding in platform system audit logs.Â A malicious non-admin user who has access to the platform system audit logs can access hex encoded CF API admin credentials and can push new malicious versions of an application. In a default deployment non-admin users do not have access to the platform system audit logs.
