Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6897:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content from Wordfence explicitly mentions "CVE-2023-6897" and describes a vulnerability in "EAN for WooCommerce" plugin. This confirms relevance.
  - The content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org shows the code changes made to address the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** in the `alg_wc_ean_product_meta` shortcode.
   - The plugin fails to validate user-controlled input (`key` attribute) when retrieving post metadata.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **Missing Input Validation:** The plugin doesn't sanitize or validate the `key` attribute used in the `alg_wc_ean_product_meta` shortcode. This allows users to specify arbitrary meta keys.
   - **Information Exposure:**  Due to the missing validation, an attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information stored in post metadata.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information stored as post meta-data.
   - **Data Breach:** This could lead to data breaches where product meta or other information is leaked.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is exploited by using the `alg_wc_ean_product_meta` shortcode and injecting a malicious `key` attribute to access unintended post metadata.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access in WordPress.
   - **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker must be able to utilize shortcodes within WordPress content (posts, pages etc.)

**Additional Information**
   - The Wordfence article states the vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
   - The vulnerability was patched in version 4.9.3 of the plugin, as seen in the changelog.
   - The patch involved:
     - Sanitizing shortcode output using `wp_kses_post()`.
     - Changing from `get_post_meta()` to `$product->get_meta()` within the `alg_wc_ean_product_meta` shortcode to only retrieve product meta.
   - The change log entry in the readme.txt file indicates that the `get_post_meta` function in shortcode was replaced with `$product->get_meta()` to ensure only product meta is retrieved.

**Summary:**
CVE-2023-6897 is an IDOR vulnerability caused by the lack of input validation in the `alg_wc_ean_product_meta` shortcode of the EAN for WooCommerce plugin. This flaw could be exploited by authenticated users to expose potentially sensitive metadata. The vulnerability was addressed in version 4.9.3 by sanitizing the shortcode output and using `$product->get_meta()` function.
