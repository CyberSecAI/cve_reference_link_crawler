### Description

The EAN for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.2 via the the 'alg\_wc\_ean\_product\_meta' shortcode due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to expose potentially sensitive post metadata.
