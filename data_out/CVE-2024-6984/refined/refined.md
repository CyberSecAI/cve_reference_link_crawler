```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from overly broad file permissions on `/var/lib/juju/` allowing unprivileged users to access sensitive information, combined with the leaking of the `JUJU_CONTEXT_ID` in error messages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information",
    "CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management",
    "CWE-284: Improper Access Control"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged user can gain access to any secret, configuration, relation data, and even the private key of a charm. This can lead to privilege escalation, arbitrary access, and potentially remote access to the target application.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to a charm node via an unprivileged user account. This could be via a compromised container or the underlying host.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have local access to a node running a charm with an unprivileged user account. They also need to be able to execute commands. They do not need user interaction to exploit this vulnerability."
