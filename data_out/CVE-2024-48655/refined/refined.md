Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `new Function()` in the `func.js` file of Total.js CMS. The `meta.total` parameter, which is taken directly from user input, is used to construct a new JavaScript function's body without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side JavaScript Code Injection:**  User-controlled data is directly incorporated into a string that is then executed as code by the server. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `meta.total` parameter is not sanitized before being used in `new Function()`, which allows for injection of malicious code.
*   **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Methods:** Even though server-side scripts are intended for widgets, access to sensitive methods like `process` is not restricted, allowing attackers to perform system-level operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*  **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive system information, such as environment variables (`process.env`), and exfiltrate it.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can use `process.exit()` to terminate the server's process, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the `meta.total` parameter when creating or editing a widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to create or edit widgets in the Total.js CMS.  According to a comment by a collaborator, this requires admin access.
