Hi, we are a research group to help developers build secure applications. We designed a cryptographic misuse detector on Java language(Our main concern is the secure implementation and use of Json Web Token). We found your great public repository and several security issues detected by our detector are shown in the following.

We found it is supported to set iteration count toward setting header parameter “p2c”，when using PBE algorithm to generate JWE. And the library does not check the count of iterations, so users may set the number of iterations to be less than 1000.

```
        long iterationCount = 500L;\\
        encryptingJwe.setHeader(HeaderParameterNames.PBES2_ITERATION_COUNT, iterationCount);

```

We think that the library need also limit the number of iterations specified by the user, and not allow to set the iteration count less than 1000. Because some inexperienced developers may set an insecure iteration count.

   I think it’d make sense to put a check in `Pbes2HmacShaWithAesKeyWrapAlgorithm.deriveForEncrypt(...)` that fails if the iteration count is less than 1000.

[NAME OF AFFECTED PRODUCT(S)]: Jose4j

[AFFECTED AND/OR FIXED VERSION(S)]: before version 0.9.3

[PROBLEM TYPE]:

Vulnerability Type: Weak Cryptographic Hash: Insecure PBE Iteration Count

Root Cause: CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy

[DESCRIPTION]: jose4j is a JWT (JSON Web Token) library used for generating and verifying JWTs. The jose4j library supports the use of the PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm to protect JWT tokens. Within the jose4j library, it allows for setting a too small iteration count when using the PBE algorithm.

The iteration count is traditionally used to increase the cost of key derivation from a password. If the iteration count is set too low, it can increase the feasibility of attacks because attackers may compute a "rainbow table" for the application and more easily determine hashed password values.

It's essential to set an appropriate and secure iteration count to ensure the security of PBE-based JWT protection and protect against potential attacks.
