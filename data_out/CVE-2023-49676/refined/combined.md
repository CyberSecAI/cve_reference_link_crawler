#### Impact

The CODESYS Development System V2.3 allows corrupt project files to be opened after confirmation of a warning dialog so that legitimate users can possibly copy project fragments into a new project. This functionality does not sufficiently secure the loading of malicious project files and is therefore susceptible to the memory corruption vulnerabilities mentioned in the CVEs.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

CODESYS GmbH strongly recommends only opening projects from trustworthy sources!
If the following dialog appears when opening a project, please pay attention to this warning and do not try to load the affected project:
"The project file is corrupt. Would you still like to try to load the project?
Attention! CODESYS could become unstable when loading a corrupt project file."
In addition, we recommend saving projects with password encryption, which offers even more protection against tampering of the project.

**Remediation**

Update the CODESYS Development System V2.3 to version 2.3.9.73.
As of this version, projects recognized as corrupt can no longer be opened with the CODESYS Development System V2.3. If the CODESYS Development System V2.3 detects that the project file has been manipulated, the user will be informed, and the loading will be terminated.

Note: CODESYS V2.3 is currently in the service phase. Please consider upgrading to CODESYS V3.
Please visit the CODESYS download area for more information on how to obtain the software update.
