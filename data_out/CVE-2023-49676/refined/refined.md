  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free (CWE-416)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can cause the application to crash by opening a specially crafted project file.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local, by tricking a user into opening a malicious project file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious project file to the user. The attacker has to be local to the system."
