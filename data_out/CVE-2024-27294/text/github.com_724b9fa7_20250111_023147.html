This now recreates a Go installation if any of its files or directories
have the wrong owner or group.

|  |  |  |
|  |  | As part of the security fix mentioned above, it became necessary to be more |
|  |  | agressive about ensuring that the owner and group of files in the installation |
|  |  | are correct. dp-golang now deletes and recreates any Go installation it finds |
|  |  | that has a file or directory with the wrong owner or group. |
