Security: ignore file ownership when extracting Go

```
Certain Go tarballs specified that some files, such as the `go` binary,
were supposed to be owned by a non-root user. When running as root,
dp-golang extracted those files and preserved ownership, which lead to
those files being writable by a non-root user.

Affected Go tarballs:

  * Go for macOS version 1.4.3 through 1.21rc3, inclusive.
  * go1.4-bootstrap-20170518.tar.gz
  * go1.4-bootstrap-20170531.tar.gz

This switches to extracting the tarballs with `tar`’s `--no-same-owner`
and `--no-same-permissions` flags.

|  |  | ### Security fix |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Certain Go tarballs (see below) had files owned by non-root users: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ❯ curl -SsL https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.14.darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar -tzvf - | head -3 |
|  |  | drwxr-xr-x 0 0 0 0 Feb 2 10:19 go/ |
|  |  | -rw-r--r-- 0 gopher wheel 1339 Feb 2 10:09 go/CONTRIBUTING.md |
|  |  | -rw-r--r-- 0 gopher wheel 1479 Feb 2 10:09 go/LICENSE |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In this case, the non-root user in question mapped to the first user created on |
|  |  | the macOS system (UID 501). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When running as root, previous versions of dp-golang would preserve file |
|  |  | ownership when extracting the tarball, even if `owner` was set to something |
|  |  | else. \*\*This meant that files, such as the `go` binary, ended up being writable |
|  |  | by a non-root user.\*\* |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This version of dp-golang enables [`tar`]’s `--no-same-owner` and |
|  |  | `--no-same-permissions` flags, which cause files to be extracted as the user |
|  |  | running Puppet, or as the user/group specified in the Puppet code. |
