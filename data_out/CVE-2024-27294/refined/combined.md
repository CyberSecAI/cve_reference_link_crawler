# Go installation could be owned by wrong user

High

[danielparks](/danielparks)
published
GHSA-8h8m-h98f-vv84
Feb 29, 2024

## Package

dp-golang
(Puppet)

## Affected versions

<1.2.7

## Patched versions

1.2.7

## Description

### Summary

dp-golang could install files — including the compiler binary — with the wrong ownership when all of the following were true:

* Puppet was run as root
* Using dp-golang version < 1.2.7
* The installed package was:
  + On macOS: Go version 1.4.3 through 1.21rc3, inclusive.
  + go1.4-bootstrap-20170518.tar.gz
  + go1.4-bootstrap-20170531.tar.gz

The user and group specified in Puppet code were ignored for files within the archive.

### Explanation

dp-golang uses `tar` to extract Go installations into place. When running as root, `tar` by default honors the ownership of entries in the installation tarball. Go installation archives listed below have files owned by a non-root user, so `tar` applied that ownership as best it could on installation.

A check of the archives on <https://go.dev/dl> found a number of installation archives with files owned by `gopher`, `kbuilder`, or just UID 501 or 502.

* For macOS: Go versions 1.4.3 through 1.21rc3, inclusive
* go1.4-bootstrap-20170518.tar.gz
* go1.4-bootstrap-20170531.tar.gz

Go versions 1.21.0 and beyond on macOS are not affected (all entries are owned by UID 0).

### Impact

This could result in the Go installation being modifiable by a non-root user. In the worst case, the user could modify the compiler to insert vulnerabilities into packages that were then run by privileged users on the same system, or on other systems entirely.

### Patches

dp-puppet version 1.2.7 will recreate installations if the owner or group of any file or directory within that installation does not match the requested owner or group. New and recreated installations will have the correct owner and group for all files and directories.

### Workarounds

The Go installation may be `chown`ed to the proper ownership, but this does not guarantee that it has not been modified.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

|  |  | As part of the security fix mentioned above, it became necessary to be more |
|  |  | agressive about ensuring that the owner and group of files in the installation |
|  |  | are correct. dp-golang now deletes and recreates any Go installation it finds |
|  |  | that has a file or directory with the wrong owner or group. |

Security: ignore file ownership when extracting Go

```
Certain Go tarballs specified that some files, such as the `go` binary,
were supposed to be owned by a non-root user. When running as root,
dp-golang extracted those files and preserved ownership, which lead to
those files being writable by a non-root user.

Affected Go tarballs:

  * Go for macOS version 1.4.3 through 1.21rc3, inclusive.
  * go1.4-bootstrap-20170518.tar.gz
  * go1.4-bootstrap-20170531.tar.gz

This switches to extracting the tarballs with `tar`’s `--no-same-owner`
and `--no-same-permissions` flags.

|  |  | ### Security fix |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Certain Go tarballs (see below) had files owned by non-root users: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ❯ curl -SsL https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.14.darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar -tzvf - | head -3 |
|  |  | drwxr-xr-x 0 0 0 0 Feb 2 10:19 go/ |
|  |  | -rw-r--r-- 0 gopher wheel 1339 Feb 2 10:09 go/CONTRIBUTING.md |
|  |  | -rw-r--r-- 0 gopher wheel 1479 Feb 2 10:09 go/LICENSE |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In this case, the non-root user in question mapped to the first user created on |
|  |  | the macOS system (UID 501). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When running as root, previous versions of dp-golang would preserve file |
|  |  | ownership when extracting the tarball, even if `owner` was set to something |
|  |  | else. \*\*This meant that files, such as the `go` binary, ended up being writable |
|  |  | by a non-root user.\*\* |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This version of dp-golang enables [`tar`]’s `--no-same-owner` and |
|  |  | `--no-same-permissions` flags, which cause files to be extracted as the user |
|  |  | running Puppet, or as the user/group specified in the Puppet code. |
