- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected products do not properly enforce restrictions on excessive authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts (CWE-307).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can conduct brute-force attacks against user passwords. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the system or data, though the impact is rated as low confidentiality, no integrity, and no availability impact in the CVSS score.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated remote attacker.
