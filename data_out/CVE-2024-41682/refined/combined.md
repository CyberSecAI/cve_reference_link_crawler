VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-41681

The web server of affected products is configured to support weak ciphers by default. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker in an on-path position to to read and modify any data passed over the connection between legitimate clients and the affected device.

| CWE | CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-41682

Affected products do not properly enforce restriction of excessive authentication attempts. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to conduct brute force attacks against legitimate user passwords.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 5.3 |

| CWE | CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-41683

Affected products do not properly enforce a strong user password policy. This could facilitate a brute force attack against legitimate user passwords.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 5.3 |
