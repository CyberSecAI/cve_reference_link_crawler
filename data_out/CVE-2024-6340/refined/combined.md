### Description

The Premium Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Countdown widget in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.36 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.10.36 and fully patched in version 4.10.37.

Over the years I have tried many different plugins to extend the functionality offered by Elementor. Some are better than others in the free/premium offerings.
I must say that I’m completely satisfied with the offer from Premium Addons. While I understand the benefit of a subscription model I appreciate any plugin that offers lifetime licenses with support the way PA does.
The list of widgets keeps growing and I rarely have to add more plugins to get the effect or look I want.
The templates included are also very helpful to quickly create drafts for client approval on layouts.
