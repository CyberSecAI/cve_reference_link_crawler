{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper initialization of memory within the parsing of responses from AT+CMGR commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized memory access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local attackers can disclose sensitive information from the affected oFono installations. Combined with other vulnerabilities, this can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of root.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required, specifically the ability to execute code on the target modem.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target modem."
