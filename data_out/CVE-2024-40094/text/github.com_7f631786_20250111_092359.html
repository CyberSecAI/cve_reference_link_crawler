### @andimarek **[andimarek](/andimarek)** commented [Mar 21, 2024](#issue-2198913777) • edited by bbakerman Loading

This adds the ability to short cut ENF creation when a maximum number of nodes has been reached

It also captures the node count in the result object as well as the maximum depth seen.

The good faith introspection now uses this to more quickly check if the introspection query is in good faith in terms of how many ENF nodes it will create

Sorry, something went wrong.

###
[`v22.0`](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0):
22.0

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like \"field names\" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

### Major Changes

#### [@&#8203;defer](https://togithub.com/defer) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `\"true\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"3.14\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"42\"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

For more, see
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3553](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3553)
JS reference implementation:
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

### Release Notes

###
[`v22.0`](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0>):
22.0

[Compare
Source](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0>)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like "field names" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

### Major Changes

#### [@&[#8203](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/8203);defer](<https://togithub.com/defer>) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md>

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `"true"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"3.14"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"42"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0>),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%29)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%29))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts>

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>graphql-java/graphql-java
(com.graphql-java:graphql-java)</summary>

###
[`v22.0`](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0):
22.0

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like \"field names\" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

### Major Changes

#### [@&#8203;defer](https://togithub.com/defer) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `\"true\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"3.14\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"42\"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>graphql-java/graphql-java
(com.graphql-java:graphql-java)</summary>

###
[`v22.0`](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0>):
22.0

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like "field names" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%29)

#### The full list of performance related changes

### Major Changes

#### [@&[#8203](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/8203);defer](<https://togithub.com/defer>) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md>

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `"true"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"3.14"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"42"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0>),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%29)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%29))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

###
[`v22.0`](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0):
22.0

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like \"field names\" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

### Major Changes

#### [@&#8203;defer](https://togithub.com/defer) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `\"true\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"3.14\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"42\"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>graphql-java/graphql-java
(com.graphql-java:graphql-java)</summary>

###
[`v22.0`](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0>):
22.0

[Compare
Source](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0>)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like "field names" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%29)

### Major Changes

#### [@&[#8203](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/8203);defer](<https://togithub.com/defer>) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md>

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `"true"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"3.14"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"42"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0>),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%29)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%29))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts>

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

###
[`v22.0`](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0):
22.0

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like \"field names\" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

### Major Changes

#### [@&#8203;defer](https://togithub.com/defer) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `\"true\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"3.14\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"42\"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>graphql-java/graphql-java
(com.graphql-java:graphql-java)</summary>

###
[`v22.0`](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0>):
22.0

[Compare
Source](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0>)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like "field names" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%29)

### Major Changes

#### [@&[#8203](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/8203);defer](<https://togithub.com/defer>) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md>

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `"true"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"3.14"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"42"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0>),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%29)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%29))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts>

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

###
[`v22.0`](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0):
22.0

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like \"field names\" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

### Major Changes

#### [@&#8203;defer](https://togithub.com/defer) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `\"true\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"3.14\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"42\"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>graphql-java/graphql-java
(com.graphql-java:graphql-java)</summary>

###
[`v22.0`](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0>):
22.0

[Compare
Source](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0>)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like "field names" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%29)

### Major Changes

#### [@&[#8203](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/8203);defer](<https://togithub.com/defer>) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md>

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `"true"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"3.14"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"42"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0>),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%29)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%29))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts>

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

###
[`v22.0`](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0):
22.0

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like \"field names\" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

### Major Changes

#### [@&#8203;defer](https://togithub.com/defer) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `\"true\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"3.14\"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `\"42\"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.

22.0

[Compare
Source](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/compare/v21.5...v22.0>)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release,
whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in
discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the
name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in
this release.

### Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no
different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure
more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is
running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster
because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory
pressure.

#### ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into
a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value.
This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was
unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is
that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to
receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is
an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name
of memory pressure performance.

#### CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses
`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together
results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new
code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a
promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside
itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1
of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3
and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher
that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a
`CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together
using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose`
and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code
patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but
rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often
just values immediately available to be used and allocating a
`CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory
pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now
just return `Object` where that object might be either a
`CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```java
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {

```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only
been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and
async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it
might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value
case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in
GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean
code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture`
values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated
way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of
memory used.

#### Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be
given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```java
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```java
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something
was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics
because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or
an exception

```java
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of
deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more
performant shape of passing in
`graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in
place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have
also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in
terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated
methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

#### Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings
like "field names" so that we create less String instances when
processing field names in queries that we know must be previously
interned in the schema.

[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504%29)

### Major Changes

#### [@&[#8203](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/8203);defer](<https://togithub.com/defer>) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental
fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL
specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage
and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md>

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to
be included in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact
there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

#### Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference
implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue`
coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key
change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

- String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example,
a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be
accepted.
- Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For
example, a `String` input `"true"` will no longer be accepted.
- Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"3.14"` will no longer be accepted.
- Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a
`String` input `"42"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version
21.0](<https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0>),
we introduced the InputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188%29)
(and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor
[[https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218](https://togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218)](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218%29))
to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor
and modify values.

JS reference implementation:
<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts>

#### Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even
up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many
methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we
don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their
own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as
mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`
and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be
compatibility challenges in existing code.

#### DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now
built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an
instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation`
and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been
removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself.
`DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This
also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are
dispatched.

#### SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain
errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a
support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in
that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information
(PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes
like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that
logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a
compliant manner of your choosing.
