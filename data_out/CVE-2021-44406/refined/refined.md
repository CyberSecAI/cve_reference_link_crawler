The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44406.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `GetAutoFocus` API's JSON `param` parser within the `cgiserver.cgi` binary incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element will always be a JSON object. It uses the subscription operator to access this element. When the `param` is not an object (e.g., an empty string), this leads to an assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The `cgiserver.cgi` does not properly validate the type of the `param` JSON element before accessing it.
- Incorrect assumption about JSON structure: The API parameter parser incorrectly assumes the `param` field will always be a JSON object.
- Denial of Service: The assertion failure causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, leading to a device reboot and a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service, as the device reboots due to the crash of the `cgiserver.cgi` process.
- This can cause disruption of the camera's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the camera's API endpoint (`/cgi-bin/api.cgi`).
- The request body contains a JSON array with a "cmd" set to "GetAutoFocus", "action" set to 0, and "param" set to an empty string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera's IP address.
- While most commands require a logged-in user, the document notes that the TALOS-2021-1420 vulnerability can be used to bypass authentication. This means an attacker could perform this attack without authentication.
