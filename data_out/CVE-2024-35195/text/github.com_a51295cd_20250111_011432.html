# Session object does not verify requests after making first request with verify=False

Moderate

[nateprewitt](/nateprewitt)
published
GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56
May 20, 2024

## Package

pip

requests
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.32.0

## Patched versions

2.32.0

## Description

When making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same origin will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool.

### Remediation

Any of these options can be used to remediate the current issue, we highly recommend upgrading as the preferred mitigation.

* Upgrade to `requests>=2.32.0`.
* For `requests<2.32.0`, avoid setting `verify=False` for the first request to a host while using a Requests Session.
* For `requests<2.32.0`, call `close()` on `Session` objects to clear existing connections if `verify=False` is used.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
