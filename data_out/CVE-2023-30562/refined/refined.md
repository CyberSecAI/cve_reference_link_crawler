Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-30562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of integrity checking on the GRE (Guardrails™ Editor) dataset file within the Systems Manager. This allows a threat actor to tamper with the file before distributing it to PCUs (Point-of-Care Units).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Dataset Integrity Checking:** The system does not properly validate the integrity of the GRE dataset file, allowing unauthorized modifications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity:** Tampering with the GRE dataset file can lead to the inadvertent activation of an undesired dataset on the PCU.
- **Availability:** Modification to the GRE dataset can potentially disable the effective use of downstream PCUs, impacting the overall availability of the system.
- **Reduced Impact (after patch):** After the partial remediation in version 12.3, the impact is reduced as the attacker cannot control the direct consequences of the tampering.  The integrity impact is lowered, and the impact on availability is removed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have access to an adjacent network to exploit this vulnerability.
- **System Manager Access:** The attacker needs generalized permissions within the Systems Manager to modify the GRE file.
- **User Interaction:**  User interaction within the Systems Manager is required to modify the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker requires access to an adjacent network and needs to have permissions within the System Manager. They also need to interact with the system.

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability has been partially remediated in BD Alaris™ System v12.3 (GRE 12.1.3) reducing the CVSS score from 6.7 (Medium) to 3.0 (Low).
-  The system has built-in features to detect integrity failures, and users are required to confirm all datasets before activation, reducing the risk.
- The document states that the risk is considered acceptable due to existing control measures and there are no reports of exploitation in any customer environment.
