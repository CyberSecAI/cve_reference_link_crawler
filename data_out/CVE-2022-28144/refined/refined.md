**CVE-2022-28144**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Proxmox Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks in certain HTTP endpoints.
    *   **CSRF vulnerability**: The endpoints do not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with `Overall/Read` permission can connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password, performing a connection test.
    *   Attackers can disable SSL/TLS validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM as part of the connection test.
    *   Attackers can test a rollback with attacker-specified parameters.
    *   The lack of POST request validation allows Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks via HTTP requests.
    *   CSRF attacks via crafted links or web pages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permission to the Jenkins instance.
    *   For CSRF attacks, the attacker needs to induce a user to visit a malicious link or webpage while logged into Jenkins.

**Additional details:**

*   The Proxmox Plugin version 0.7.0 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Proxmox Plugin version 0.7.1. The fix requires POST request for the affected HTTP endpoints and `Overall/Administer` permission.
* This CVE is related to the issue identified as SECURITY-2082.
