Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `lsilogicRegisterWrite` function within Oracle VirtualBox.
- The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation. This allows for writing data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges.
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code within the context of the hypervisor. This indicates the potential for full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- The attacker must already have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have obtained the ability to execute high-privileged code on the guest virtual machine.
- The attacker must be able to supply specific data that triggers the out-of-bounds write during the execution of the vulnerable `lsilogicRegisterWrite` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the LsiLogicSCSI controller emulation of Oracle VirtualBox.
- Oracle has released a patch to address this issue.
- The CVSS score is 7.5, with a vector of AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impact and moderate attack complexity.

This information is consistent with the official description of CVE-2020-14647 and provides further technical details.
