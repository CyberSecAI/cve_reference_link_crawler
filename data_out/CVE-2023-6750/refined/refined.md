The provided content relates to CVE-2023-6750.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin uses publicly accessible buffer files to store in-progress backup information. These files are stored at a statically defined file path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive data exposure due to publicly accessible backup files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can download sensitive information, including database dumps, file lists, and potentially other configuration details, from the backup files while a backup job is running.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends HTTP requests to the publicly accessible URLs containing backup data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication and can be unprivileged to access the files, they need to guess/know the file locations and must time their requests correctly when backups are in progress.
