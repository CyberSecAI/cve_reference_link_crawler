## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Clone < 2.4.3 - Unauthenticated Backup Download

### Description

The plugin uses buffer files to store in-progress backup informations, which is stored at a publicly accessible, statically defined file path.

### Proof of Concept

While a backup job is running, visitors can access one of the following files (it might take a couple tries, as the timing needs to be right):
"http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-clone/wpclone\_backup/file.list",
"http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-clone/wpclone\_backup/database.sql",
"http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-clone/wpclone\_backup/prefix.txt"
