# Nautobot dynamic-group-members UI and REST API doesn't enforce permission restrictions on member objects

Moderate

[glennmatthews](/glennmatthews)
published
GHSA-qmjf-wc2h-6x3q
May 28, 2024

## Package

pip

nautobot
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=1.3.0, <1.6.23; >=2.0.0,<2.2.5

## Patched versions

1.6.23, 2.2.5

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

A user with permissions to view Dynamic Group records (`extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission) can use the Dynamic Group detail UI view (`/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/`) and/or the members REST API view (`/api/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/members/`) to list the objects that are members of a given Dynamic Group.

In versions of Nautobot between 1.3.0 (where the Dynamic Groups feature was added) and 1.6.22 inclusive, and 2.0.0 through 2.2.4 inclusive, Nautobot fails to restrict these listings based on the member object permissions - for example a Dynamic Group of Device objects will list all Devices that it contains, regardless of the user's `dcim.view_device` permissions or lack thereof.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Fixed in Nautobot 1.6.23 and 2.2.5.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

This vulnerability can be partially mitigated by removing `extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission from users; a full fix will require upgrading.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
