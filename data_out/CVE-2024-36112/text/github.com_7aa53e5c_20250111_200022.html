### @glennmatthews **[glennmatthews](/glennmatthews)** commented [May 24, 2024](#issue-2315372045) • edited Loading

# Closes #n/a

# What's Changed

* Make dynamic groups `/members/` API endpoint only return the members that a user has permission to view
* Make dynamic groups detail UI only show members that a user has permission to view
* Make object dynamic-groups detail tab only show DGs that a user has permission to view.
* Add test coverage for the above.

If accepted, we'll also want to:

* backport this changeset to `ltm-1.6` ([[LTM] Dynamic groups permissions improvements #5762](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5762))
* implement a similar set of changes in `next` for the static groups feature. ([Enforce user object permissions when viewing Static Group members #5761](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5761))

# TODO

* Explanation of Change(s)
* Added change log fragment(s) (for more information see [the documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/#creating-changelog-fragments))
* n/a Attached Screenshots, Payload Example
* Unit, Integration Tests
* n/a Documentation Updates (when adding/changing features)
* n/a Example App Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Outline Remaining Work, Constraints from Design

Sorry, something went wrong.
