Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure in Nautobot to enforce permission restrictions when listing objects that are members of a Dynamic Group. Specifically, a user with `extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission could view the members of a Dynamic Group through the UI or API, even if they lacked the necessary permissions to view those member objects directly (e.g., `dcim.view_device`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper permission checks when displaying Dynamic Group members. The system failed to verify if the user had permission to view the individual member objects within a dynamic group. This constitutes a bypass of intended access controls.
- **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability leads to information disclosure as unauthorized users can list and view objects they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker, or a user with limited permissions, could obtain sensitive information about objects within the Nautobot system, including details about devices, interfaces or other managed objects, which they would otherwise not have access to. This exposure breaches the confidentiality of those objects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web UI:** A user could access the Dynamic Group detail UI view (`/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/`) to view unauthorized objects.
- **REST API:** The members REST API view (`/api/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/members/`) could be used to list members without proper permission checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Nautobot User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account within the Nautobot system.
- **`extras.view_dynamicgroup` Permission:** The attacker must have the `extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission assigned to their user account to access the Dynamic Group view and API.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the Nautobot server's web interface or API endpoints.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Nautobot versions 1.3.0 up to 1.6.22 and 2.0.0 up to 2.2.4.
- Patches were released in versions 1.6.23 and 2.2.5.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.3.
-  The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-280, which is "Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges".
