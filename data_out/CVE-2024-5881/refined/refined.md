Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `wbc_image` shortcode of the Webico Slider Flatsome Addons plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided attributes, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts. Specifically, the attributes of the `wbc_image` shortcode are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. When a user visits the page containing the injected script, the malicious code will execute within their browser. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Stealing user session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `wbc_image` shortcode. An authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher can insert the malicious code using the shortcode attributes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level privileges. This level of access allows users to create and edit posts, where they can include shortcodes.
*   **Shortcode knowledge:** The attacker must be able to utilize shortcodes and be aware of the `wbc_image` shortcode parameters to inject the malicious code.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Webico Slider Flatsome Addons plugin up to and including 2.0.1.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `wbc_slider.php` file, specifically within the `wbc_image` function.
*   The `extract( shortcode_atts(...) )` function is used to extract the shortcode attributes, which is then not properly sanitized or escaped before being included in the HTML output.
*   The provided code snippet shows the `wbc_image` function extracting several attributes such as `id`, `org_img`, `caption`, `link`, etc. None of these attributes appear to be sanitized before being used.
*   The Wordfence article recommends uninstalling the plugin as there is no known patch available at the time of writing.
