Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45754:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the listing of configured reporting jobs within the Centreon MBI component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into an input field, which is then executed by the database. This allows the attacker to potentially bypass security checks, read, modify, or delete data in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Integrity:** An attacker can modify or corrupt data within the database.
- **Availability:** An attacker could potentially disrupt the availability of the system by performing actions such as deleting data or causing errors.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, through network access.
- Input field: The vulnerability exists within the configuration pages related to reporting jobs, indicating that an attacker might exploit it by injecting malicious SQL into input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, which suggests that the vulnerability is not exploitable by anonymous users.
- **High Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to possess high privileges to access the vulnerable configuration pages, which makes this a privilege escalation or insider threat vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in the `centreon-bi-server` component.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.2, indicating a high severity.
