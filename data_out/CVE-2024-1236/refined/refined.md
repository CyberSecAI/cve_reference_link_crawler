*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated attacker (Contributor+ role) can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user visits an affected page, the injected script will execute within the user's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities like session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a registered user with at least the "Contributor" role.
    *   The attacker must be able to access the Elementor editing interface to make changes to the Filterable Gallery element.
