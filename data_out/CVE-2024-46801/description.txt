In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libfs: fix get_stashed_dentry()

get_stashed_dentry() tries to optimistically retrieve a stashed dentry
from a provided location.  It needs to ensure to hold rcu lock before it
dereference the stashed location to prevent UAF issues.  Use
rcu_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() it's effectively equivalent
with some lockdep bells and whistles and it communicates clearly that
this expects rcu protection.
