- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Fullscreen Galleria plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts into the website, potentially leading to redirects, advertisements, or other malicious HTML payloads that are executed when guests visit the site. This could lead to various issues such as unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement of the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the injection of malicious scripts via unsanitized input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker would require the ability to inject malicious scripts, which is possible through a contributor role.
