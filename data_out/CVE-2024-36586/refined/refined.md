- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The AdGuardHome binary can be overwritten by an unprivileged attacker, which leads to privilege escalation upon service restart.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Binary planting - the ability to overwrite the AdGuardHome binary with a malicious payload.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution with elevated privileges (LocalSystem on Windows or Root on Linux).
- **Attack vectors**: Local, by overwriting the AdGuardHome binary with a malicious executable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must have write access to the location where the AdGuardHome binary is stored.
    - The attacker must have a way to either wait for or induce a restart of the AdGuardHome service.
    - The AdGuardHome service must already be installed for the vulnerability to be exploited.
