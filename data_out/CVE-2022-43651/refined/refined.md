**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of SKP files within Bentley View, specifically due to a lack of validation of object existence before operations are performed on the object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: The software attempts to access a memory location that has already been freed, leading to potential corruption and crashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- System compromise: Successful exploitation could lead to full system compromise depending on the privileges of the process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SKP file: Attackers can craft a malicious SKP file.
- User interaction is required: The target must open the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to deliver a malicious SKP file to the target user.
- The attacker needs to induce the user to open the malicious SKP file using the vulnerable application.
