I don't think this change is correct. If you have a case-insensitive column storing the data, then requiring a case-sensitive comparison in python will break some lookups. The correct way to handle this is to either make the column collation case-sensitive, or to case-fold the data on the way in when it is saved or looked up.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Better solutions are welcome. Doing the column case-sensitive requires MySQL-specific code (all other Django database backends default to case sensitive collations), which I didn't have time and motivation to develop and test.

Case-folding would break the authentication for providers relying on IDs being case-sensitive (and that's what triggered this fix), so it is definitely not an option.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity in social-auth-app-django

Moderate

[nijel](/nijel)
published
GHSA-2gr8-3wc7-xhj3
Apr 24, 2024

## Package

pip

social-auth-app-django
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<5.4.1

## Patched versions

5.4.1

## Description

### Impact

Due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match.

### Patches

This issue has been addressed by [#566](https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/pull/566) and fix released in 5.4.1.

### Workarounds

An immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field:

```
ALTER TABLE `social_auth_usersocialauth` MODIFY `uid` varchar(255) COLLATE `utf8_bin`;
```
### References

This issue was discovered by folks at <https://opencraft.com/>.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
