The database collation might vary, so use safer comparing in Python.

I don't think this change is correct. If you have a case-insensitive column storing the data, then requiring a case-sensitive comparison in python will break some lookups. The correct way to handle this is to either make the column collation case-sensitive, or to case-fold the data on the way in when it is saved or looked up.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Better solutions are welcome. Doing the column case-sensitive requires MySQL-specific code (all other Django database backends default to case sensitive collations), which I didn't have time and motivation to develop and test.

Case-folding would break the authentication for providers relying on IDs being case-sensitive (and that's what triggered this fix), so it is definitely not an option.

Sorry, something went wrong.
