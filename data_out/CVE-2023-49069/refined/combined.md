| Publication Date: | 2024-09-10 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-12-12 |

SUMMARY

Mendix Runtime contains an observable response discrepancy vulnerability when validating usernames during authentication. This could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to distinguish between valid and invalid usernames.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Note that some, Mendix Runtime version lines (main branch or LTS or MTS versions) provide a complete fix, while others still require additional actions after updating to the latest available version.
