- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mendix Runtime has an observable response discrepancy during username validation in the authentication process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Observable response discrepancy (CWE-204) during username validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can distinguish between valid and invalid usernames. This could lead to information disclosure regarding the valid usernames on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the network.
