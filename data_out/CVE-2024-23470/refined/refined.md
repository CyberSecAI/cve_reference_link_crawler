- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) has an exposed dangerous method called `UserScriptHumster`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a pre-authentication remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can run commands and executables on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based and pre-authentication, meaning no prior access to the system is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ARM server and does not need to be authenticated.
