Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2023-45966:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering and validation of the `url` field within the `locator` struct when creating comments via the `/api/v1/comment` endpoint.
- Specifically, when the "title" field is missing in the comment request, the application attempts to extract a title from the provided URL, which is not properly sanitized, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Blind SSRF (CWE-918):** The primary vulnerability is a blind SSRF, meaning an attacker can cause the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs without direct visibility into the responses.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `url` field within the `locator` struct of a comment request and the extracted title.
- **Missing "title" Field Handling:** The application's behavior when the `title` field is missing creates an exploitable scenario.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** While the SSRF is "blind", an attacker can potentially gather information about the internal network infrastructure and services by observing the server's requests to specific URLs.
- The attacker can make the server send requests to internal/external systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/v1/comment?site=<SITE_ID>` endpoint.
- **Malicious JSON Payload:** The attacker provides a malicious JSON payload where the `locator` struct includes a malicious URL in its `url` field and omits the `title` field.
- Example payload: `{"text":"qweqwe","locator":{"site":"remark","url":"[https://j5pxshabxb5037lms6z182pkjbp4d01p.oastify.com"]}}`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `/api/v1/comment` endpoint.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to send this request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was fixed in commit `efceed6` and further addressed in pull requests #1680, #1681 and #1695.
- The vulnerability affects umputun/remark42 versions <= 1.12.1.
- The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
