  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Hardware descriptor inconsistencies cause the skb data length to underflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent hardware descriptors",
      "Lack of proper handling of length underflow in the driver"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel panic due to BUG_ON() triggered by skb length underflow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By sending crafted packets that trigger the hardware inconsistencies leading to the underflow.",
       "A compromised device could potentially trigger this"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system using the affected AMD-XGBE network driver and trigger conditions that expose hardware descriptor inconsistencies. Alternatively, a rogue hardware device might send invalid data."

   "description": "The fix is to drop packets when a length underflow is detected to prevent the kernel panic.",
