The provided content relates to CVE-2024-47336.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress Terms Descriptions plugin, versions 3.4.7 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin is susceptible to XSS, which falls under the OWASP Top 10 category of "A3: Injection."

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack allows a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will then be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to various adverse effects, including unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts, which in this case is likely through the plugin's input fields. An administrator role is required to perform the attack.
