| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2278627#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-05-02 13:22:59 UTC  ``` When running a remote execution job on a host, the ssh key of the host is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite connects it anyway because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no". This can lead to MITM, DoS, leaking of whatever secrets the remote execution job contains, or whatever other issues may arise from the attacker being able to forge a ssh key. This does not directly allow unauthorized remote execution on the Satellite (although it can leak secrets leading to it)..   ``` |  |
