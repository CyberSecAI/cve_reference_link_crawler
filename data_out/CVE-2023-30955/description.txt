A security defect was identified in Foundry workspace-server that enabled a user to bypass an authorization check and view settings related to 'Developer Mode'. This enabled users with insufficient privilege the ability to view and interact with Developer Mode settings in a limited capacity. A fix was deployed with workspace-server 7.7.0.
