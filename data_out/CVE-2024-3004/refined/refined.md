Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied data in the Online Book System. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to insufficient input validation/sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they visit the affected site.
*   **Cookie Theft:** The attacker could steal cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Further Attacks:** Successful XSS exploitation can lead to a range of further attacks, such as defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or phishing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS via Product Value:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user inputs malicious code into the "value" field of a product, demonstrating a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the vulnerable page and entering malicious input within the product "value" field.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**
*   The provided information gives a detailed proof of concept, complete with screenshots, that shows exactly where the XSS vulnerability is located and how to trigger it. The steps, including the specific code to input, are provided making it easy to understand and reproduce.
*   It also specifies the vulnerable product (Online Book System) and its version (1.0).
*   The vulnerable parameters are mentioned, which is the "value" section of any product.
