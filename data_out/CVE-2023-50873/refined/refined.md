- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress "Add Any Extension to Pages" plugin versions 1.4 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, making it possible for attackers to force authenticated users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform actions they did not intend, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack involves tricking a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request to the vulnerable plugin. This is typically achieved by embedding malicious code in a website, email, or other medium that the user is likely to interact with.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in user of the vulnerable plugin to visit a malicious page or click a malicious link. They do not need to be authenticated themselves.
