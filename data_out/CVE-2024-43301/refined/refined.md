- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Fonts plugin (versions 3.7.7 and earlier) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage. This would then execute an unwanted action on the WordPress site via the fonts plugin, as if it were executed by the administrator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and successfully deliver it to a logged-in administrator. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site itself.
