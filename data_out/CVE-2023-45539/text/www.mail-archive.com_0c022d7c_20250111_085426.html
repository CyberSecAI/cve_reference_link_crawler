```
Hi,

HAProxy 2.8.2 was released on 2023/08/09. It added 73 new commits
after version 2.8.1.
```
```

It's one of these rare moments where I'm happy that we're a bit late on
releases, because it allowed us to include a backport for a vulnerability
reported this morning, saving all of us an extra release!

The high severity issues addressed in this version are the following:

  - performing multiple large-header replacements at once can sometimes
    overwrite parts of the contents of the headers if header size is
    increased. This may happen with the "replace-header" action, when the
    buffer gets too fragmented, a temporary one is needed to realign it,
    then they are permutted. But if this happens more than once, the
    allocated temporary buffer could be the one that had just been used,
    where live data will be overwritten but the new ones. This can cause
    garbage to appear in headers, and might possibly trigger some asserts
    depending on the damage and where this passes. This issue was reported
    by Christian Ruppert.

  - the H3 decoder used to properly reject malformed header names, but
    forgot to do so for header values, as was already done for H2. This
    could theoretically be used to attack servers behind, though for this
    to happen, one would need to have a QUIC listener and a tool permitting
    to send such malformed bytes (not granted).

  - the check for invalid characters on content-length header values doesn't
    reject empty headers, which can pass through. And since they don't have
    a value, they're not merged with next ones, so it is possible to pass
    a request that has both an empty content-length and a populated one.
    Such requests are invalid and the vast majority of servers will reject
    them. But there are certainly still a few non-compliant servers that
    will only look at one of them, considering the empty value equals zero
    and be fooled with this. Thus the problem is not as much for mainstream
    users as for those who develop their own HTTP stack or who purposely use
    haproxy to protect a known-vulnerable server, because these ones may be
    at risk. This issue was reported by Ben Kallus of Dartmouth College and
    Narf Industries. A CVE was filed for this one. There is a work-around,
    though: simply rejecting requests containing an empty content-length
    header will do the job:

             http-request deny if { hdr_len(content-length) 0 }

Then there are a bunch of lower severity ones, particularly:

  - the URL fragments (the part that follows '#') are not allowed to be
    sent on the wire, and their handling on the server side has long been
    ambiguous. Historically most servers would trim them, nowadays with
    stronger specification requirements most of them tend to simply reject
    the request as invalid. Till now we did neither of these, so they
    could appear at the end of the "path" sample fetch contents. It can be
    problematic in case path_end is used to route requests. For example,
    a rule doing routing "{ path_end .png .jpg }" to a static server could
    very well match "index.html#.png". The question of how best to proceed
    in this case was asked to other HTTP implementers and the consensus was
    clearly that this should be actively rejected, which is even specifically
    mandated in certain side-protocol specs. A measurement on haproxy.org
    shows that such requests appear at a rate of roughly 1 per million, and
    are either emitted by poorly written crawlers that copy-paste blocks of
    text, or are sent by vulnerability scanners. Thus a check was added for
    this corner case which is now blocked by default. In case anyone would
    discover that they're hosting a bogus application relying on this, this
    can be reverted using "option accept-invalid-http-request". This issue
    was reported by Seth Manesse and Paul Plasil.

  - the bwlim filter could cause a spinning loop in process_stream() due
    to an expiration timer that was not reset.

  - in H3, the FIN bit could be handled before the last frame was processed,
    triggering an internal error.

  - H3: the presence of a content-length header was not reported internally,
    causing the FCGI mux on the backend to stall during uploads from QUIC to
    FCGI.

  - Lua/queue: some queued items could leak and progressively cause a slowdown
    of queue:push().

  - listener: the proxy's lock is needed in relax_listener(), otherwise we
    risk a deadlock through an ABBA pattern that could happen when a listener
    gets desaturated.

  - logging too large messages to a ring can cause their loss, due to the
    maxlen parameter not being accurately calculated.

  - quic: when the free space in the buffer used to redispatch datagrams
    wraps at the end, new datagrams may be dropped until it empties, due to
    the buffer appearing full. This causes excess retransmits when multiple
    connections come from the same IP:port.

  - quic: a few issues affect the retry tokens (used when a listener is
    under flood): a check was missing on the dcid, which could probably
    be used to try to create more than one connection per token; the
    internal tick was used for the timestamp used in tokens instead of
    the wall-clock time, causing a risk that a token will fail to
    validate against another node from the same cluster; finally the
    initial vector used for random token generation was not strong
    enough. Missing parenthesis in the PTO calculation formula could
    possibly result in obscure bugs such as a connection probing
    infinitely.

  - incomplete log server definitions were added to the global list of
    servers, but freed without be delete from the list, which can cause
    all sorts of issues and crashes when walking over that list or at
    deinit() time.

  - cache: s-maxage couldn't override "max-age=0" as it ought to, according
    to the standard.

  - NUMA topology auto-detection was still active when cpu-map directives
    were present, which is contrary to what is documented since cpu-map is
    the alternative for the command-line "taskset" utility. This could
    result in haproxy running on way more cores than permitted by these
    directives (e.g. a full socket).

  - server-state: empty and missing state files would report warnings, which
    could be numerous on first start when having many backends, complicating
    the startup when "zero-warning" is set. Now they will be reported at the
    notice level instead, so that users can still fix their config typos,
    and warnings will be used for other cases (unreadable, invalid contents
    etc).

  - server name resolution: a warning would be emitted even when
    "init-addr none" was present or when starting with -dr, asking to
    explicitly disable resolution, which doesn't make sense and contradicts
    the documentation. Now it will remain silent in these two special cases.

The rest is of much lower importance or probability, and the usual DOC, CI
and cleanup stuff. Older versions will follow, reusing this changelog when
it fits.

Thanks to all those who reported issues, tested fixes and helped with the
backports!
