- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow in the `OpenDDLParser::parseStructure` function within the Assimp library, specifically during the processing of OpenGEX files. The vulnerability occurs during string manipulation when reading beyond the allocated memory buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122), out-of-bounds read due to an unsafe string length calculation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service due to a crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution through memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted (malformed) OpenGEX file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious OpenGEX file to the vulnerable software (Assimp library).
