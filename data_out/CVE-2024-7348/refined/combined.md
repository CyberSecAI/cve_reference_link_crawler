# CVE-2024-7348

### PostgreSQL relation replacement during pg\_dump executes arbitrary SQL

Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in pg\_dump in PostgreSQL allows an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the user running pg\_dump, which is often a superuser. The attack involves replacing another relation type with a view or foreign table. The attack requires waiting for pg\_dump to start, but winning the race condition is trivial if the attacker retains an open transaction. Versions before PostgreSQL 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, and 12.20 are affected.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.
