|  |  | Note that you can also use another UI image tag than `ui:latest`. For example, |
|  |  | you can specify a version of the UI such as `ui:3.6.0`. Another option is |
|  |  | to use the tag `ui:cotopaxi`, which defaults to the latest v4 version. |

|  |  | #### Security settings |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Finally, there is also an environment variable `ALLOWED\_ALGORITHM\_STORES` that |
|  |  | you can specify. If you do so, the appropriate |
|  |  | [CSP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) will be |
|  |  | set so that your UI can only access the vantage6 server and algorithm stores |
|  |  | to collect data from. You define them same as other environment variables, with |
|  |  | spaces in between each algorithm store you want to allow traffic from: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  | docker run --env ALLOWED\_ALGORITHM\_STORES="store.cotopaxi.vantage6.ai myotherstore.com" ... |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Note that if you do \*not\* specify this environment variable, the CSP policy |
|  |  | will be very lenient. In order for the UI to work properly, algorithm store |
|  |  | resources should be obtained, so if no algorithm stores are provided, all |
|  |  | URIs will be allowed. |
