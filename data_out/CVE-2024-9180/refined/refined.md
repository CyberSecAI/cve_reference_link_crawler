- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Mishandling of entries in Vault's in-memory entity cache.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A privileged Vault operator with write access to the root namespace's identity endpoint can manipulate a cached entity record, potentially escalating an entity's privileges to Vault's root policy on a specific node. The manipulated record is not propagated across the cluster or persisted in the storage backend, and would be cleared upon server restarts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A Vault operator can escalate their own or another user's privileges to the root policy, potentially gaining full control over the affected Vault node.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the identity API endpoint in the root namespace to manipulate cached entity records.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A privileged Vault operator with write permissions to the root namespace's identity endpoint is required.
