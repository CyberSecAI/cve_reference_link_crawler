Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-36276:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. Specifically, the 'SqlWhere' parameter within the 'BuscarESM' function in TCMAN GIM is vulnerable to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection (CWE-89)

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to directly interact with the database. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, as it involves sending a specially crafted request with a malicious 'SqlWhere' parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application, and must have low privileges (`PR:L`). The attack does not require user interaction (`UI:N`) and can be performed over a network (`AV:N`)
