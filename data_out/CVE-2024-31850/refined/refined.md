  "CVE-2024-31850": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a combination of how the embedded Jetty server and CData servlets handle requests. Specifically, Jetty does not reject '\\*' characters in URIs, and CData servlets process these URIs, combined with insufficient session checks on certain endpoints. This allows bypassing intended security restrictions defined in the web.xml configuration.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Path traversal",
      "Insufficient session checks",
       "Jetty server's handling of '\\*' characters in URIs",
       "Bypassing security constraint restrictions"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain access to sensitive information and perform limited actions within the CData Arc application.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable CData Arc instance using path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can bypass security checks and access restricted resources.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CData Arc instance over the network. No prior authentication is required."
