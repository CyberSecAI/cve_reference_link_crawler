The provided content is related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-39498.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A recent refactoring of the flow for payload allocation/removal in the DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport (MST) code introduced a regression. Specifically, commit 5aa1dfcdf0a4 ("drm/mst: Refactor the flow for payload allocation/removement") overwrote the fix from commit 54d217406afe ("drm: use mgr->dev in drm\_dbg\_kms in drm\_dp\_add\_payload\_part2"). This resulted in a NULL pointer dereference within the `drm_dp_add_payload_part2` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The `drm_dbg_kms` function in `drm_dp_add_payload_part2` was trying to access `state->dev`, however, the `state` parameter was unnecessary, and the intended `mgr->dev` was no longer being used. If `payload->payload_allocation_status` is not `DRM_DP_MST_PAYLOAD_ALLOCATION_DFP`, the code would attempt to access `state->dev` which can be a null pointer leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: A NULL pointer dereference leads to a kernel crash when `drm_dp_add_payload_part2` is called with a payload that failed in `drm_dp_add_payload_part1`.
- Denial of service: The crash can cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering MST payload allocation/removal: The vulnerability can be triggered during DisplayPort MST operations involving the addition of a payload, specifically when the initial payload allocation fails.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger MST payload allocation and removal. This would typically require a system with a DisplayPort output that supports MST and the ability to trigger specific error conditions during the allocation process.
