The provided content is related to CVE-2023-24585.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write that occurs during the parsing of the HTTP request method, specifically when handling characters outside the range of 0x21 to 0x7e.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper calculation of buffer length (`len`) during method parsing when non-printable characters are present before the actual method string.
- Mismatch between the buffer pointer (`p_conn->RxBufPtr`) and the remaining buffer length (`p_conn->RxBufLenRem`).
- Out-of-bounds write during key/value pair parsing, specifically in `HTTPsReq_URL_EncodeStrParse` function, when attempting to null-terminate a string beyond its allocated boundary.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption leading to potential control over the address of the next heap allocation.
- Crash of the application due to the segmentation fault caused by the out-of-bounds write.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a method string prepended with characters outside the range of 0x21 to 0x7e, followed by form data

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network requests to the affected HTTP server. No prior authentication is needed for exploitation.
