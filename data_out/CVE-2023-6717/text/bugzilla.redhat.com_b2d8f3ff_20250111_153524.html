| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2253952#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2023-12-11 08:34:32 UTC  ``` Keycloak allows arbitrary URLs as SAML Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL (ACS), including JavaScript URIs (javascript:). Allowing JavaScript URIs in combination with HTML forms leads to JavaScript evaluation in the context of the embedding origin on form submission. Thus, Keycloak is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XXS) by registering a JavaScript URI as Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2253952#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 20:26:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22.0.10  Via RHSA-2024:1868 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1868](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1868)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2253952#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 20:26:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:1867 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1867](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1867)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2253952#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-21 14:18:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss AMQ  Via RHSA-2024:2945 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2945](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2945)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2253952#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-24 01:38:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHOSS-1.33-RHEL-8  Via RHSA-2024:4057 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4057](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4057)   ``` |  |
