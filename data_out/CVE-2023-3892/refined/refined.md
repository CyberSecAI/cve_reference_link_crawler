- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize XML data embedded within DICOM RT object tags, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability (CWE-611). The software parses XML from untrusted sources without proper sanitization leading to possible disclosure of data or other attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this XXE vulnerability to potentially access sensitive information, cause denial of service, or perform other malicious activities by embedding a crafted XML document.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves embedding a malicious XML document into specific 3rd party private RT object metadata tags within DICOM objects, then transferring this compromised DICOM object to the vulnerable MIM software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious XML document, embed it into DICOM object tags, transfer these files to the MIM system, and trigger the software to process this data, either via automated processes or by user action.
