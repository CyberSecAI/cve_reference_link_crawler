The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence, and it includes details for CVE-2021-44416.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. Specifically, the code assumes that the "param" field in a JSON command will always be a JSON object. When this field is a string (or other non-object JSON type), the program attempts to access it using the subscription operator, leading to an assertion failure, causing the process to crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `cgiserver.cgi` process does not validate the type of JSON elements before accessing them via the subscription operator. Specifically, the 'param' field for the 'Disconnect' command is not validated before being used. This can cause the process to crash if 'param' is not a JSON object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. The `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes, and, as it is responsible for heartbeats, the device reboots.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the device's API. The request body includes a JSON array containing a command with a 'param' field that is a string instead of a JSON object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This may require network access to the device. While some of the vulnerabilities described require a logged-in user, this specific vulnerability can be exploited without authentication if combined with a separate vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420), enabling unauthenticated access to API calls.

**CVE-2021-44416 Details:**
Specifically for CVE-2021-44416, the "Disconnect" command is targeted. A request such as:

```
[
    {
        "cmd": "Disconnect",
        "action": 0,
        "param":  ""
    }
]
```

will trigger the vulnerability, causing the device to reboot.
