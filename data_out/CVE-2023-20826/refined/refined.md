- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `cta` component, specifically a missing permission check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Missing permission check leading to a potential information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure, meaning an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation, meaning the attacker needs to be running code on the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system, but no additional execution privileges are needed. User interaction is not required.
