- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient authorization enforcement in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is due to inadequate checks on user permissions, allowing an attacker to modify data they should not have access to. This is a CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an authenticated remote attacker to change specific data within the web interface, even if their user role should not have permission to make such changes.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have network access to the Cisco Catalyst Center web interface.
