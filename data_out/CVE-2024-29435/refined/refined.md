- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of sanitization of the `processId` parameter when calling the `kill` command, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary system commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `processId` parameter when the system calls the `kill` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the `processId` parameter passed to the system's `kill` command.
