Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official PaulPrinting (v2018) cms
web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to
compromise browser
to web-application requests from the application-side.

The first vulnerability is located in the register module. Remote attackers are able to register user account with
malicious script code.
After the registration to attacker provokes an execution of the malformed scripts on review of the settings or by user
reviews of admins
in the backend (listing).

The second vulnerability is located in the delivery module. Remote attackers with low privileged user accounts are able
to inject own
malicious script code to contact details. Thus allows to perform an execute on each interaction with users or by
reviews of admins in
the backend (listing).

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to
malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /printing/register
[+] /account/delivery

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] First name
[+] Last name
[+] Address
[+] City
[+] State

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] firstname
[+] lastname
[+] address
[+] city
[+] state

Affected Module(s):
[+] Frontend Settings (./printing/account/setting)
[+] Frontend Delivery Address (./printing/account/delivery)
[+] Backend User Preview Listing
[+] Backend Delivery Address Contact Review

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user
account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to
continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open your browser and start a http session tamper
2. Register in the application by login click to register
3. Inject to the marked vulnerable input fields your test payload
4. Save the entry by submit via post method
5. Login to the account and preview the settings
Note: Administrators in the backend have the same wrong validated context that executes on preview of users
6. The script code executes on preview of the profile - settings
7. Successful reproduce of the first vulnerability!
8. Followup by opening the Delivery address module
9. Add a contact and add in the same vulnerable marked input fields your test payload
Note: T he script code executes on each review of the address in the backend or user frontend
10. Successful reproduce of the second vulnerability!

| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability was found in [PaulPrinting CMS 2018](?product.paulprinting:cms) ([Content Management System](?type.content_management_system)). It has been rated as problematic. Affected by this issue is some unknown processing. The manipulation of the argument `firstname/lastname/address/city/state` with an unknown input leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to [CWE-79](?vulnerability_cwe.235052 "Cwe"). The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. Impacted is integrity.

The weakness was disclosed 07/20/2023. The advisory is shared for download at [vulnerability-lab.com](?advisory_url.235052). This vulnerability is handled as [CVE-2023-3785](?source_cve.235052 "Cve"). Successful exploitation requires user interaction by the victim. Technical details as well as a public exploit are known. The MITRE ATT&CK project declares the attack technique as [T1059.007](?vulnerability_attck.235052 "Attck").

The exploit is available at [seclists.org](?exploit_url.235052). It is declared as proof-of-concept.

There is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.

The entries [VDB-288870](?id.288870), [VDB-288907](?id.288907), [VDB-288909](?id.288909) and [VDB-289117](?id.289117) are pretty similar.
