I. Background
pfSense® software is a free network firewall distribution based on the
FreeBSD operating system. The pfSense software distribution includes third-
party free software packages for additional functionality, and provides most of
the functionality of common commercial firewalls.
pfSense® Plus is the productized version of pfSense software from Netgate®,
previously referred to as pfSense Factory Edition (FE). It is available to
Netgate appliance and CSP customers.
The majority of users of pfSense software have never installed or used a stock
FreeBSD system. Unlike similar GNU/Linux-based firewall distributions, there
is no need for any UNIX knowledge. The command line is never used, and there
is no need to ever manually edit any rule sets. Instead, pfSense software
includes a web interface for the configuration of all included components.
Users familiar with commercial firewalls will quickly understand the web
interface, while those unfamiliar with commercial-grade firewalls may encounter
a short learning curve.
II. Problem Description
The vpn\_openvpn\_server.php and vpn\_openvpn\_client.php pages in the pfSense Plus
and pfSense CE software GUI did not properly validate user input passed via the
data\_ciphers parameter in certain cases. This problems is present on pfSense
Plus version 21.05.2, pfSense CE version 2.5.2, and earlier versions of both.
When the client or server mode was set to p2p\_shared\_key, the GUI did not
validate user input in the data\_ciphers parameter but the backend code still
included the value of data\_ciphers in the OpenVPN configuration. By passing
carefully crafted data including parameters which allow OpenVPN to execute
scripts, an attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands and read or write
arbitrary files.
NOTE: The Custom Options field on OpenVPN client and server configuration pages
also allows this type of action intentionally, but that field has a separate
privilege which can limit access to prevent users from altering its contents.
III. Impact
An authenticated attacker with access the to affected page, even without access
to the Custom Options field, could execute arbitrary shell commands, perform
privilege escalation, information disclosure, denial of service, or other
negative outcomes.
IV. Workaround
To help mitigate the problem on older releases, use one or more of the
following:
\* Limit access to the affected pages to trusted administrators only.
V. Solution
Users can upgrade to pfSense Plus software version 22.01 or later when
available, or pfSense CE software version 2.6.0 or later. This upgrade may be
performed in the web interface or from the console.
See https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/upgrade-guide.html
Users on pfSense Plus version 21.05.2 or pfSense pfSense CE version 2.5.2 may
apply the fix from the recommended patches list in the System Patches package.
Users may also manually apply the relevant revisions below using the System
Patches package on pfSense pfSense Plus version 21.05.2 or pfSense CE version
2.5.2 and possibly on earlier versions.
