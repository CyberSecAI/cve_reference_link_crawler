{
  "CVE-2024-36968": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `l2cap_le_flowctl_init()` function could cause a divide-by-zero error or an integer overflow because `hdev->le_mtu` may not be within the valid range.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Divide-by-zero error",
        "Integer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause a kernel panic, leading to a denial of service.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the establishment of a Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) connection, specifically within the `l2cap_le_flowctl_init()` function.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to initiate a Bluetooth LE connection to trigger the vulnerable code."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) value was not properly validated before being used in the `l2cap_le_flowctl_init` function, leading to potential division by zero or integer overflow errors.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Improper input validation of MTU values",
        "Potential division by zero",
        "Potential integer overflow"
      ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to a kernel panic and a denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "By initiating a crafted Bluetooth LE connection with an invalid MTU.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate a Bluetooth LE connection to trigger this vulnerability."
