Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure access to user token data in MFASOFT Secure Authentication Server. Specifically, the `/api-selfportal/get-info-token-properties` endpoint allows access to user token information without proper authentication.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **IDOR:** The system does not properly validate the user's authorization to access the requested resource (user token data).
*   **Lack of Authentication:** Access to sensitive token information is possible without any authentication.
*   **Brute-forceable parameter:** The "serial" parameter used to retrieve token information is susceptible to brute-force attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user token data. This could potentially lead to further unauthorized access and compromise of user accounts/systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the vulnerable MFASOFT Secure Authentication Server can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Brute-Force:** By iteratively submitting requests with different values for the "serial" parameter to `/api-selfportal/get-info-token-properties`, an attacker can discover and retrieve user token information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network connectivity to the MFASOFT Secure Authentication Server
*   Ability to make HTTP requests.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/api-selfportal/get-info-token-properties`) and the parameter (`serial`).

**Affected Versions:**
*   MFASOFT Secure Authentication Server versions 1.8.x through 1.9.x before 1.9.040924
