Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a missing size check when handling large input shapes and rates in the `tf.random.gamma` and `tf.random.poisson` functions in TensorFlow. When these functions receive exceedingly large output shapes, a check failure occurs, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Missing Size Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper validation to prevent excessively large shape and rates values when generating random numbers.
-   **`CHECK` Fail:** The lack of validation results in a `CHECK` failure. This can crash the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a DoS by providing input values that result in large output shapes, causing the application to crash due to the `CHECK` failure.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Input manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting specific input shapes and rate tensors for `tf.random.gamma` or `tf.random.poisson` that cause the size calculation to overflow, which leads to the check failure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to `tf.random.gamma` or `tf.random.poisson`. This could be done by providing values for the `shape`, `alpha`, and/or `beta`/`lam` parameters.

**Additional details:**

* The fix involved using `AppendShapeWithStatus` which checks the size and avoids the overflow during shape appending.
* The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0 and was patched in 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
* The provided code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
* Tests were added to catch similar issues in the future.
* The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity, but it is a denial of service vulnerability.
