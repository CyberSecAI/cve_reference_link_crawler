SUMMARY

The SCALANCE W1750D device contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to inject
commands or exploit buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities which could lead to denial of service, unauthenticated
remote code execution or stored XSS.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE W1750D is an Access Point that supports IEEE 802.11ac standards for high-performance
WLAN, and is equipped with two dual-band radios, which can provide access and monitor the network
simultaneously.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2002-20001

The Difﬁe-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send
arbitrary numbers that are actually not public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-
exponentiation calculations, aka a D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and
network bandwidth. The attack may be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to
select its largest supported key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can
only communicate with DHE, and the server must be conﬁgured to allow DHE. (ATLWL-266)
