- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection vulnerability within the command line interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the command line interface to be able to exploit the vulnerability.
