May 27, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 7.5.0

## Patched versions

7.6.0

## Description

### Impact

Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to read and delete files and folders from an arbitrary, writable directory as anyone can set the output folder when submitting the request via the `outputFolder` option.

### Patches

The issue was fixed via [#18652](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/18652) (included in v7.6.0 release) by removing the usage of the `outputFolder` option.

### Workarounds

No workaround available.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID

Skip setting output folder in online service to avoid users providing output folder with `../../` for example to access other folders.

### PR checklist

* Read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Pull Request title clearly describes the work in the pull request and Pull Request description provides details about how to validate the work. Missing information here may result in delayed response from the community.
* Run the following to [build the project](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#14---build-projects) and update samples:
  ```
  ./mvnw clean package
  ./bin/generate-samples.sh ./bin/configs/*.yaml
  ./bin/utils/export_docs_generators.sh

  ```

  (For Windows users, please run the script in [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/))

  Commit all changed files.

  This is important, as CI jobs will verify *all* generator outputs of your HEAD commit as it would merge with master.

  These must match the expectations made by your contribution.

  You may regenerate an individual generator by passing the relevant config(s) as an argument to the script, for example `./bin/generate-samples.sh bin/configs/java*`.

  IMPORTANT: Do **NOT** purge/delete any folders/files (e.g. tests) when regenerating the samples as manually written tests may be removed.
* File the PR against the [correct branch](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/wiki/Git-Branches): `master` (upcoming 7.1.0 minor release - breaking changes with fallbacks), `8.0.x` (breaking changes without fallbacks)
* If your PR is targeting a particular programming language, @mention the [technical committee](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/#62---openapi-generator-technical-committee) members, so they are more likely to review the pull request.

Sorry, something went wrong.
