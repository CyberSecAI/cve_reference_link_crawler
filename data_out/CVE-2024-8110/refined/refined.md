- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked return value (CWE-252) related to the handling of UDP broadcast packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly handle a large number of UDP broadcast packets, leading to a potential restart of the affected computer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If a computer running the affected software receives a large number of UDP broadcast packets in a short time, it may restart. If both the active and standby computers restart simultaneously, the functionality on that computer may be temporarily unavailable, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a large number of UDP broadcast packets to the affected computer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send UDP broadcast packets to the affected computer; no special privileges are required.
