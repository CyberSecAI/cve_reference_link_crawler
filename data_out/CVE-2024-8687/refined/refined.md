- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An information exposure vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software allows a GlobalProtect end user to discover the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the disable/disconnect passcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a cleartext exposure of sensitive information (passwords/passcodes) to an unauthorized control sphere (the end-user). Specifically, the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password, and the disconnect/disable passcodes can be accessed by an end-user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation enables end users to bypass intended restrictions and uninstall, disable, or disconnect the GlobalProtect app even when such actions are normally prohibited. This can lead to the circumvention of security policies and potential exposure of the network.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to an endpoint running the GlobalProtect app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a legitimate end-user of a system with the vulnerable GlobalProtect app installed. No special privileges are needed on the local system beyond being a standard end-user.
