{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The MediaTek vcodec driver was calling `mtk_vcodec_mem_free()` without checking if the buffer to be freed actually exists (i.e., if the buffer's virtual address `va` is not NULL).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper null check before freeing memory"
    ],
    "impact": "Attempting to free a NULL address can lead to a kernel crash or other undefined behavior, potentially causing denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation would likely involve manipulating the video decoding/encoding process to trigger the freeing of non-existent buffers.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger video encoding/decoding operations and possibly influence memory allocation patterns to reach the vulnerable code path."
