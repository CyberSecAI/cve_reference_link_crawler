{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `scniro-validator` package is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to its inefficient handling of long, invalid email addresses.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The validator's algorithm exhibits a performance issue when processing extremely long, invalid email addresses, leading to excessive resource consumption.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending crafted, invalid email addresses to be validated, potentially making the application or service using this validator unavailable. The vulnerability allows for resource exhaustion via a loop that increases the validation time as the length of the input increases.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, involving the submission of specially crafted, long strings to the `validate` function of the vulnerable package.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not require any special privileges. The only requirement is the ability to send input data to the service using the vulnerable package, specifically to the validation function."
