Root cause of vulnerability: The WordPress Open Graph Metabox Plugin <= 1.4.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Impact of exploitation: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploitable through a CSRF attack. An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, will perform an action in the context of that user's session.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to trigger a crafted malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim user does.
