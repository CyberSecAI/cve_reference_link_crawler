- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to brute-force the WPS PIN on the MR2600 router.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the insufficient protection against WPS PIN brute-forcing, allowing unauthorized access through this method.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability grants an attacker unauthorized access to the wireless network.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker within the wireless range of the vulnerable router can attempt to brute-force the WPS pin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within the wireless range of the targeted MR2600 router.
