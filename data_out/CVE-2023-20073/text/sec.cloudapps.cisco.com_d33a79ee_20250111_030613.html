This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement mechanisms in the context of file uploads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload arbitrary files to the affected device.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-afu-EXxwA65V>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers if they were running firmware Release 1.0.03.29 or earlier:    + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit POE VPN Routers See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators can disable the affected component of the web-based management interface by logging in to the device and disabling the **RESTCONF** option under **Firewall** > **Basic Settings**.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers have entered the end-of-life process.
