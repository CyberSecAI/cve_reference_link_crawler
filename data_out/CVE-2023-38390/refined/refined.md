- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the website while authenticated. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available through the vulnerable plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website or email, where a user is tricked into unknowingly submitting a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site while authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering the malicious request. The attacker does not need to have any prior access or privileges on the targeted WordPress site.
