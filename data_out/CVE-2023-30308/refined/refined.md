The provided content discusses a vulnerability related to TCP hijacking in NAT-enabled Wi-Fi networks, which seems relevant to CVE-2023-30308. The details include:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A side-channel vulnerability in NAT port preservation strategy
- Insufficient reverse path validation in Wi-Fi routers
- Routers disabling TCP window tracking strategy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NAT port preservation allows inference of TCP connections.
- Insufficient reverse path validation enables off-path attacks.
- Disabling TCP window tracking allows manipulation of TCP connections.
- Routers are susceptible to eviction of original NAT mapping by fake TCP packets.
- Lack of proper TCP state tracking

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can infer the presence of TCP connections between a victim client and a server.
- Intercept TCP packets from the server.
- Obtain the current sequence and acknowledgment numbers.
- Forcefully close TCP connections.
- Poison traffic by injecting fake packets.
- Reroute the server's incoming packets to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Off-path attacker.
- Sending fake TCP packets to exploit NAT mapping and TCP window tracking issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on a different network segment but able to interact with the target Wi-Fi network (e.g., by being in the same area but not necessarily connected to the same access point).
- The ability to send forged TCP packets.
- Knowledge of how NAT port preservation and TCP works on Wi-Fi routers.

**Additional Details:**
-  The research tested 67 widely used routers from 30 vendors, with 52 affected.
-  75 out of 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks tested (81%) are vulnerable.
- Average time to terminate an SSH connection is about 17.5 seconds.
- Average time to download files from FTP servers is about 19.4 seconds.
- Average time to inject fake HTTP responses is about 54.5 seconds.
- Success rates of exploitation are 87.4%, 82.6%, and 76.1% respectively.
