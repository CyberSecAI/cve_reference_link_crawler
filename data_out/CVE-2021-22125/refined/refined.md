- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements in FortiSandbox's sniffer module. This allows an authenticated administrator to inject and execute commands on the underlying system's shell by altering the content of its configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated administrator can alter the content of the sniffer module's configuration file to inject malicious commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated administrator of the FortiSandbox appliance.
