Unless other marked, all fields# are \*REQUIRED\*.# Unless otherwise specified, these keys CANNOT be hot-reloaded.homeserver: # The URL to the home server for client-server API calls, also used to form the # media URLs as displayed in bridged IRC channels: url: "http://localhost:8008" # # The URL of the homeserver hosting media files. This is only used to transform # mxc URIs to http URIs when bridging m.room.[file|image] events. Optional. By # default, this is the homeserver URL, specified above. # This key CAN be hot-reloaded. # media\_url: "http://media.repo:8008"
 # Drop Matrix messages which are older than this number of seconds, according to # the event's origin\_server\_ts. # If the bridge is down for a while, the homeserver will attempt to send all missed # events on reconnection. These events may be hours old, which can be confusing to # IRC users if they are then bridged. This option allows these old messages to be # dropped. # CAUTION: This is a very coarse heuristic. Federated homeservers may have different # clock times and hence produce different origin\_server\_ts values, which may be old # enough to cause \*all\* events from the homeserver to be dropped. # Default: 0 (don't ever drop) # This key CAN be hot-reloaded. # dropMatrixMessagesAfterSecs: 300 # 5 minutes
 # The 'domain' part for user IDs on this home server. Usually (but not always) # is the "domain name" part of the HS URL. domain: "localhost"

 # Which port should the appservice bind to. Can be overriden by the one provided in the # command line! Optional. # bindPort: 8090
 # Use this option to force the appservice to listen on another hostname for transactions. # This is NOT your synapse hostname. E.g. use 127.0.0.1 to only listen locally. Optional. # bindHostname: 0.0.0.0
# Configuration specific to the IRC serviceircService: # All server keys can be hot-reloaded, however existing IRC connections # will not have changes applied to them. servers: # The address of the server to connect to. irc.example.com: # A human-readable short name. This is used to label IRC status rooms # where matrix users control their connections. # E.g. 'ExampleNet IRC Bridge status'. # It is also used in the Third Party Lookup API as the instance `desc` # property, where each server is an instance. name: "ExampleNet" # Additional addresses to connect to, used for load balancing between IRCDs. additionalAddresses: [ "irc2.example.com" ] # Typically additionalAddresses would be in addition to the address key given above, # but some configurations wish to exclusively use additional addresses while reserving # the top key for identification purposes. Set this to true to exclusively use the # additionalAddresses array when connecting to servers. onlyAdditionalAddresses: false # # [DEPRECATED] Use `name`, above, instead. # A human-readable description string # description: "Example.com IRC network"
 # An ID for uniquely identifying this server amongst other servers being bridged. # networkId: "example"
 # MXC URL to an icon used as the network icon whenever this network appear in # a network list. (Like in the Element room directory, for instance.) # icon: mxc://matrix.org/LpsSLrbANVrEIEOgEaVteItf
 # The port to connect to. Optional. port: 6697 # Whether to use SSL or not.

 quitDebounce: # Whether parts due to net-splits are debounced for delayMs, to allow # time for the netsplit to resolve itself. A netsplit is detected as being # a QUIT rate higher than quitsPerSecond. Default: false. enabled: false # The maximum number of quits per second acceptable above which a netsplit is # considered ongoing. Default: 5. quitsPerSecond: 5 # The time window in which to wait before bridging a QUIT to Matrix that occurred during # a netsplit. Debouncing is jittered randomly between delayMinMs and delayMaxMs so that the HS # is not sent many requests to leave rooms all at once if a netsplit occurs and many # people to not rejoin. # If the user with the same IRC nick as the one who sent the quit rejoins a channel # they are considered back online and the quit is not bridged, so long as the rejoin # occurs before the randomly-jittered timeout is not reached. # Default: 3600000, = 1h delayMinMs: 3600000 # 1h # Default: 7200000, = 2h delayMaxMs: 7200000 # 2h
 # A map for conversion of IRC user modes to Matrix power levels. This enables bridging # of IRC ops to Matrix power levels only, it does not enable the reverse. If a user has # been given multiple modes, the one that maps to the highest power level will be used. modePowerMap: o: 50 v: 1
 botConfig: # Enable the presence of the bot in IRC channels. The bot serves as the entity # which maps from IRC -> Matrix. You can disable the bot entirely which # means IRC -> Matrix chat will be shared by active "M-Nick" connections # in the room. If there are no users in the room (or if there are users # but their connections are not on IRC) then nothing will be bridged to # Matrix. If you're concerned about the bot being treated as a "logger" # entity, then you may want to disable the bot. If you want IRC->Matrix # but don't want to have TCP connections to IRC unless a Matrix user speaks # (because your client connection limit is low), then you may want to keep # the bot enabled. Default: true. # NB: If the bot is disabled, you SHOULD have matrix-to-IRC syncing turned # on, else there will be no users and no bot in a channel (meaning no # messages to Matrix!) until a Matrix user speaks which makes a client # join the target IRC channel. # NBB: The bridge bot IRC client will still join the target IRC network so # it can service bridge-specific queries from the IRC-side e.g. so # real IRC clients have a way to change their Matrix display name. # See https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/55 enabled: true # The nickname to give the AS bot. nick: "MatrixBot" # The username to give to the AS bot.

If not specified, all users will connect from the same # (default) address. This may require additional OS-specific work to allow # for the node process to bind to multiple different source addresses # Linux kernels 4.3+ support sysctl net.ipv6.ip\_nonlocal\_bind=1 # Older kernels will need IP\_FREEBIND, which requires an LD\_PRELOAD with the library # https://github.com/matrix-org/freebindfree as Node does not expose setsockopt. # prefix: "2001:0db8:85a3::" # modify appropriately
 # Optional. Define blocks of IPv6 addresses for different homeservers # which can be used to restrict users of those homeservers to a given # IP. These blocks should be considered immutable once set, as changing # the startFrom value will NOT adjust existing IP addresses. # Changing the startFrom value to a lower value may conflict with existing clients. # Multiple homeservers may NOT share blocks. blocks: - homeserver: another-server.org startFrom: '10:0000' # # The maximum amount of time in seconds that the client can exist # without sending another message before being disconnected.

Default: 172800 (48 hours) idleTimeout: 10800 # The number of millseconds to wait between consecutive reconnections if a # client gets disconnected.

You should set this to a reasonably high number so that # bridges are not waiting an eternity to reconnect all its clients if # we see a massive number of disconnect. This is unrelated to the reconnectIntervalMs # setting above which is for connecting on restart of the bridge. Set to 0 to # immediately try to reconnect all users. # Default: 50 concurrentReconnectLimit: 50 # The number of lines to allow being sent by the IRC client that has received # a large block of text to send from matrix. If the number of lines that would # be sent is > lineLimit, the text will instead be uploaded to matrix and the # resulting URI is treated as a file. As such, a link will be sent to the IRC # side instead of potentially spamming IRC and getting the IRC client kicked. # Default: 3. lineLimit: 3 # A list of user modes to set on every IRC client. For example, "RiG" would set # +R, +i and +G on every IRC connection when they have successfully connected. # User modes vary wildly depending on the IRC network you're connecting to, # so check before setting this value.
