# Malicious Matrix homeserver can leak truncated message content of messages it shouldn't have access to

Low

GHSA-w9mh-5x8j-9754
Jul 4, 2024

## Package

npm

matrix-appservice-irc
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 2.0.0

## Patched versions

2.0.1

## Description

### Impact

The fix for [GHSA-wm4w-7h2q-3pf7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wm4w-7h2q-3pf7 "GHSA-wm4w-7h2q-3pf7") / [CVE-2024-32000](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32000) included in matrix-appservice-irc 2.0.0 relied on the Matrix homeserver-provided timestamp to determine whether a user has access to the event they're replying to when determining whether or not to include a truncated version of the original event in the IRC message. Since this value is controlled by external entities, a malicious Matrix homeserver joined to a room in which a matrix-appservice-irc bridge instance (before version 2.0.1) is present can fabricate the timestamp with the intent of tricking the bridge into leaking room messages the homeserver should not have access to.

### Patches

matrix-appservice-irc 2.0.1 [drops the reliance](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1804) on `origin_server_ts` when determining whether or not an event should be visible to a user, instead tracking the event timestamps internally.

### Workarounds

It's possible to limit the amount of information leaked by setting a reply template that doesn't contain the original message. See [these lines](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/d5d67d1d3ea3f0f6962a0af2cc57b56af3ad2129/config.sample.yaml#L601-L604) in the configuration file.
