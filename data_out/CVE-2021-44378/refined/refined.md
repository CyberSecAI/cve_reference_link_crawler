This document provides details for CVE-2021-44378 and related vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is improper input validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser of the Reolink RLC-410W camera. The code assumes that the `param` JSON element is always an object and attempts to access its members using the subscription operator. When a non-object value (like an empty string) is provided for `param`, an assertion is triggered, leading to the termination of the `cgiserver.cgi` process and a device reboot.

**Vulnerabilities:**
  - **CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the type of the JSON element provided as "param" before accessing its members, leading to an assertion failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service condition by crashing the `cgiserver.cgi` process, causing the device to reboot. This can disrupt the camera's functionality and make it temporarily unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP Request with Malformed JSON:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request containing a JSON array with a command and an invalid (non-object) `param` value.
  - The request is sent to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera's web server.
    -  While some of the API calls require a logged-in user, it is stated that CVE-2021-44378 can be exploited without authentication by using TALOS-2021-1420.
  - **Knowledge of API Commands:** The attacker needs to know the API command names (e.g., "SetEnc") that are vulnerable to this issue.

**Specific Details for CVE-2021-44378:**
- The specific vulnerability is in the `SetEnc` command's parameter parser.
- The `param` value should be a JSON object, but if an empty string `""` is provided the device crashes.
- Payload:
```json
[
    {
        "cmd": "SetEnc",
        "action": 0,
        "param":  ""
    }
]
```
