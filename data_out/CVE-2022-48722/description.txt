In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ieee802154: ca8210: Stop leaking skb's

Upon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called. Only
ieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. We then leak the skb
structure.

Free the skb structure upon error before returning.
