The provided content is related to a commit in the `zenml-io/zenml` repository that addresses an "activation vulnerability" and introduces admin users. This commit includes several changes related to user management, permissions, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The commit message `close activation vulnerability` suggests that there was a flaw in how user accounts were being activated or managed, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. The specific nature of the activation vulnerability is not explicitly stated but implied to be related to the new admin user functionality.
- The code changes reveal that previously, users could be created without a password and be active, but now this is being changed and the user must be active if they are not a REST user

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability appears to be related to the activation process and potentially how user permissions are handled. The commit introduces the concept of "admin" users, and the fix includes a mechanism to verify admin permissions in endpoints, preventing unauthorized access.
- The original issue allowed creation of users without a password and them being active.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Without the fix, an attacker could potentially exploit the activation vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the system or escalate their privileges to become an administrator.
- Since the specifics of the exploit aren't available, we can assume it could result in the attacker being able to view, modify, or delete sensitive data or configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers could potentially create users without passwords and become active on systems that were not using the REST API, allowing them to have access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have some level of access to the system or API to create user accounts.
- The ability to interact with the user creation mechanism would be necessary to exploit the activation vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   **User Management Changes:** The commit introduces the concept of admin users and adds functionality for creating, updating, and listing users with admin privileges via CLI.
*   **RBAC Implementation:** The changes verify admin permissions in API endpoints, likely to protect sensitive admin-only functions.
*   **Migration:** The update includes a migration to transition existing users to admin users if they meet certain criteria.
*   **Model Changes:** The commit modifies user models to include an `is_admin` field.
*  **CLI Updates:** The user management CLI now has new options to specify if a user should be an admin and can change existing users to have admin privileges.
* **Edge Cases:** The commit also seems to handle various edge cases, such as missing arguments and confirmation prompts before demoting an admin user.
* **Testing:** The commit includes changes to tests that run on rest to accommodate the changes to user creation.

**Summary:**
This commit addresses a vulnerability related to user activation, likely involving improper handling of user permissions, specifically for non-REST users. It also introduces the concept of admin users and adds relevant user management features. The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to create user accounts and gain unauthorized access or escalate their privileges to administrator level. The fix adds checks to verify admin permissions in the system endpoints and modifies user models and CLI to incorporate the new admin functionality.
