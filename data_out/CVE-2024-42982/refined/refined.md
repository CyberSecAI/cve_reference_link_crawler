{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fromVirtualSer` function in Tenda FH1206 firmware uses `sprintf` to copy a user-supplied `page` parameter into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to the `/goform/VirtualSer` endpoint with an overly long `page` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device's web interface. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement in the provided content."
