Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from a mismatch in pattern matching between Spring Security and Spring WebFlux when using `"**"` (double wildcard) as a pattern in Spring Security configurations for WebFlux.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Bypass:** The core issue is a potential security bypass due to the inconsistent interpretation of the double wildcard pattern (`"**"`) between the two frameworks. Spring Security and Spring WebFlux handle this pattern differently, which can lead to requests that should be secured being allowed to pass through.
- **Mismatched Pattern Matching:** The root cause is the different pattern matching logic between Spring Security and Spring WebFlux with respect to double wildcard pattern.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information could be exposed.
- **Data Modification/Addition:** Attackers might be able to add or modify data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could potentially lead to denial of service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) as the vulnerability is exploitable through network requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers (PR:N), meaning they don't need valid credentials to exploit it.
- **Low Complexity:** Exploitation is of low complexity (AC:L)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to applications using Spring Security with WebFlux and configuring security rules using the double wildcard pattern `"**"`.
- The provided NetApp content indicates that none of their products are affected by this vulnerability, but they provide information as they utilize Spring Security and are tracking the issue.
- The Spring Security advisory provides specific affected versions and the fixed versions.
- The severity of this vulnerability is considered HIGH.
