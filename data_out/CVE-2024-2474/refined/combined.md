### Description

The Standout Color Boxes and Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'color-button' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.7.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

The main thing I wanted to do was add some color behind titles or quotes on a page to make them pop out. It took a few minutes to pick it up to modify it some, but this will be a new tool i my belt. My tips is when using custom box colors and centered and bold text to use the short code below.
[color-box customcolorpicker=”#243163″]
<p style=”text-align: center;”><span style=”color: #ffffff; font-size: 18pt;”>Your Text</span></p>
[/color-box]
