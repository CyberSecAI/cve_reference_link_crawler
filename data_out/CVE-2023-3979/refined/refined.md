The content is related to a vulnerability in GitLab that allows a removed developer to continue editing the source code of a public project.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the interaction between forking, merge request collaboration, and access control settings in GitLab. Specifically, a user can create a merge request from a public project to a fork of the project, with the "collaboration" feature enabled. Even after being removed from the original project, the user retains write access via the open merge request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inconsistent access control:** The "collaboration" feature on merge requests allows users to retain write access to the source project even after being removed from the project's member list.
    *   **Visibility Issues:** The project owner can't see or delete the merge requests created on the fork, making it difficult to discover and stop the malicious activity.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized code modification:** A removed developer can continue to modify the code of the original project by pushing changes to the source branch of the open merge request. This can lead to backdoors, data corruption, or other malicious activity, even after their access was revoked.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a developer of a public project.
    *   The attacker creates a fork of the project.
    *   The attacker configures the fork to limit merge request visibility to project members.
    *   The attacker creates merge requests from non-protected branches of the public project to corresponding branches in the fork, with the collaboration option enabled.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Must be a developer of the public project
    *   Must have the ability to fork the project
    *   Must have ability to change settings of the fork.
