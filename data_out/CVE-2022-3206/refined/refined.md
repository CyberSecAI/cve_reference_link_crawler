- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin stores the password in a cookie named "passster" using base64 encoding, which is easily decodable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure storage of sensitive information (passwords) using weak encoding (base64).
- **Impact of exploitation**: If the cookies are leaked, the password can be easily extracted, potentially leading to unauthorized access to protected content.
- **Attack vectors**: Cookie leakage through various means (e.g., network sniffing, malicious browser extensions, cross-site scripting).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to obtain the "passster" cookie value, either through access to the user's browser or by intercepting network traffic. No specific user interaction is required beyond the normal usage of the website.
