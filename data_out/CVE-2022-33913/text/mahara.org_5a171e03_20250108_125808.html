## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

#### **Critical**

**We recommend you install this security update on your site as quickly as possible.**

Vulnerability type: Incorrect access control
Attack type: Remote
Impact: Information disclosure

Unsupported versions of Mahara 20.04 and 20.10, and support versions of Mahara 21.04 before 21.04.6, 21.10 before 21.10.4, and 22.04.2 are vulnerable to files being served by thumb.php without a permission check under certain conditions.

Reported by Gwenole T.
[Bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/%2Bbug/1978520)
CVE reference: [CVE 2022-33913](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2022-33913)

#### Which versions of Mahara are fixed?

**Mahara 21.04, 21.10, and 22.04 are currently supported for security fixes.** You can download the latest minor point versions 21.04.6, 21.10.4, and 22.04.2 respectively to receive the fix for this security issue.

**Mahara 20.04 and 20.10 are not supported with security fixes** any more. However, you can patch your site by backporting the fix to your instance, i.e. [download the two changed files](https://reviews.mahara.org/c/mahara/%2B/12903) (or [download a patch file](https://git.mahara.org/mahara/mahara/-/commit/73789944591d60d3ac35ef680a8ec9f209bdd63c)) and merge them into your codebase. You may have to resolve merge conflicts, esp. if you changed anything in these files yourself.

#### Where can I find the security releases?

You can [download the latest versions from Launchpad or check out the relevant branch from Git](https://mahara.org/download).
