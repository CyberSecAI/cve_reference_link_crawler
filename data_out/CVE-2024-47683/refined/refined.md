Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing check in the `is_dsc_need_re_compute` function within the AMD display driver (amdgpu). The function was not correctly handling cases where there was no stream on the link, leading to a null pointer dereference when trying to access stream data. This occurs during MST (Multi-Stream Transport) + DSC (Display Stream Compression) setup.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:**  The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. When `new_stream_on_link_num` is zero, the code does not properly skip recomputing DSC parameters, leading to access of memory at address 0x0000000000000008, which is invalid and results in a kernel crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic/Crash:** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a kernel panic and system crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through specific display configurations involving MST and DSC. The user would need to set up a display configuration that involves Multi-Stream Transport (MST) and Display Stream Compression (DSC) which leads to a condition that new_stream_on_link_num is zero. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position where they can control the display configuration, which is typically done through software controlling the display output. No specific privilege is mentioned but controlling the display configuration is a privileged operation.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided patches address the issue by adding a check at the beginning of the `is_dsc_need_re_compute` function.  If `new_stream_on_link_num` is 0, the function will return false, skipping DSC recomputation and preventing the null pointer dereference.

The patches include the following line:
```c
if (new_stream_on_link_num == 0)
	return false;
```
This check ensures that the function will skip further processing if there's no stream on the link, thus preventing the null pointer dereference.
