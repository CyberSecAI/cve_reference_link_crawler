- **Website Defacement:** Malicious scripts can be used to alter the appearance and functionality of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious scripts into the attributes of the Filterable Gallery and Interactive Circle widgets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Access to Widget Settings:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the settings of the affected widgets.
