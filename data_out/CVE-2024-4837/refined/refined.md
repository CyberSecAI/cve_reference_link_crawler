- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A trust boundary violation vulnerability in Telerik Report Server allows an unauthenticated attacker to access restricted functionality by exploiting the way the server stores and accesses application settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200) due to a trust boundary violation. The application's settings storage mechanism, when misconfigured to use an external option, can expose sensitive data like plain text credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can interfere with the Report Server's operation by accessing and corrupting application settings, including potentially sensitive information like plain text credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through network access to the Report Server on IIS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the Telerik Report Server running on IIS. No prior authentication is required. The attacker must also be able to identify a misconfigured server using an external storage option.
