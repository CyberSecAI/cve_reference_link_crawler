Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Grafana's datasource query caching mechanism. When enabled, Grafana caches all headers, including the `Set-Cookie` header, which is used to manage Grafana session cookies. Crucially, when a session cookie is rotated (using `Set-Cookie grafana_session` header), the new session cookie is also cached.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Caching of Sensitive Information:** The core weakness is that Grafana caches sensitive session cookies along with other headers when datasource query caching is enabled. This leads to a potential for session hijacking.
-   **Lack of Header Sanitization:** Grafana does not sanitize or filter the headers being cached, leading to the inclusion of sensitive data (session cookies).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Session Hijacking:**  An attacker or an unauthorized user could potentially obtain another user's active session cookie from the cache. This could grant them the same privileges as that user on the system.
-   **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is the exposure of sensitive session information.
-  **Data Modification/Denial of Service (DoS):** As noted in the NetApp advisory, successful exploitation could also lead to data modification or DoS. This is a broader scope and not explicitly detailed in the provided Grafana advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker needs to send requests to the vulnerable Grafana instance.
-   **Targeted Request:** The attacker needs to make a targeted request to a specific Grafana API endpoint (e.g., `/api/datasources/134/resources/api/v1/series`) that triggers datasource query caching.
-  **Session Cookie Rotation:** The initial request must coincide with a session cookie rotation, such that a new session cookie is cached.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Access to Grafana:** The attacker needs to have access to the Grafana instance and be able to send requests.
-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only requires low privileges within the system as the vulnerability is related to the caching mechanism and not other privileged functionality.
-   **Knowledge of the Targeted Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know a vulnerable API endpoint on the Grafana instance that triggers datasource query caching.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub advisory is more detailed than the NetApp advisory concerning the steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The NetApp advisory states a higher CVSS score of 8.8 compared to the 7.1 listed in the GitHub advisory, and also notes a potential for data modification or Denial of Service, which are not detailed in the Grafana advisory.
*   The vulnerability is present in Grafana versions >=8.3.0-beta1 and patched in versions 9.3.4 and 9.2.10
*   NetApp products that incorporate Grafana may be vulnerable. However, the NetApp advisory notes that none of their products are affected by this vulnerability.
