# Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

High

[vtorosyan](/vtorosyan)
published
GHSA-2j8f-6whh-frc8
Feb 1, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>=8.3.0-beta1

## Patched versions

9.3.4, 9.2.10

## Description

## Summary

When datasource query caching is enabled, Grafana caches all headers, including when rotating the Grafana session cookie via a `Set-Cookie grafana_session` header. As a result, any user could receive the cached session cookie of someone else if the response to the first datasource query contained a session cookie rotation header.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Enable datasource query caching
2. Make a targeted request to the affected endpoint (ex: <https://localhost:3000/api/datasources/134/resources/api/v1/series>
   * The request must be done with a session cookie older than the rotation interval (default 10 minutes).
   * The response will include x-cache:MISS as a header and also the Set-Cookie header
3. The following requests to this endpoint will return this first user's new grafana session cookie during the cache lifetime, 5 minutes by default.

### Mitigations

To fully address CVE-2022-23498 please upgrade your Grafana instances. As an alternative, you could disable datasource query caching for all datasources.

### Affected Versions

Grafana Enterprise >=8.3.0-beta1

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
