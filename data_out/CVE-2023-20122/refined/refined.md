- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of parameters sent to a specific CLI command within the restricted shell of Cisco ISE.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection due to insufficient input validation in the restricted shell.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated, local attacker can escape the restricted shell and gain *root* privileges on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker logs into the device and issues a crafted CLI command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated shell user, which can be an administrative or a read-only role account.
