Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `sortKey`, `latitude`, and `longitude` parameters in the `/api/front/store/list` endpoint. These parameters are directly embedded into SQL queries using `${}` formatting without sufficient filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary weakness is the direct inclusion of user-controlled input into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server by injecting malicious SQL queries. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or potentially gain access to the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the `/api/front/store/list` endpoint by manipulating the `sortKey`, `latitude` and `longitude` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the `/api/front/store/list` endpoint of the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is seemingly required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the `sortKey`, `latitude`, and `longitude` parameters in their request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `getNearList` function, which is called when both `latitude` and `longitude` parameters are provided to `/api/front/store/list`.
- The issue is present in versions of `crmeb_java` up to and including 1.3.4.

The provided content gives more specific details about the vulnerable parameters (`sortKey`, `latitude`, and `longitude`), the affected endpoint (`/api/front/store/list`), and the vulnerable function `getNearList` than the CVE description placeholder.
