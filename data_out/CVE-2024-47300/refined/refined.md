- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CubeWP Forms plugin for WordPress versions 1.1.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data before displaying it on the website.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically, the ability to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads. When other users visit the affected pages, these malicious scripts would execute in their browsers. This could result in a variety of malicious activities, including redirecting users to phishing sites, injecting unwanted advertisements, or performing other actions in the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:**  Malicious scripts are injected into the website, which are executed when other users visit. The specific mechanism of how the scripts are injected into the forms is not described in the provided content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
