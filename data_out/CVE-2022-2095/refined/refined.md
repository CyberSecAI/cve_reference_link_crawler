{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `/autocomplete/deploy_keys_with_owners` endpoint does not properly check user permissions before retrieving deploy keys, unlike the REST API which enforces access control.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent access control enforcement between different API endpoints.",
       "Insufficient authorization checks in the autocomplete endpoint."
    ],
    "impact": "Non-project members can view deploy keys of public projects.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By sending a crafted request to the `/autocomplete/deploy_keys_with_owners` endpoint."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a GitLab user and know the project ID of the public project they are targeting."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in the autocomplete endpoint, specifically at `https://gitlab.com/-/autocomplete/deploy_keys_with_owners?project_id=[project-id]`. The REST API correctly blocks access to the deploy keys for non-members, but this endpoint does not take `current_user` into account when fetching keys."
