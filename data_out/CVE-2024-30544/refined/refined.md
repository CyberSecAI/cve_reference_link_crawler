- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any authentication or specific privileges. They can be unauthenticated and still exploit the vulnerability.
