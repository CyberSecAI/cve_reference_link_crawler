- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when handling the `ActiveCells` parameter of the `CreateRules` and `ModifyRules` APIs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of root, leading to complete control of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability. Although authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and has to bypass authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
