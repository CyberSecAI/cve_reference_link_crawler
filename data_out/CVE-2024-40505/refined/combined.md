Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
