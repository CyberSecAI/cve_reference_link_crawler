| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2244707#c0)  Robb Gatica    2023-10-17 21:57:14 UTC  ``` Reference: [http://localhost:5600/static/?#/asm_ticket/102084](http://localhost:5600/static/#/asm_ticket/102084)  Original advisory details: Jorge Sancho Larraz discovered that iperf3 did not properly manage certain inputs, which could cause the server process to stop responding, waiting for input on the control connection. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
