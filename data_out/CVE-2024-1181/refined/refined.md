Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The plugin relies on the `REQUEST_URI` to determine if a page access is within the admin area, which is not a reliable method for access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly authenticate or authorize access when the maintenance mode is active. Specifically, it only checks if the request URI matches a hardcoded list of admin paths.
*   **Insecure Access Control:** The plugin uses a flawed method to determine if a user should be subject to maintenance mode restrictions by inspecting `REQUEST_URI` instead of using the correct WordPress functions for checking login status or user roles for all requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Maintenance Mode Bypass:** Unauthenticated attackers can bypass the maintenance mode, gaining access to the website when it's supposed to be in maintenance or coming soon mode.
*   **Exposure of Confidential Content:** This bypass may expose content that is intended to be kept private during the maintenance/coming soon phase.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to have an account on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by making HTTP requests to any page on the website, provided the plugin is active and maintenance mode is enabled. Since the logic relies on `REQUEST_URI`, a request to a non-admin path will bypass the maintenance mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special permissions:** The attacker does not require any specific user role or access to the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.1.2.
*   The patched version is 2.1.3 which likely implements proper checks for user authentication and authorization in the `dazz_cs_launch` function.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as having a "Medium" severity, with a CVSS score of 5.3.
*   The provided code snippet highlights the vulnerable logic in the `dazz_cs_launch` function, where the `REQUEST_URI` is checked against a whitelist. It also shows the function is hooked to the `template_redirect` action, which is executed for all requests.
*   The fix is likely related to properly checking user login status and roles within the `dazz_cs_launch` function or replacing the custom logic to determine admin paths.
