** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The Apache Helix Front (UI) component contained a hard-coded secret, allowing an attacker to spoof sessions by generating their own fake cookies.

This issue affects Apache Helix Front (UI): all versions.

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.
