# Wiki request suppression ignores the suppression settings set by the suppressor

Moderate

published
GHSA-8wjf-mxjg-j8p9
Mar 26, 2024

## Package

CreateWiki
(MediaWiki)

## Affected versions

<0c7c4f93834349be8f5c2a678e9a85b4b1aa7bab

## Patched versions

=>0c7c4f93834349be8f5c2a678e9a85b4b1aa7bab

## Description

### Impact

Suppression of wiki requests does not work as intended, and always restricts visibility to those with the `(createwiki)` user right regardless of the settings one sets on a given wiki request.

This may expose information to users who are not supposed to be able to access it.

### Patches

<https://gist.githubusercontent.com/redbluegreenhat/0da1ebb7185b241ce1ac6ba1e8f0b98d/raw/44c4a229aacc8233808c767a79af9e4fd581ae68/T11993.patch>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
