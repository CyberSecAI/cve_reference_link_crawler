# Description

Suppression of wiki requests is broken and does not work as intended. It is not possible to suppress requests beyond (createwiki), and restricting visibility to those with (read) permissions, which is effectively the same as making public the request, does not work.

This is due to CreateWiki basing the visibility of requests of of visibility from the form data:

<https://github.com/miraheze/CreateWiki/blob/dc9286a2a930048a4453ef6815ac8c39500661c3/includes/RequestWiki/RequestWikiRequestViewer.php#L33C1-L38C5>

```
$visibilityConds = [
  0 => 'read',
  1 => 'createwiki',
  2 => 'delete',
  3 => 'suppressrevision',
];
```

This is a mapping of user right required to view a suppressed request to their value on cw\_wikis' cw\_visibility column. Note how 1 is mapped to (createwiki).

Here is the section of code that CreateWiki runs to set request visibility when someone suppresses a request (<https://github.com/miraheze/CreateWiki/blob/dc9286a2a930048a4453ef6815ac8c39500661c3/includes/RequestWiki/RequestWikiRequestViewer.php#L394C1-L396C1>):

```
elseif ( isset( $formData['submit-handle'] ) ) {
  $request->visibility = $formData['visibility'];
```

$request->visibility here will be stored on this request's row as cw\_visibility. The issue here is that visibility on the form descriptor is an element that is set to 1 whenever ones clicks the "Set visibility restrictions" button. The actual suppression settings chosen by the handler of the wiki request is on the [visibility-options](https://github.com/miraheze/CreateWiki/blob/dc9286a2a930048a4453ef6815ac8c39500661c3/includes/RequestWiki/RequestWikiRequestViewer.php#L263C5-L271C7) key on the form data. So, regardless of which suppression setting one chooses, cw\_visibility will always be set to one (only users with (createwiki) permission).

This is an issue because suppression is normally used to redact PII, and this bug may expose PII to users who are not allowed to view it.

## Description

### Impact

Suppression of wiki requests does not work as intended, and always restricts visibility to those with the `(createwiki)` user right regardless of the settings one sets on a given wiki request.

This may expose information to users who are not supposed to be able to access it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
