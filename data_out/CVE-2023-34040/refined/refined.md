- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Java deserialization vulnerability due to the lack of proper handling of deserialization exceptions when specific configurations are applied. Specifically, when `checkDeserExWhenKeyNull` and/or `checkDeserExWhenValueNull` are set to true without an `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe deserialization of a malicious object present in the deserialization exception record headers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can construct a malicious serialized object in one of the deserialization exception record headers. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to publish messages to a Kafka topic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to publish to a Kafka topic and the application needs to have the vulnerable configurations (i.e.,  `checkDeserExWhenKeyNull` or `checkDeserExWhenValueNull` set to true without an `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`) configured.
