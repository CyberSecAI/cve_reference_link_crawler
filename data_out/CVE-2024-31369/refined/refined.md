- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Soledad theme for WordPress versions 8.4.5 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a malicious request that, when unknowingly triggered by an authenticated user, would perform unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into triggering it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
