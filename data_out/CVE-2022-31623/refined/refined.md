Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper locking within the `create_worker_threads` function in `extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc`. Specifically, the mutex `thd->ctrl_mutex` is not released when an error occurs during thread creation (`pthread_create`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Unlock:** The code fails to unlock the `thd->ctrl_mutex` when `pthread_create` fails, leading to a potential deadlock.
- **Unreleased Lock:** If the initialization of any of the non-first mutex/condition variables errors occurs, the mutexes of previous threads are not released.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, likely due to threads being blocked indefinitely waiting for the unreleased mutex.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered locally, as indicated by the CVSS vector `AV:L`.
- The attack requires low privileges, shown by `PR:L`.
- No user interaction is needed `UI:N`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need local access to the system with low privileges.
- The attacker would need to trigger the execution of the vulnerable code path, leading to a thread creation failure.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding a loop to unlock the previously acquired mutexes before exiting the `create_worker_threads` function when an error occurs.
- The fix was included in multiple MariaDB versions including 10.2.42, 10.3.33, 10.4.23, 10.5.14, 10.6.6, and 10.7.2.
