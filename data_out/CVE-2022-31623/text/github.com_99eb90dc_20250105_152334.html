| [@ryancaicse](https://github.com/ryancaicse) , I did a few changed I'd like to you review:   * I remarked this as MDEV-26561 as its the issue related to the change * Moved this back to the earliest 10.2 branch where the bug started. * I also added a second commit to release previous mutexes of the other threads. Please make sure it makes sense regardless with jump to err occurs or which iteration of the loop it is. |
