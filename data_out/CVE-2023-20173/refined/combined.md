To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.  For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xxe-inj-696OZTCm>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco ISE.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  **Note**: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of the Cisco ISE system. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure the access restrictions, choose **Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access.**  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20173: Cisco Identity Services Engine XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid *Administrator* level privileges on the affected device.  This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd93719](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd93719)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20173Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.9CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2023-20174: Cisco Identity Services Engine XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid *Administrator* level privileges on the affected device.  This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary network requests that are sourced from the affected system.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd38137](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd38137)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20174Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.1CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
