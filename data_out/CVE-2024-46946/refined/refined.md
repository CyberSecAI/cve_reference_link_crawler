{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `sympy.sympify()` to evaluate mathematical expressions without proper input sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
      "Use of `eval()` equivalent without proper restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can control the input to `SymbolicMathChain` could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system running the LangChain application, leading to full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Control of input to the `SymbolicMathChain` component."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to influence the input string processed by the `SymbolicMathChain`."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "SymbolicMathChain_introduction": "The `SymbolicMathChain` class was introduced in the commit `fcccde406dd9e9b05fc9babcbeb9ff527b0ec0c6`. It uses a regular expression to match content between `text` delimiters and passes this content to `sympy.sympify()` for evaluation.",
    "sympy.sympify_vulnerability": "`sympy.sympify()` internally uses Python's `eval()` function, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if not properly restricted.",
     "poc": "The following payload demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary system commands: `sympy.sympify(\"this.__class__.__mro__[8].__subclasses__()[154].__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']['exec']('import os;os.system(\\\"id\\\")')\")`"
