The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, which shows changes made to the code. The commit message "real_escape_string() to prevent SQL injections on database." indicates that the changes are related to addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown based on the provided diff:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability was the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs before they were used in SQL queries. This allowed for the possibility of SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- SQL Injection: The code was previously vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in several files. Specifically, the `student/index.php`, `teacher/create.php`, and `teacher/login.php` were vulnerable due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied variables in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL queries by injecting malicious code through the `session`, `student`, `id_check`, or `pass` variables. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized data access
    - Data modification or deletion
    - Potential execution of arbitrary code on the database server

**Attack vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through the web interface where the `student`, `session`, `id_check`, and `pass` parameters are passed. An attacker can use crafted inputs to manipulate the queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the web application's forms or directly manipulate HTTP requests to inject SQL code. No special position on the network is required, as long as they can access the web application.

**Details from the diff:**

- **`webserver/student/index.php`**:
    - The diff shows the addition of `$con->real_escape_string()` to sanitize the `$session` and `$student` variables before using them in the SQL query:
      ```php
      $session = $con->real_escape_string($session);
      $student = $con->real_escape_string($student);
      ```

- **`webserver/teacher/create.php`**:
    - The diff shows the addition of `$con->real_escape_string()` to sanitize `$id_check` twice, even if one is redundant, before using it in the SQL query:
      ```php
      $id_check = $con->real_escape_string($id_check);
      $id_check = $con->real_escape_string($id_check);
      ```

- **`webserver/teacher/login.php`**:
    - The diff shows the addition of `$con->real_escape_string()` to sanitize both `$session` and `$pass` variables before using them in the SQL query:
      ```php
      $session = $con->real_escape_string($session);
      $pass = $con->real_escape_string($pass);
      ```

- **`webserver/teacher/email/welcome.php`**:
    - This file was not directly related to the vulnerability, it had a minor change in a comment.
- **`webserver/teacher/welcomeEmail.php`**:
    - This file was removed in this commit.
- **`webserver/img/Thumbs.db`**:
    - Binary file was modified, not related to SQL injection fix

The commit aims to prevent SQL injection by escaping potentially malicious characters in the user-provided variables before they are included in SQL queries. The use of `real_escape_string` is a common approach to mitigate this type of vulnerability.
