Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The `AuthInterceptor` class has a flawed check that allows requests with path traversal sequences (`/rest/../`) to bypass authentication. Specifically, the check `if (requestPath.length()>3&&"rest/".equals(requestPath.substring(0,5)))` only verifies that the path starts with `/rest/`, without properly sanitizing the rest of the path.
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The `cgformTemplateController.showPic` API doesn't validate the `code` and `path` parameters, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The flawed `AuthInterceptor` allows unauthenticated access to the vulnerable `cgformTemplateController` API.
*   **Path Traversal:** Lack of sanitization of the path parameters within the `showPic` method enables path traversal, which is used to access files outside of the intended upload directory.
*  **Arbitrary File Read:** The combination of the bypass and path traversal makes arbitrary file read possible.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read any file on the server's filesystem accessible by the application's user. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, passwords, source code, and other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/rest/../cgformTemplateController.do?showPic`).
*   **Path Traversal:** The attacker uses the `code` and `path` parameters within the request to specify the target file location using path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*  **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited pre-authentication.
*  **HTTP Request Creation:** The attacker needs to craft HTTP requests.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates reading the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of `jeewms` up to and including version `v3.7`.
* The content risk flag indicates that this issue contains sensitive information.

This information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its root causes, impact, attack vectors, and necessary attacker capabilities.
