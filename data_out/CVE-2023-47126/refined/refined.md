Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The login screen of the TYPO3 Install Tool, in composer-based installations, was disclosing the full server path to the transient data directory, which contains the `ENABLE_INSTALL_TOOL` file. This file's presence unlocks the Install Tool, and knowing the path could aid attackers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the full server path, which is sensitive information about the system's directory structure.
*   **Lack of Proper Sanitization:** The application was not sanitizing or masking the path before displaying it on the login screen.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Limited Impact:** The impact is considered low because the disclosed path does not directly grant access or control over the system. However, this information could be used by an attacker as a reconnaissance step in a larger attack.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The full path disclosure could reveal details about the system's structure and environment. This could allow an attacker to make more informed decisions about further attack strategies, such as where to potentially upload malicious files or locate other exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely, since the Install Tool login screen is web-based.
*   **Accessing the Install Tool Login:** The attacker needs to access the login screen of the TYPO3 Install Tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is required to access the vulnerable login screen and view the path.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the TYPO3 instance.
*   **Knowledge of TYPO3 Install Tool:** The attacker would need to be aware of how the TYPO3 install tool works and where the `ENABLE_INSTALL_TOOL` file is located.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability only affects composer-based installations of TYPO3. "Classic" installations are not vulnerable.
*   The fix involves displaying the path relative to the project root, instead of the full path.
*   The commit message indicates that the full path is not shown anymore, and only the relative path is shown on the login screen.
*   The fix was implemented in `LoginController.php` and `EnableFileService.php`.
*   The affected versions are TYPO3 versions 12.2.0 through 12.4.7. The issue was resolved in version 12.4.8.
*   The CVSS score of 3.5 reflects a low severity, mainly due to the high attack complexity and low confidentiality impact.
*   The fix includes using `getStaticLocationForInstallToolEnableFileDirectory()` to return 'var/transient/' for composer installations or 'typo3conf/' for classic installations, instead of deriving the path using `Environment::getPublicPath()`.

This vulnerability is an example of an information disclosure issue that, while not critical on its own, can contribute to a broader attack.
