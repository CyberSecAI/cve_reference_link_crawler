# Information Disclosure in Install Tool

GHSA-p2jh-95jg-2w55
Nov 14, 2023

## Package

composer

typo3/cms-install
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

12.2.0-12.4.7

## Patched versions

12.4.8

## Description

> ### CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (3.5)

### Problem

The login screen of the standalone install tool discloses the full path of the transient data directory (e.g. */var/www/html/var/transient/*). This applies to composer-based scenarios only - “classic” non-composer installations are not affected.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 version 12.4.8 that fixes the problem described above.

### Credits

Thanks to Markus Klein who reported and fixed the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
