- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress ChatBot Plugin <= 4.7.8 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to perform actions as a logged-in user without their consent.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a forged request initiated by the attacker, which the user unknowingly submits.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious page that triggers the forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
