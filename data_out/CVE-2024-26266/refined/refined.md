- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when creating an entry in the Announcements and Alerts widgets, specifically the first/middle/last name text fields of the user creating the entry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the application. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the Announcements and Alerts widgets. An authenticated user can inject a malicious payload into their first/middle/last name fields. When other users view the announcement or alert created by this user, the injected script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create announcements or alerts.
