- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials for the Tomcat Manager in FortiPortal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798) leading to authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute unauthorized commands as root by deploying malicious web application archive files. This allows for full compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated network access to the FortiPortal web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the FortiPortal instance and the ability to upload and deploy web application archive files. No prior authentication is needed.
