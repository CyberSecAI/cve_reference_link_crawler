|  |  | = Java System Properties Affecting Ivy |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | == XML Parser Settings |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Starting with Ivy 2.5.2 Ivy's XML parser can be controlled via the use |
|  |  | of two newly introduced system properties. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you want to restore the default behavior of Ivy 2.5.1 and earlier |
|  |  | you need to set `ivy.xml.allow-doctype-processing` to `true` and |
|  |  | `ivy.xml.external-resources` to `ALL`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | === `ivy.xml.allow-doctype-processing` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This system property accepts `true` or `false` as values. When set to |
|  |  | `false` Ivy will not allow any processing of doctype declarations at |
|  |  | all, while setting it to `true` enables it. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The default is to allow doctype processing if and only if Ivy is |
|  |  | parsing a Maven POM file. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | === `ivy.xml.external-resources` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This system property controls if external resources are read during |
|  |  | doctype processing - and if so, where they can be loadad from. The |
|  |  | value of this system property is only ever used if |
|  |  | `ivy.xml.allow-doctype-processing` is not `false`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The accepted values are |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* `PROHIBIT` makes Ivy fail if any doctype tries to load an external |
|  |  | resource. |
|  |  | \* `IGNORE` makes Ivy ignore any external resource that the doctype |
|  |  | declaration wants to load. |
|  |  | \* `LOCAL\_ONLY` allows external resources to be loaded via `file:` or |
|  |  | `jar:file` URIs only. |
|  |  | \* `ALL` allows external resources to be loaded from any URI. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The default behavior is to not allow doctype processing at all, but if |
|  |  | it is enabled the value `PROHIBIT` is assumed unless the property has |
|  |  | been set explicitly. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When reading Maven POMs a specific internal system id is recognized as |
|  |  | resource and will be loaded from a resource shipping with the Ivy |
|  |  | distribution in order to deal with invalid POM files accepted by |
|  |  | Apache Maven - and the default value for this property is |
|  |  | `IGNORE`in that case. See |
|  |  | link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY-921[IVY-921] for |
|  |  | details. |

Thanks for these fixe

Unfortunately, this affectation is a problem when XMLreader don't use this property (ex : javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory) : this throws the exception org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException.

You should write this code like trySetAttribute l402

Hy Stefan,
Is it possible to release Ivy 2.5.3 with this fix ? Version 2.5.2, which fixes many CVEs, is unusable in our contexts without this fix.
Thanks.
