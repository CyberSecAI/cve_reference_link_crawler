SECURITY-3233 / CVE-2023-41930 (path traversal) & CVE-2023-41931 (XSS)
Job Configuration History Plugin 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and earlier does not
restrict a `name` query parameter when rendering a history entry. This
allows attackers to have Jenkins render a manipulated configuration history
that was not created by the plugin.

The history view does not property sanitize or escape the timestamp value
from history entries when rendering a history entry. This typically isn't a
problem, as the value is numeric in genuine history entries. Combined with
the path traversal vulnerability, this results in a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with the ability to
create a file on the controller (e.g., archived artifacts).

SECURITY-3235 / CVE-2023-41932 (path traversal) & CVE-2023-41933 (XXE)
Job Configuration History Plugin 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and earlier does not
restrict `timestamp` query parameters in multiple endpoints. This allows
attackers with Job Config History/DeleteEntry permission to delete
attacker-specified directories on the Jenkins controller file system as
long as they contain a file called `history.xml`.

Additionally, Job Configuration History Plugin 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and
earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity
(XXE) attacks. This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to have
Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

SECURITY-3257 / CVE-2023-41934
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin integrates with Config File Provider
Plugin to specify custom Maven settings, including credentials for
authentication.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 1330.v18e473854496 and earlier does not
properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) usernames of credentials
specified in custom Maven settings in Pipeline build logs if "Treat
username as secret" is checked.

SECURITY-3227 / CVE-2023-41935
Azure AD Plugin 396.v86ce29279947 and earlier, except
378.380.v545b_1154b_3fb_, does not use a constant-time comparison when
checking whether the provided and expected CSRF protection nonce are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid nonce.

SECURITY-3228 / CVE-2023-41936
Google Login Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison
when checking whether the provided and expected token are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid token.

SECURITY-3165 / CVE-2023-41937
Bitbucket Push and Pull Request Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at
`/bitbucket-hook/` to receive webhook notifications.

When acting on these notifications, Bitbucket Push and Pull Request Plugin
2.4.0 through 2.8.3 (both inclusive) trusts values provided in the webhook
payload, including certain URLs, and uses configured Bitbucket credentials
to connect to those URLs. This allows attackers to capture Bitbucket
credentials stored in Jenkins by sending a crafted webhook payload.

NOTE: Successful exploitation requires that a build is triggered. This is
the case when the repository has changed since the previous build, or the
option "Trigger also if nothing has changed in the repo" is checked.

SECURITY-3018 / CVE pending
Qualys Container Scanning Connector Plugin 1.6.2.6 and earlier does not
correctly perform a permission check in multiple HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking
Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to do the following:

* Enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
  Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using
  another vulnerability.
* Connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
stored in Jenkins.

SECURITY-2924 / CVE-2022-46751
Ivy Plugin 2.5 and earlier bundles versions of Apache Ivy vulnerable to
CVE-2022-46751.

This allows attackers able to control the input file for the "Trigger the
build of other projects based on the Ivy dependency management system"
post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses
external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or
server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3093 / CVE-2023-41938
Ivy Plugin 2.5 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP
endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to delete disabled modules.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3064 / CVE-2023-41939
SSH2 Easy Plugin 1.4 and earlier does not verify that permissions
configured to be granted are enabled. This may allow users formerly granted
(typically optional permissions, like Overall/Manage) to access
functionality they're no longer entitled to.

NOTE: As a workaround, administrators can save the permission configuration
after disabling a permission, as that will overwrite any permission
assignments of disabled permissions.

SECURITY-3190 / CVE-2023-41940
TAP Plugin 2.3 and earlier does not escape TAP file contents.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control TAP file contents.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3101 (1) / CVE-2023-41941
AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin 3.0.12 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of AWS credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3101 (2) / CVE-2023-41942 (CSRF) & CVE-2023-41943 (permission check)
AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin 3.0.12 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to clear the SQS queue.

Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3102 / CVE-2023-41944
AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin 3.0.12 and earlier does not escape the queue
name parameter passed to a form validation URL, when rendering an error
message.

This results in an HTML injection vulnerability.

NOTE: Since Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2, a
link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.263/#formvalidation[security hardening] for form
validation responses prevents JavaScript execution, so no scripts can be
injected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3065 / CVE-2023-41945
Assembla Auth Plugin provides an authorization strategy that defines four
levels of access to Jenkins, based on the corresponding permissions in
Assembla spaces: ALL, EDIT, VIEW, and NONE.

Assembla Auth Plugin 1.14 and earlier does not verify that the permissions
it grants are enabled. This results in users with EDIT permissions to be
granted Overall/Manage and Overall/SystemRead permissions, even if those
permissions are disabled and should not be granted.

NOTE: Additionally, the plugin also grants the deprecated permissions
Overall/RunScripts, Overall/UploadPlugins and Overall/ConfigureUpdateCenter
to users with EDIT access. These permissions allow arbitrary code execution
through various means in Jenkins before 2.222. Additionally, plugins not
yet adapted to the changes in Jenkins 2.222 may also provide access to
sensitive features to users with these permissions.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3082 / CVE-2023-41946 (CSRF) & CVE-2023-41947 (permission check)
Frugal Testing Plugin 1.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to do the following:

* Connect to Frugal Testing using attacker-specified username and password.
* Retrieve test IDs and names from Frugal Testing, if a valid credential
  corresponds to the attacker-specified username.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## 13 Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) Security Guide

The JDK and
Java XML APIs have been improved over the years with various measures and tools that
can help prevent applications from being exploited by XML-related attacks. This
guide shows you how to use the secure processing features of Java API for XML
Processing (JAXP) to safeguard your applications and systems.

### Potential Attacks During XML Processing

XML processing can expose applications to certain vulnerabilities. Among the
most prominent and well-known attacks are the XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack and
the exponential entity expansion attack, also know as the XML bomb or billion laughs attack.
These attacks can potentially cause serious damage to a system by denying its services or
worse, lead to the loss of sensitive data.

You should evaluate your applications' requirements and operating environment to
assess the level of potential threat, for example, whether or to what extent the
applications are exposed to untrusted XML sources.

#### XML External Entity Injection Attack

The XML, XML Schema, and XSLT standards define a number of structures that
enable the embedding of external content in XML documents through system identifiers
that reference external resources. In general, XML processors resolve and retrieve
almost all of these external resources; see [External Resources Supported by XML, Schema, and XSLT Standards](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-CA5DB2A1-806B-4835-87F1-841AE08CA8CB "XML, Schema, and XSLT standards support the following constructs that require external resources. The default behavior of the JDK XML processors is to make a connection and fetch the external resources as specified.") for a list of constructs that support the inclusion of external
resources. In addition, some constructs enable the execution of applications through
external functions. XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks exploit XML processors
that have not been secured by restricting the external resources that it may resolve,
retrieve, or execute. This can result in disclosing sensitive data such as passwords or
enabling arbitrary execution of code.

##### External Resources Supported by XML, Schema, and XSLT Standards

XML, Schema, and XSLT standards support the
following constructs that require external resources. The default behavior of the JDK XML
processors is to make a connection and fetch the external resources as
specified.

* External DTD: references an external Document Type Definition (DTD), for
  example:

  ```
  <!DOCTYPE root_element SYSTEM "url">
  ```
* External Entity Reference: Refers to external data, the following is the
  syntax:

  ```
  <!ENTITY name SYSTEM "url">
  ```
* General entity reference, for example:

  ```
  <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no" ?>
  <!DOCTYPE doc [<!ENTITY otherFile SYSTEM "otherFile.xml">]>
  <doc>
      <a>
          <b>&otherFile;</b>
      </a>
  </doc>
  ```
* External Parameter Entities: The following is the syntax:

  ```
  <!ENTITY % name SYSTEM uri>
  ```

  The following is an example:

  ```
  <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
      <!DOCTYPE doc [
        <!ENTITY % ent1 SYSTEM "http://www.example.com/student.dtd">
        %ent1;
      ]>
  ```
* XInclude: Includes an external infoset in an XML document, for
  example:
  ```
  <Book xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
      <xi:include href=toc.xml"/>
      <xi:include href=part1.xml"/>
      <xi:include href=part2.xml"/>
      <xi:include href=index.xml"/>
  </Book>
  ```
* References to XML Schema components using the `schemaLocation`
  attribute and `import` and `include` elements, for
  example:

  ```
  <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
      <xs:include schemaLocation="http://www.example.com/schema/schema1.xsd"/>
      <!-- ... -->
  </xs:schema>
  ```
* Combining style sheets using import or include elements, the following
  is the
  syntax:
  ```
  <xsl:include href="include.xsl"/>
  ```
* `xml-stylesheet` processing instruction: Used to include
  a stylesheet in an XML document, for
  example:
  ```
  <?xml-stylesheet href="include.xsl" type="text/xsl"?>
  ```
* XSLT `document()` function: Used to access nodes in an external XML
  document, for
  example:
  ```
  <xsl:variable name="dummy" select="document('DocumentFunc2.xml')"/>
  ```

#### Exponential Entity Expansion Attack

The exponential entity expansion attack, also know as the XML
bomb or billion laughs attack, is a denial-of-service attack that involves XML parsers. The
basic exploit is to have several layers of nested entities, each referring to a number of
entities of the next layer. The following is a sample SOAP document that contains deeply
nested entity references:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE bbb[
    <!ENTITY x100 "bbb">
    <!ENTITY  x99 "&x100;&x100;">
    <!ENTITY  x98 "&x99;&x99;">
    ...
    <!ENTITY   x2 "&x3;&x3;">
    <!ENTITY   x1 "&x2;&x2;">
]>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=...>
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        <ns1:aaa xmlns:ns1="urn:aaa" SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="...">
            <foobar xsi:type="xsd:string">&x1;</foobar>
        </ns1:aaa>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

When an XML parser encounters such a document, it will attempt to resolve
the entity declaration by expanding the references. Because the references are nested,
the expansion becomes exponential by the number of entities each refers to. Such a
process can lead the XML parser to consume 100% of CPU time and a large amount of
memory, and eventually the system runs out of memory.

### Feature for Secure Processing (FSP)

Feature for Secure Processing (FSP), which is defined as [javax.xml.XMLConstants.FEATURE\_SECURE\_PROCESSING](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.xml/javax/xml/XMLConstants.html#FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING), is the
central mechanism to help safeguard XML processing. It instructs XML processors, such as
parsers, validators, and transformers, to try and process XML securely.

By default, the JDK turns on FSP for DOM and SAX parsers and XML schema validators, which
sets a number of processing limits on the processors. Conversely, by default, the JDK
turns off FSP for transformers and XPath, which enables extension functions for XSLT and
XPath.

Turn on and off FSP by calling the setFeature method on factories and
setting XMLConstants.FEATURE\_SECURE\_PROCESSING to either
`true` or `false`. For example, the following code
snippet turns on FSP for SAX parsers that are created by the factory
`spf` by setting
XMLConstants.FEATURE\_SECURE\_PROCESSING to
`true`:

```
    SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
    spf.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);
```

While FSP can be turned on and off through factories, it is always on when a
Java Security Manager is present and cannot be turned off. The Java XML processors
therefore will enforce limits and restrictions when a Java Security Manager is present.
You can however adjust individual properties depending on the specific needs of your
applications. There are two types of JAXP properties:

* Processing limits: Helps guard against excessive memory consumption
  from XML processing.
* External access restrictions: Controls the fetching of external resources.

The following sections describe these two types of JAXP properties.

#### JAXP Properties for Processing Limits

XML processing can sometimes be a memory intensive operation. Applications,
especially those that accept XML, XSD and XSL from untrusted sources, should take steps to
guard against excessive memory consumption by using JAXP properties for processing
limits.

Evaluate your application's requirements and operating environment to
determine the acceptable processing limits for your system configurations and set these
limits accordingly. For example, use size-related limits to prevent malformed XML
sources from consuming large amounts of memory. Use
`EntityExpansionLimit` to enable an application to control memory
consumption under an acceptable level.

The JDK XML parsers observe processing limits by default. Both DOM and SAX
parsers have Feature for Secure Processing (FSP) turned on by default and therefore turn
on the limits. The StAX parser also observes processing limits by default even though it
doesn't support FSP.

The JDK XML processors enable you to adjust processing limits individually in three
ways:

* Through standard XML APIs
* By using System properties
* In the `jaxp.properties` file

See [Using JAXP Properties](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-3668AE7A-2168-4A31-A254-FAD228F9DDD6) and [Scope and Order](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-F93E1AE4-2565-430F-82CB-6BE068A65918).

#### JAXP Properties for External Access Restrictions

The JAXP Properties for external access restrictions, along
with their corresponding System properties, enable you to regulate external
connections.

External access restrictions enable you to specify the type of external
connections that can or cannot be permitted. The property values are a list of
protocols. The JAXP processors check if a given external connection is permitted by
matching the protocol with those in the list. Processors will attempt to establish the
connection if it is on the list, or reject it if not. Use these JAXP properties along
with custom resolvers and the Catalog API (see [Using Resolvers and Catalogs](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-32E8D3A7-01C9-4175-9ABC-455E44E1BBC7 "You can register custom resolvers and catalogs on a JDK XML processor to intercept any references to external resources and resolve them with local ones. This feature eliminates the need to read and access external resources, thus helping to remove a source of potential risk.")) to reduce the risk of external connections by rejecting and
resolving them with local resources.

Note:

Explicitly turning on Feature for
Secure Processing (FSP) through the API, for example,
`factory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true)`,
disables all external connections.

The external access restrictions JAXP properties are defined in
javax.xml.XMLConstants as follows:

Values of External Access Restrictions JAXP Properties

All JAXP properties for external access restrictions have values of the
same format:

* Value: A list of protocols separated by comma. A protocol
  is the scheme portion of an URI, or in the case of the JAR protocol,
  `jar` plus the scheme portion separated by colon. A
  scheme is defined as:

  `scheme = alpha *( alpha | digit | "+" | "-" |
  "." )`

  where `alpha` =
  `a-z` and `A-Z`.

  The JAR protocol is
  defined as: `jar[:scheme]`

  Protocols are case-insensitive. Any whitespace characters as
  defined by Character.isSpaceChar in the
  value are ignored. Examples of protocols are `file`,
  `http`, and `jar:file`.
* Default value: The default value is implementation specific. For the
  JDK, the default value is `all`, which grants permissions to
  all protocols.
* Granting all access: The keyword `all`
  grants permission to all protocols. For example, specifying
  `javax.xml.accessExternalDTD=all` in the
  `jaxp.properties` file enables a system to work as before
  with no restrictions on accessing external DTDs and entity references.
* Denying any access: An empty string (`""`) means that
  no permission is granted to any protocol. For example, specifying
  `javax.xml.accessExternalDTD=""` in the
  `jaxp.properties` file instructs JAXP processors to deny
  any external connections.

#### Scope and Order

Scope of Setting Feature for
Secure Processing

Feature for Secure Processing (FSP) is required for XML processors
including DOM, SAX, schema validation, XSLT, and XPath.

When FSP is turned on, then default processing limits (see [JAXP Properties for Processing Limits](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-82F8C206-F2DF-4204-9544-F96155B1D258 "XML processing can sometimes be a memory intensive operation. Applications, especially those that accept XML, XSD and XSL from untrusted sources, should take steps to guard against excessive memory consumption by using JAXP properties for processing limits.")) are enforced. Turning off FSP does not change the limits.

When FSP is "explicitly" turned on through the API, for example,
`factory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING,
true)`, then external access restrictions (see [JAXP Properties for External Access Restrictions](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-94ABC0EE-9DC8-44F0-84AD-47ADD5340477 "The JAXP Properties for external access restrictions, along with their corresponding System properties, enable you to regulate external connections.")) are set to the empty string, which means that no permission is
granted to any protocol. Although FSP is turned on by default for DOM, SAX and
schema validation, it is not treated as if "explicitly" turned on; therefore, the
default value for external access restrictions is `all`, which means
that permission is granted to all protocols.

When a Java Security Manager is present, FSP is turned on and cannot be
turned off.

Scope and Order of Setting JAXP
Properties

In general, JAXP properties set in a smaller scope override those in a
larger one:

* JAXP properties specified through JAXP factories or processors take
  preference over System properties, the `jaxp.properties` file,
  and FSP.
* System properties, when set, affect one JDK invocation only and override
  processing limit and external access restriction values set by default, set in
  the `jaxp.properties` file, or set by FSP.
* Properties specified in the `jaxp.properties` file affect the
  entire JDK and override processing limit and external access restriction values
  set by default or set by FSP.

Scope of Setting External Access
Restrictions

External access restrictions have no effect on the relevant constructs
that they attempt to restrict in the following situations:

* When there is a resolver and the source returned by the resolver
  is not null: This applies to entity resolvers that may be set on SAX and DOM
  parsers, XML resolvers on StAX parsers, LSResourceResolver on SchemaFactory, a Validator or
  ValidatorHandler, or URIResolver on a transformer.
* When a schema is created explicitly by calling the newSchema method from SchemaFactory.
* When external resources are not required: For example, the
  following features and properties are supported by the JDK and may be used
  to instruct the processor to not load the external DTD or resolve external
  entities:

  ```
  http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl true
  http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd false
  http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities false
  http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities false
  ```

#### Relationship with Security Manager

JAXP properties are checked first before a connection is
attempted, whether or not a SecurityManager is present. This
means that a connection may be blocked even if it is granted permission by the SecurityManager. For example, if the JAXP properties are set to
disallow the HTTP protocol, then they will effectively block any connection attempt even
when an application has a SocketPermission.

For the purpose of restricting connections, the SecurityManager can be viewed as being at a lower level. Permissions are
checked after JAXP properties are evaluated. For example, if an application does not
have a SocketPermission, then a SecurityException will be thrown even if JAXP properties are set to allow
HTTP connections.

When a SecurityManager is present, Feature for
Secure Processing (FSP) is set to true. This behavior does not turn on any external
access restrictions.

#### When to Use Processing Limits

When determining which processing limits to apply and what values
to use, at the system level, consider the amount of memory available for applications and
whether XML, XSD, or XSL sources from untrusted sources are accepted and processed. At the
application level, consider whether certain constructs such as DTDs are used.

Memory Setting and Limits

XML processing can be very memory intensive. The amount of memory that
should be allowed to be consumed depends on the requirements of the applications in
a specific environment. Processing of malformed XML data must be prevented from
consuming excessive memory.

The default limits are generally set to allow legitimate XML inputs for
most applications with memory usage allowed for a small hardware system, such as a
PC. It is recommended that the limits are set to the smallest possible values, so
that any malformed input can be caught before it consumes large amounts of memory.

The limits are correlated, but not entirely redundant. You should set
appropriate values for all of the limits: usually the limits should be set to a much
smaller value than the default.

For example, `ENTITY_EXPANSION_LIMIT` and
`GENERAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT` can be set to prevent excessive
entity references. But when the exact combination of the expansion and entity sizes
are unknown, `TOTAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT` can serve as a overall
control. Similarly, while `TOTAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT` controls the
total size of a replacement text, if the text is a very large chunk of XML,
`ENTITY_REPLACEMENT_LIMIT` sets a restriction on the total number
of nodes that can appear in the text and prevents overloading the system.

Estimating the Limits Using the
getEntityCountInfo Property

To help you analyze what values you should set for the limits, a special
property called
`http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/getEntityCountInfo` is
available. The following code snippet, from [Processing Limit Samples](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/limits/sample.html) in
The Java Tutorials, shows an example of using the
property:

```
    public static final String ORACLE_JAXP_PROPERTY_PREFIX =
        "http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/";
    // ...
    public static final String JDK_ENTITY_COUNT_INFO =
        ORACLE_JAXP_PROPERTY_PREFIX + "getEntityCountInfo";
    // ...
    parser.setProperty(JDK_ENTITY_COUNT_INFO, "yes");
```

When you run the processing limit sample with the DTD in W3C MathML 3.0,
it prints out the following table:

Table 13-14 Running JAXP Processing Limits
Sample with DTD in W3C MatchML 3.0

| Property | Limit | Total Size | Size | Entity Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ENTITY_EXPANSION_LIMIT` | 64000 | 1417 | 0 | null |
| `MAX_OCCUR_NODE_LIMIT` | 5000 | 0 | 0 | null |
| `ELEMENT_ATTRIBUTE_LIMIT` | 10000 | 0 | 0 | null |
| `TOTAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT` | 50000000 | 55425 | 0 | null |
| `GENERAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT` | 0 | 0 | 0 | null |
| `PARAMETER_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT` | 1000000 | 0 | 7303 | `%MultiScriptExpression` |
| `MAX_ELEMENT_DEPTH_LIMIT` | 0 | 2 | 0 | null |
| `MAX_NAME_LIMIT` | 1000 | 13 | 13 | null |
| `ENTITY_REPLACEMENT_LIMIT` | 3000000 | 0 | 0 | null |

In this example, the total number of entity references, or the entity
expansion, is 1417; the default limit is 64000. The total size of all entities is
55425; the default limit is 50000000. The biggest parameter entity is
`%MultiScriptExpression` with a length of 7303 after all
references are resolved; the default limit is 1000000.

If this is the largest file that the application is expected to process,
it is recommended that the limits be set to smaller numbers. For example, 2000 for
`ENTITY_EXPANSION_LIMIT`, 100000 for
`TOTAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT`, and 10000 for
`PARAMETER_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT`.

#### When to Use External Access Restrictions

The XML processors, by default, attempt to connect and read external resources that are
referenced in XML sources. Note that this may potentially expose applications and
systems to risks posed by external connections. It's therefore recommended that
applications consider limiting external connections with external access restriction
properties.

Internal applications and systems that handle only trusted XML documents may
not need these restrictions. Applications and systems that rely on the Java Security
Manager to regulate external connections may also have no need for them. However, keep
in mind that external access restrictions are specific to the XML processors and are at
the top layer of the process, which means that the processors check these restrictions
before any connections are made. They may therefore serve as an additional and more
direct protection against external connection risks.

You can use external access restriction properties along with custom resolvers and
catalogs (see [Using Resolvers and Catalogs](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-32E8D3A7-01C9-4175-9ABC-455E44E1BBC7 "You can register custom resolvers and catalogs on a JDK XML processor to intercept any references to external resources and resolve them with local ones. This feature eliminates the need to read and access external resources, thus helping to remove a source of potential risk.")) to effectively manage external connections and reduce risks.

Even in a trusted environment with trusted sources, it's recommended that
you use both external access restrictions and resolvers to minimize dependencies on
external sources.

#### Using JAXP Properties

Setting Properties Through JAXP
Factories

If you can modify your application's code, or you're creating a new application, then
setting JAXP properties through JAXP factories or a parser is the preferred method.
Set these properties through the following interfaces:

```
    DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
    dbf.setAttribute(name, value);

    SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
    SAXParser parser = spf.newSAXParser();
    parser.setProperty(name, value);

    XMLInputFactory xif = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
    xif.setProperty(name, value);

    SchemaFactory schemaFactory = SchemaFactory.newInstance(schemaLanguage);
    schemaFactory.setProperty(name, value);

    TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
    factory.setAttribute(name, value);
```

The following is an example of setting processing limits:

```
    dbf.setAttribute(JDK_ENTITY_EXPANSION_LIMIT, "2000");
    dbf.setAttribute(TOTAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT, "100000");
    dbf.setAttribute(PARAMETER_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT, "10000");
    dbf.setAttribute(JDK_MAX_ELEMENT_DEPTH, "100");
```

The following is an example of limiting a DOM parser to only local connections for
external DTDs:

```
    dbf.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "file, jar:file");
```

If a parser module within the application handles untrusted sources, it
may further restrict access. The following code overrides those in the
`jaxp.properties` file and those specified by System
properties and enables the XML processor to read local files only:

```
    DocumentBuilderFactory dbf =
    DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
    dbf.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "file");
    // ...
    SchemaFactory schemaFactory = SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI);
    schemaFactory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "file");
    schemaFactory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA, "file");
```

As described in [Scope and Order of Setting JAXP Properties](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-F93E1AE4-2565-430F-82CB-6BE068A65918__SCOPE-AND-ORDER-OF-SETTING-JAXP-PROPERTIES), JAXP properties specified through JAXP factories have the
narrowest scope, affecting only the processors created by the factories, and
therefore override any default settings, System properties, and those in the
`jaxp.properties` file. By setting JAXP properties through
JAXP factories, you can ensure that your applications behave the same way regardless
of which JDK release you're using or whether JAXP properties are set through other
means.

Using System Properties

System properties may be useful if you can't modify your application's
code.

To set JAXP properties for an entire JDK invocation, set their
corresponding System properties on the command line.

To set JAXP properties for only a portion of the application, set their
corresponding System properties before the portion, and then clear them afterward.
For example, if your application requires access to external DTDs and schemas, then
add these lines to your application's initialization code block:

```
    System.setProperty("javax.xml.accessExternalDTD", "file, http");
    System.setProperty("javax.xml.accessExternalSchema", "file, http");
```

Then, once your application is done processing XML documents or before it exits,
clear out the properties as follows:

```
    System.clearProperty("javax.xml.accessExternalDTD");
    System.clearProperty("javax.xml.accessExternalSchema");
```

The following code, from [Processing Limit Samples](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/limits/sample.html) in
The Java Tutorials, is another example that shows how
to do this for the processing limit `maxGeneralEntitySizeLimit`:

```
    public static final String SP_GENERAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT =
        "jdk.xml.maxGeneralEntitySizeLimit";

    // Set limits using System property;
    // this setting will affect all processing after it's set
    System.setProperty(SP_GENERAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT, "2000");

    // Perform some processing here

    // After it is done, clear the property
    System.clearProperty(SP_GENERAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT);
```

Note that processing limit values are integers. A NumberFormatException is thrown if a processing limit's value is not
a parsable integer; see the method java.lang.Integer.parseInt(String).

The following example allows the resolution of external schemas for a portion of an
application:

```
    // Allow resolution of external schemas
    // This setting will affect all processing after it's set
    System.setProperty("javax.xml.accessExternalSchema", "file, http");

    // Perform some processing here

    // After it's done, clear the property
    System.clearProperty("javax.xml.accessExternalSchema");
```

Using the jaxp.properties
File

If you want to specify a JAXP property that affects every JDK
invocation, then create a configuration file named `<java-home>/conf/jaxp.properties` and specify
names and values of JAXP properties in it, one name-value pair on each line. For
example, the following `jaxp.properties` file sets the
`maxGeneralEntitySizeLimit` processing limit property to 2000 and
restricts access to the file and HTTP protocols for external references set by the
`stylesheet` processing instruction, `document`
function, and the `import` and `include` elements.

```
jdk.xml.maxGeneralEntitySizeLimit=2000
javax.xml.accessExternalStylesheet=file, http
```

If you don't want to allow any external connection by XML processors, you can set all
access external restrictions to `file` only:

```
javax.xml.accessExternalDTD=file
javax.xml.accessExternalSchema=file
javax.xml.accessExternalStylesheet=file
```

If you want to prevent applications from accidentally reading external
files through an XML processor, set the external access restrictions as follows in
the `jaxp.properties` file as follows:

```
javax.xml.accessExternalDTD=""
javax.xml.accessExternalSchema=""
javax.xml.accessExternalStylesheet=""
```

Note:

* Use the corresponding System property in the
  `jaxp.properties` file. Processing limit System
  properties have the prefix `jdk.xml`. External access
  restriction System properties have the prefix
  `javax.xml`.
* Processing limit values are integers. A NumberFormatException is thrown if a processing limit's value
  is not a parsable integer; see the method java.lang.Integer.parseInt(String).

#### Handling Errors from JAXP Properties

It is recommended that applications catch org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException when setting JAXP properties
so that the applications will work properly on older releases that don't support
them.

For example, the following method, `isNewPropertySupported`,
from [Processing Limit Samples](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/limits/sample.html) in The Java Tutorials, detects if the sample is run with a version
of the JDK that supports the `JDK_GENERAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT`
property:

```
    public boolean isNewPropertySupported() {
        try {
            SAXParser parser = getSAXParser(false, false, false);
            parser.setProperty(JDK_GENERAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT, "10000");
        } catch (ParserConfigurationException ex) {
            fail(ex.getMessage());
        } catch (SAXException ex) {
            String err = ex.getMessage();
            if (err.indexOf("Property '" + JDK_GENERAL_ENTITY_SIZE_LIMIT +
                                           "' is not recognized.") > -1) {
                // expected before this patch
                debugPrint("New limit properties not supported. Samples not run.");
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

When input files contain constructs that cause an over-the-limit exception,
applications may check the error code to determine the nature of the failure. The
following error codes are defined for processing limits:

* `EntityExpansionLimit`: JAXP00010001
* `ElementAttributeLimit`: JAXP00010002
* `MaxEntitySizeLimit`: JAXP00010003
* `TotalEntitySizeLimit`: JAXP00010004
* `MaxXMLNameLimit`: JAXP00010005
* `maxElementDepth`: JAXP00010006
* `EntityReplacementLimit`: JAXP00010007

The error code has the following format:

```
"JAXP" + components (two digits) + error category (two digits) + sequence number
```

The code JAXP00010001, therefore, represents the JAXP base parser security
limit `EntityExpansionLimit`.

If access to external resources is denied due to the restrictions set by
external access restrictions, then an exception will be thrown with an error in the
following format:

```
[type of construct]: Failed to read [type of construct]
    "[name of the external resource]", because "[type of restriction]"
    access is not allowed due to restriction set by the
    [property name] property.
```

For example, suppose the following:

* The `ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` JAXP property is set as follows:

  ```
  parser.setProperty(
      "http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property/accessExternalDTD", "file");
  ```
* Your application tries to fetch an external DTD with the HTTP protocol.
* The parser parsed an XML file that contains an external reference to
  `http://www.example.com/dtd/properties.dtd`.

The error message would look like the following:

```
External DTD: Failed to read external DTD
    "http://www.example.com/dtd/properties.dtd", because "http"
    access is not allowed due to restriction set by the
    accessExternalDTD property.
```

#### Streaming API for XML and JAXP Properties

Streaming API for XML (StAX), JSR 173, does not support
FSP nor does it support external access restrictions. However, JDK's StAX implementation
supports processing limits, and StAX in the context of JAXP supports external access
restrictions.

StAX and Processing Limits

JDK's StAX implementation supports processing limits and their
corresponding System properties. However, because FSP is not supported, you can't
turn on or off processing limits for StAX by turning on or off FSP. Processing
limits continue to behave as described in [JAXP Properties for Processing Limits](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-82F8C206-F2DF-4204-9544-F96155B1D258 "XML processing can sometimes be a memory intensive operation. Applications, especially those that accept XML, XSD and XSL from untrusted sources, should take steps to guard against excessive memory consumption by using JAXP properties for processing limits.").

StAX and External Access Restrictions

JDK's StAX implementation supports the JAXP properties related to
external access restrictions. Setting them is similar to SAX or DOM, but through the
`XMLInputFactory` class, for example:

```
    XMLInputFactory xif = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
    xif.setProperty(
        "http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property/accessExternalDTD",
        "file");
```

For compatibility, StAX properties and features take precedence over the processing
limit and external access restriction properties. For example, the
`SupportDTD` property, when set to `false`, causes
a program to throw an exception when an input file contains a DTD before it can be
parsed. Therefore, processing limits and external access restrictions on DTDs will
have no effect on applications that have disabled by setting
`SupportDTD` property to `false`.

#### Extension Functions

Because Feature for Secure Processing (FSP)
is off by default for Transformer and XPath, extension functions are allowed. For applications processing documents
from untrusted sources, it is recommended to turn off the extension functions feature. There
are two ways to do so:

* By setting FSP to true, for example:

  ```
      TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
      tf.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);
  ```
* By setting the enableExtensionFunctions property to false:

  ```
      final static String ENABLE_EXTENSION_FUNCTIONS =
          "http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/enableExtensionFunctions";
      // ...
      TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
      tf.setFeature(ENABLE_EXTENSION_FUNCTIONS, false);
  ```

In cases where extension functions are disabled as a result of installing a
Java Security Manager, applications may also choose to re-enable the extension functions
feature by setting the property enableExtensionFunctions
to true. The following table defines this property:

Table 13-15 enableExtensionFunctions

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/enableExtensionFunctions` |
| Definition | Determines whether XSLT and XPath extension functions are allowed. |
| Value | A boolean. True indicates that extension functions are allowed; False otherwise. |
| Default value | true |
| System property | `jdk.xml.enableExtensionFunctions` |
| Since | 7u60 |

### Disabling DTD Processing

If your applications
don't require DTDs, then consider disabling DTD processing to safeguard against many
common DTD-related attacks, including denial-of-service, XML external entity (XXE),
and server-side request forgery (SSRF).

Disabling DTD Processing for SAX and DOM Parsers

To disable DTD processing for SAX and DOM parsers, set the feature
`http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl`
to true through a factory. The following code snippet disables DTDs
for SAX parsers. A fatal error is thrown if the incoming XML
document contains a DOCTYPE declaration.

```
    final static String DISALLOW_DTD =
        "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl";
    // ...
    SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
    spf.setFeature(DISALLOW_DTD, true);
```

Disabling DTD
processing for StAX Parsers

To disable DTD processing for StAX parsers, set the property
`SupportDTD` with the the XMLInputFactory.setProperty
method:

```
    XMLInputFactory xif = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
    xif.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.SUPPORT_DTD, Boolean.FALSE);
```

### Using Resolvers and Catalogs

You can register custom resolvers and catalogs on a JDK XML processor to
intercept any references to external resources and resolve them with local ones.
This feature eliminates the need to read and access external resources, thus helping
to remove a source of potential risk.

#### Java XML Resolvers

The Java XML API supports various resolvers that you can register on JDK XML
processors to resolve external resources. These resolvers includes entity resolvers
for SAX and DOM parsers, XML resolvers for StAX parsers, LSResourceResolver for validation, and URIResolver for transformation.

##### Entity Resolvers for SAX and DOM

SAX defines an interface that DOM also supports,
org.xml.sax.EntityResolver. It enables applications to step into the
entity resolution process and perform entity resolution on their own terms. The following is
the interface's definition:

```
package org.xml.sax;

public interface EntityResolver {
    public InputSource resolveEntity(String publicID, String systemID)
        throws SAXException;
}
```

You can then register an implementation of the interface on a SAX
driver:

```
    EntityResolver resolver = ...;
    SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
    factory.setNamespaceAware(true);
    XMLReader reader = factory.newSAXParser().getXMLReader();
    reader.setEntityResolver(resolver);
```

Alternatively, you can register it on a DOM builder:

```
    DocumentBuilder builder =
        DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder();
    docBuilder.setEntityResolver(resolver);
```

##### XMLResolver for StAX

StAX defines a javax.xml.stream.XMLResolver
interface:

```
package javax.xml.stream;

public interface XMLResolver {
    public Object resolveEntity(
        String publicID, String systemID,
        String baseURI, String namespace)
        throws XMLStreamException;
}
```

You can register it on a StAX factory:

```
    XMLResolver resolver = ...;
    XMLInputFactory xif = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
    xif.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.RESOLVER, resolver);
```

##### URIResolver for javax.xml.transform

The javax.xml.transform API supports custom resolution of
external resources through the URIResolver interface:

```
package javax.xml.transform;

public interface URIResolver {
    public Source resolve(String href, String base)
        throws TransformerException;
}
```

You can register an implementation of URIResolver on a
Transformer as follows:

```
    URIResolver resolver = ...;
    TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
    Transformer t =
      tf.newTransformer(new StreamSource(
        new StringReader("xsl source")));
    t.setURIResolver(resolver);
```

##### LSResourceResolver for javax.xml.validation

The javax.xml.validation API supports Document Object
Model Level 3 Load and Save (DOM LS) DOM through the LSResourceResolver
interface:

```
package org.w3c.dom.ls;

public interface LSResourceResolver {
    public LSInput resolveResource(
        String type, String namespaceURI, String publicId,
        String systemId, String baseURI);
}
```

You can register an implementation of LSResourceResolver on a
SchemaFactory as follows:

```
    SchemaFactory schemaFactory =
        SchemaFactory.newInstance("http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema");
    LSResourceResolver resolver = ...;
    schemaFactory.setResourceResolver(resolver);
```

#### The Catalog API

The XML Catalog API supports the Organization for the Advancement of Structured
Information Standards (OASIS) XML Catalogs, OASIS Standard V1.1. This API is fully
implemented by the JDK XML processors and easy to use. See [XML Catalog API](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase/13/security&id=JSCOR-GUID-96D2C9AC-641A-4BDB-BB08-9FA04358A6F4) in Java Platform, Standard Edition Core
Libraries.

Use the XML Catalog API to resolve external resources with the
CatalogResolver interface and to enable catalogs on JDK XML
processors.

##### Catalog Resolver

You can use a CatalogResolver as a custom resolver that substitutes
external references with local resources configured as Catalog
objects. You can register a CatalogResolver on factories or
processors in place of EntityResolver,
XMLResolver, URIResolver or
LSResourceResolver as described in [Java XML Resolvers](java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-EBDCA1BE-137C-4D58-916B-1BB3F27AB77D "The Java XML API supports various resolvers that you can register on JDK XML processors to resolve external resources. These resolvers includes entity resolvers for SAX and DOM parsers, XML resolvers for StAX parsers, LSResourceResolver for validation, and URIResolver for transformation."). In the following code snippet, a CatalogResolver is registered as
an EntityResolver on a SAXParserFactory:

```
    URI catalogUri = URI.create("file:///users/auser/catalog/catalog.xml")
    CatalogResolver cr =
        CatalogManager.catalogResolver(CatalogFeatures.defaults(), catalogUri);
    SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
    factory.setNamespaceAware(true);
    XMLReader reader = factory.newSAXParser().getXMLReader();
    reader.setEntityResolver(cr);
```

##### Enable Catalogs on JDK XML Processors

The JDK XML processors implement the Catalog API as a native function.
Therefore, there is no need to instantiate a CatalogResolver outside the
processors. All you need to do is register the catalog files on the XML processors through
the setProperty or setAttribute methods, through
System properties, or in the `jaxp.properties` file. The XML processors
then perform the mappings through the catalogs automatically. The following code snippet
demonstrates how to register catalogs on StAX parsers through
XMLInputFactory:

```
    String catalog = "file:///users/auser/catalog/catalog.xml";
    XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
    factory.setProperty(CatalogFeatures.Feature.FILES.getPropertyName(), catalog);
```

For more examples, see [XML Catalog API](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase/13/security&id=JSCOR-GUID-96D2C9AC-641A-4BDB-BB08-9FA04358A6F4) in Java Platform, Standard Edition Core
Libraries.

### Third-Party Parsers

The JDK will always use its system-default parser even when there's a
third-party parser on the classpath. To override the JDK system-default parser, set the
`jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser` property to true.

Table 13-16 overrideDefaultParser

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser` |
| Definition | Enables the use of a third-party's parser implementation to override the system-default parser for the JDK's Transformer, Validator, and XPath implementations. The property can be set through JAXP factories, System properties, or the `jaxp.properties` file. |
| Value | A boolean. Setting it to true enables third-party parser implementations to override the system-default implementation during XML transformation, XML validation, or XPath operations. Setting it to false disables the use of third-party parser implementations. When the value is specified as a String, the returning value will be that of Boolean.parseBoolean. |
| Default value | false |
| System property | `jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser` |
| Since | 6u181, 7u171, 8u161, 9.0.4 |

The following code snippets instruct the factories to use a third-party
parser, if found on the classpath, by setting the
`jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser` property with the
setFeature method:

```
    static final String JDK_OVERRIDE_PARSER = "jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser";
    ...
    TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
    tFactory.setFeature(JDK_OVERRIDE_PARSER, true);
    ...
    XPathFactory xf = XPathFactory.newInstance();
    xf.setFeature(JDK_OVERRIDE_PARSER, true);
    ...
    SchemaFactory schemaFactory =
        SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI);
    schemaFactory.setFeature(JDK_OVERRIDE_PARSER, true);
    ...
    Schema schema = schemaFactory.newSchema(new File("mySchema.xsd"));
    Validator validator = schema.newValidator();
    validator.setFeature(JDK_OVERRIDE_PARSER, true);

```

The following code snippet sets
`jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser` as a System property:

```
System.setProperty("jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser", "true"));
```

You can add the following line to the `jaxp.properties`
file to enable third-party parsers:

```
jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser=true
```

### General Recommendations for JAXP Security

The following are general recommendations for configuring JAXP properties and
features to help secure your applications and systems:

* Turn on Feature for Secure Processing (FSP), then adjust individual
  features and properties in accordance with your specific
  requirements.
* For processing limits, adjust them so that they are just large enough to
  accommodate the maximum amount your applications require.
* For external access restrictions, reduce or eliminate your applications'
  reliance on external resources, including the use of resolvers, then
  tighten these restrictions.
* Set up a local catalog and enable the Catalog API on all XML processors
  to further reduce your applications' reliance on external
  resources.

Table 13-17 JAXP Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| JAXP | Java API for XML Processing |
| Java SE XML API | APIs defined in the JAXP JSR and integrated into Java SE |
| Java XML API | Equivalent term for Java SE XML API |
| Java XML Features and Properties | XML-related features and properties defined by the Java SE specification |
| java.xml | The [java.xml](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.xml/module-summary.html) module |
| JDK XML | The JDK implementation of the Java XML API |
| JDK XML Parsers | The JDK implementation of the XML parsers |
| JDK XML Properties | The JDK Implementation-only properties |
| FSP | `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` |

### Appendix B: Java and JDK XML Features and Properties Naming Convention

Java and JDK XML features and properties are defined in the javax.xml.XMLConstants class. The features have a prefix
`http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature`; the properties,
`http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property`. If there is a corresponding
System property, its prefix is `javax.xml`.

The JDK XML properties are JDK implementation-only properties. The prefix of
the properties is `http://www.oracle.com` for JDK 8 and earlier and
`jdk.xml` for JDK 9 and later. The following table summarizes this
naming convention:

Table 13-18 Java and JDK XML Features and Properties Naming Convention

| Scope | API Property Prefix | System Property Prefix | Java SE and JDK Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Java SE | `http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature`  `http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property` | `javax.xml` | Since 1.4 |
| JDK | `http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties` | `jdk.xml` | Since 7 |
| JDK | `jdk.xml` | `jdk.xml` | Since 9 |

|  |  | = Java System Properties Affecting Ivy |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | == XML Parser Settings |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Starting with Ivy 2.5.2 Ivy's XML parser can be controlled via the use |
|  |  | of two newly introduced system properties. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you want to restore the default behavior of Ivy 2.5.1 and earlier |
|  |  | you need to set `ivy.xml.allow-doctype-processing` to `true` and |
|  |  | `ivy.xml.external-resources` to `ALL`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | === `ivy.xml.allow-doctype-processing` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This system property accepts `true` or `false` as values. When set to |
|  |  | `false` Ivy will not allow any processing of doctype declarations at |
|  |  | all, while setting it to `true` enables it. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The default is to allow doctype processing if and only if Ivy is |
|  |  | parsing a Maven POM file. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | === `ivy.xml.external-resources` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This system property controls if external resources are read during |
|  |  | doctype processing - and if so, where they can be loadad from. The |
|  |  | value of this system property is only ever used if |
|  |  | `ivy.xml.allow-doctype-processing` is not `false`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The accepted values are |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* `PROHIBIT` makes Ivy fail if any doctype tries to load an external |
|  |  | resource. |
|  |  | \* `IGNORE` makes Ivy ignore any external resource that the doctype |
|  |  | declaration wants to load. |
|  |  | \* `LOCAL\_ONLY` allows external resources to be loaded via `file:` or |
|  |  | `jar:file` URIs only. |
|  |  | \* `ALL` allows external resources to be loaded from any URI. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The default behavior is to not allow doctype processing at all, but if |
|  |  | it is enabled the value `PROHIBIT` is assumed unless the property has |
|  |  | been set explicitly. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When reading Maven POMs a specific internal system id is recognized as |
|  |  | resource and will be loaded from a resource shipping with the Ivy |
|  |  | distribution in order to deal with invalid POM files accepted by |
|  |  | Apache Maven - and the default value for this property is |
|  |  | `IGNORE`in that case. See |
|  |  | link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY-921[IVY-921] for |
|  |  | details. |

Thanks for these fixe

[src/java/org/apache/ivy/util/XMLHelper.java](https://github.com/apache/ant-ivy/commit/2be17bc18b0e1d4123007d579e43ba1a4b6fab3d#diff-9232666cd01a28cd45ce5f9c4373f3577f435a924366e652093234395da05195) l93 :

Unfortunately, this affectation is a problem when XMLreader don't use this property (ex : javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory) : this throws the exception org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException.

You should write this code like trySetAttribute l402

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hy Stefan,
Is it possible to release Ivy 2.5.3 with this fix ? Version 2.5.2, which fixes many CVEs, is unusable in our contexts without this fix.
Thanks.
