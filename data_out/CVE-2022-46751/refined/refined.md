Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that older versions of the Ivy Plugin bundle vulnerable versions of Apache Ivy. Specifically, these versions of Apache Ivy are susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the presence of an XXE vulnerability in the bundled Apache Ivy library. This means that the XML parser used by Ivy is not configured to prevent the inclusion of external entities within XML documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the Jenkins controller's file system.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can potentially use the vulnerability to initiate server-side request forgery, where the Jenkins server makes requests to attacker-controlled external servers, potentially revealing internal services or infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Control of Input File:** The primary attack vector requires an attacker to have control over the input file used by the "Trigger the build of other projects based on the Ivy dependency management system" post-build step. This means that if an attacker can provide a malicious XML file to be processed by Ivy, they can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input XML file that is used by the Ivy post-build step. This implies having some level of access to Jenkins configuration or the build process configuration.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   The provided content includes a commit message from the Apache Ant-Ivy project that addresses the vulnerability. This commit message highlights the fix which involves disabling doctype parsing and preventing access to external entities by default.
*   The commit also includes the introduction of system properties that can be used to configure the XML parsing behavior of Ivy, specifically:
    *   `ivy.xml.allow-doctype-processing`: Determines if doctype declarations are allowed during parsing (default is true for Maven POMs only, otherwise false).
    *   `ivy.xml.external-resources`: Controls if and from where external resources are loaded during doctype processing (if enabled), it accepts `PROHIBIT`, `IGNORE`, `LOCAL_ONLY`, or `ALL` values.
*   The content also includes a link to a document that provides extensive guidance on mitigating XML-related vulnerabilities such as XXE attacks, suggesting best practices and configurations to prevent exploitation, including:
    *   Feature for Secure Processing (FSP).
    *   JAXP properties for processing limits.
    *   JAXP properties for external access restrictions.
    *   Use of resolvers and catalogs.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-46751 in the Ivy Plugin is caused by a vulnerable version of Apache Ivy that is susceptible to XXE injection. An attacker able to control the input file of the Ivy plugin can potentially extract sensitive information from the Jenkins controller or perform SSRF. This vulnerability has been addressed by disabling doctype processing and external entity access by default in Apache Ivy version 2.5.2 or higher and providing the functionality to re-enable them via system properties.
