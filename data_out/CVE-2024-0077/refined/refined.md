Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-0077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The NVIDIA Virtual GPU (vGPU) Manager has a vulnerability in its vGPU plugin. This vulnerability stems from the fact that the plugin allows a guest operating system (OS) to allocate resources that it is not authorized to access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper authorization control, specifically allowing unauthorized resource allocation from guest OS. This is related to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Code execution
    - Denial of service
    - Escalation of privileges
    - Information disclosure
    - Data tampering

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L) because the attacker needs to have access to a guest OS running on a system with the vulnerable NVIDIA vGPU Manager.
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L), meaning a user in the guest OS can trigger the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N)
- The vulnerability scope is unchanged (S:U)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a guest OS that is running on a system using the vulnerable NVIDIA vGPU Manager. They need to be able to execute commands within that guest OS.
