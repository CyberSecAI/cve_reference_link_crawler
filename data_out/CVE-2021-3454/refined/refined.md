- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `l2cap_chan_le_recv()` function where the length of the buffer is not checked before accessing the SDU length field. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when processing a truncated L2CAP K-frame.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper input validation leading to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-130).
    - Assertion failure due to accessing invalid data (CWE-617).
- **Impact of exploitation:** If assertions are enabled, the system will halt due to assertion failure. If assertions are disabled, the SDU length is calculated incorrectly, and the packet is dropped due to invalid SDU length. This can lead to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a specially crafted L2CAP K-frame with a truncated SDU length field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be within the adjacent network (e.g., Bluetooth range) to send the malicious L2CAP K-frame.
