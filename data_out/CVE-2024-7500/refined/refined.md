Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of file type validation in the `save_settings` method within the `admin/admin_class.php` file of the Airline Reservation System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system does not validate the type of file being uploaded.
- Missing file extension restrictions: The application does not check the file extension, allowing arbitrary file types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file, which can then be executed by the webserver, leading to complete system compromise.
- Arbitrary code execution on the server: The attacker can execute arbitrary system commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: A specifically crafted POST request to `/admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings` is used to upload the malicious PHP file as a form data element.
- The attack can be performed over the network, likely by an authenticated admin user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the admin panel, which requires administrative credentials.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The `save_settings` method in `admin/admin_class.php` is used for file uploads.
- The vulnerability occurs because the system doesn't check the file type during upload.
- The Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates uploading a `shell.php` file containing `<?php eval($_POST["cmd"]);?>` to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- The PoC uses a multipart/form-data request with the malicious PHP code placed in the `img` field with the filename `shell.php`.
