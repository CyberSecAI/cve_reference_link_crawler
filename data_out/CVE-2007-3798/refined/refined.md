{
  "cveId": "CVE-2007-3798",
  "description": "An un-checked return value in the BGP dissector code can result in an integer overflow. This value is used in subsequent buffer management operations, resulting in a stack based buffer overflow under certain circumstances.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "An integer overflow occurs due to an unchecked return value from snprintf in the BGP dissector code. This overflow leads to incorrect buffer size calculations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Stack-based Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper input validation",
       "Use of potentially unsafe function (snprintf) without proper bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted BGP packets, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running tcpdump or a denial of service (crash of the tcpdump process).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network",
      "Remote"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the target system.  Crafted BGP packets are required to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "position": "Attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered through network traffic. No specific system access is required before the attack."
