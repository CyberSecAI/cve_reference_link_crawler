How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-07:06.tcpdump Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Buffer overflow in tcpdump(1)
Category: contrib
Module: tcpdump
Announced: 2007-08-01
Credits: "mu-b"
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD
Corrected: 2007-08-01 20:42:48 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.2-STABLE)
2007-08-01 20:44:58 UTC (RELENG\_6\_2, 6.2-RELEASE-p7)
2007-08-01 20:45:49 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p19)
2007-08-01 20:47:13 UTC (RELENG\_5, 5.5-STABLE)
2007-08-01 20:48:19 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p15)
CVE Name: CVE-2007-3798
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
Tcpdump is a commonly used network diagnostic utility which decodes packets
received on the wire into human readable format.
II. Problem Description
An un-checked return value in the BGP dissector code can result in an integer
overflow. This value is used in subsequent buffer management operations,
resulting in a stack based buffer overflow under certain circumstances.
III. Impact
By crafting malicious BGP packets, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability
to execute code or crash the tcpdump process on the target system. This
code would be executed in the context of the user running tcpdump(1).
It should be noted that tcpdump(1) requires privileges in order to open live
network interfaces.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_6\_2, RELENG\_6\_1, or RELENG\_5\_5 security branch dated after the
correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
and 6.2 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:06/tcpdump.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:06/tcpdump.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

More details about this issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3798  Here are the details from the Slackware 12.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/tcpdump-3.9.7-i486-1_slack12.0.tgz:   Upgraded to libpcap-0.9.7, tcpdump-3.9.7.   This new version fixes an integer overflow in the BGP dissector which   could possibly allow remote attackers to crash tcpdump or to execute   arbitrary code.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# tcpdump: Integer overflow — GLSA **200707-14**

A vulnerability has been discovered in tcpdump, allowing for the execution
of arbitrary code, possibly with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/tcpdump** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.9.5-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.9.5-r3** |

### Background

tcpdump is a tool for capturing and inspecting network traffic.

### Description

mu-b from Digital Labs discovered that the return value of a snprintf()
call is not properly checked before being used. This could lead to an
integer overflow.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted BGP packets on a network
being monitored with tcpdump, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running tcpdump, which
is usually root.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All tcpdump users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/tcpdump-3.9.5-r3"
```
### References

| [Description](#c0)  mu-b    2007-07-10 10:16:03 UTC  ``` The return value of a call to snprintf is not sanitized before being used in an addition to calculate the number of bytes remaining the buffer within a loop. The result is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow since the length calculation will eventually underflow and thus make the length parameter of subsequent snprintf calls irrelevant.   mu-b@mu-b ~ $ sudo gdb /usr/sbin/tcpdump GNU gdb 6.6 Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

The last question I have, did anybody reported this upstream? What upstream say on the issue. Before stabilization, personally I'd like to hear them... This bug seems to be open thus, I'll ask their opinion in tcpdump-workers. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-11 20:04:10 UTC  ``` hi arches, please stable tcpdump-0.9.5-r3. thx! ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-11 20:05:07 UTC  ``` hi arches, please stable tcpdump-0.9.5-r3. thx!(In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=184815#c3)) > hi arches, please stable tcpdump-0.9.5-r3. thx! >   bah, i'm out of training :/ ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-11 20:20:09 UTC  ``` Stabilize tcpdump-3.9.5-r3, and it should be open no?  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-11 20:42:47 UTC  ``` sparc stable for 3.9.5-r3.  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-11 21:44:51 UTC  ``` alpha/ia64/x86 stable, thanks Tobias ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-12 17:36:41 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Steve Dibb (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-13 00:40:26 UTC  ``` net-analyzer/tcpdump-3.9.5-r3 amd64 stable ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-15 20:47:50 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Joshua Kinard   gentoo-dev  2007-07-16 03:56:59 UTC  ``` mips stable. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-16 08:25:42 UTC  ``` Upstream unswered:  "I reviewed the fix - it seemed a bit cleaner to have it continue  processing the TLVs, without adding to the string, if the string buffer  is full."

Package        : tcpdump
Vulnerability  : integer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-3798

It was discovered that an integer overflow in the BGP dissector of tcpdump,
a powerful tool for network monitoring and data acquisition, may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.3-5sarge3.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.5-2etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.5-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
