# tcpdump: Integer overflow — GLSA **200707-14**

A vulnerability has been discovered in tcpdump, allowing for the execution
of arbitrary code, possibly with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/tcpdump** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.9.5-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.9.5-r3** |

### Background

tcpdump is a tool for capturing and inspecting network traffic.

### Description

mu-b from Digital Labs discovered that the return value of a snprintf()
call is not properly checked before being used. This could lead to an
integer overflow.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted BGP packets on a network
being monitored with tcpdump, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running tcpdump, which
is usually root.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All tcpdump users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/tcpdump-3.9.5-r3"
```
