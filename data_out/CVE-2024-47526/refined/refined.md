Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the "name" field when creating an alert template within the LibreNMS interface. Although the application strips HTML tags before storing the template name in the database, it fails to sanitize the name before it is rendered in the alert template table in the UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Self-XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The primary vulnerability is a Self-XSS, where malicious JavaScript can be injected into the "name" field of an alert template. This script executes when the template is created due to the use of `bootgrid` which does not sanitize the input before rendering the table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The injected JavaScript executes within the user's browser session immediately upon submitting the alert template form, allowing unauthorized actions or data exposure within that session. This is self-XSS since the script doesn't persist after page refresh.
- The vulnerability could be used for social engineering to trick users into performing actions or disclosing information, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data access within the user's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is through the LibreNMS web interface. An authenticated user must create or modify an alert template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as a LibreNMS user with global admin privileges.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires the user to input malicious JavaScript into the "Name" field during alert template creation or modification, and submit the form.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the newly created or modified template is added to the table within the web interface. The `bootgrid` function used for rendering this table does not sanitize the name field before displaying it, allowing for the execution of the injected script.
- Sanitization is performed when data is stored in the database (`strip_tags`), but not before being displayed in the UI, which is where the vulnerability is exposed.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) payload is `test1<script>{onerror=alert}throw 1337</script>`.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by applying `htmlentities` to the `$status` and `$message` before being passed to `json_encode`. Also, the alert template name is being sanitized before being added to the table.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-47526
