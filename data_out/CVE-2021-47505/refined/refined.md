{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The aio poll implementation was missing handling for the POLLFREE notification, which is used when a waitqueue's lifetime is tied to the current task and is being freed. This can occur with signalfd_poll() and binder_poll(). When the waitqueue is freed early, a use-after-free can occur if an aio poll request is still referencing it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by using aio poll on a signalfd or binder fd and then causing the associated waitqueue to be freed while the aio poll is still active.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create and use signalfd or binder file descriptors, and the ability to initiate aio polls."
