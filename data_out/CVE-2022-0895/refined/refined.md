Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `contactInformationSave` function within the `ContactInformationTrait.php` file. The code uses `strip_tags()` to sanitize user input for 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', and 'phone' before saving it in the session. However, it saves the original, unsanitized input values in the session too by using `$request->get()`, which leads to a bypass of the sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Bypassed Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the inconsistent handling of user input. While the code attempts to sanitize data before storing it into the `$firstName`, `$lastName`, `$email`, and `$phone` variables, it also includes the original unsanitized values from `$request->get()` into the session. This bypass enables injection of malicious data despite using `strip_tags()`.
- **Session Data Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious data into the session. This data is stored unsanitized allowing for various malicious activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code through input fields, an attacker could perform XSS attacks, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.
- **Session Poisoning:** Modifying session data can lead to various issues such as unauthorized access or manipulation of user's checkout data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the form submission to the `contactInformationSave` function.
- An attacker can manipulate the 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', or 'phone' input fields on a form associated with the checkout process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have access to the form used in the checkout process.
-   The attacker needs to be able to submit POST requests to the `contactInformationSave` endpoint.
-   No specific user privileges are needed other than the ability to interact with the form.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit diff highlights the fix: the original lines are using `$request->get()` to grab the unsanitized values. The new lines use the sanitized values, `$firstName`, `$lastName`, `$email`, and `$phone`, for the session.
