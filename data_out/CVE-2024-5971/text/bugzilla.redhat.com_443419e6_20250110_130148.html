| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-06-13 13:56:06 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Undertow. Undertow chunked response hangs after the body was flushed. The response headers and body were sent but the client would continue waiting as Undertow does not send the expected 0\r\n termination of the chunked response. This results in an uncontrolled resource consumption leaving the server side to a Denial of Service vulnerability attack. This happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-08 22:19:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2024:4392 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4392](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4392)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-25 19:26:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.1 for Spring Boot  Via RHSA-2024:4884 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4884](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4884)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-08 17:22:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:5145 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5145](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5145)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-08 17:23:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:5143 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5143](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5143)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-08 17:23:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:5144 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5144](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5144)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-08 17:25:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2024:5147 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5147](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5147)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c9)  Andreaa Ferrason    2024-08-28 07:14:41 UTC  ``` When dealing with issues related to Undertow's response write hanging in the context of Java 17 and TLSv1.3's NewSessionTicket, you might be encountering a complex problem that involves the interaction between the web server (Undertow)  <https://geometrydashbreeze.org>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 16:46:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Apache Camel 3.20.7 for Spring Boot  Via RHSA-2024:6883 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6883](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6883)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c11)  rogavis934    2025-01-03 18:40:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:5144 <https://troubleshoot.dev/> <https://latestmerch.com/> <https://programable/>  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5144](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5144)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2292211#c12)  rogavis934    2025-01-03 18:43:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:5144 <https://troubleshoot.dev/> <https://latestmerch.com/> <https://programable.com/>  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5144](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5144)   ``` |  |
