- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Page Layout" feature of ZenarioCMS v.9.4.59197.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user accesses the affected web page, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, session hijacking, or other malicious activities within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious script and injects it into the Page Layout configuration. The injected script is then stored and executed when other users access the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the administration panel of ZenarioCMS to be able to modify the Page Layout.
