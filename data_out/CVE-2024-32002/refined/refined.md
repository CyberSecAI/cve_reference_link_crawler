  "CVE-2024-32002": {
    "description": "Repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed.",
    "root_cause": "Case-insensitive filesystems, combined with symbolic links, allow for a directory created during the clone operation to be replaced with a symbolic link to the `.git/` directory. This enables writing hooks into the `.git/` directory which get executed during the clone.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Path traversal (writing outside the intended submodule worktree)",
       "Arbitrary code execution via maliciously crafted git hooks"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution during the clone operation, before user inspection, potentially compromising the user's system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cloning a malicious repository with crafted submodules.",
      "Exploiting case-insensitive file systems and symlinks."
    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious repository, including malicious submodule configuration and hooks." ,
    "patches": [
      "The problem has been patched in the versions published on Tuesday, May 14th, 2024: v2.45.1 v2.44.1 v2.43.4 v2.42.2 v2.41.1 v2.40.2 v2.39.4"
    ],
    "workarounds": [
       "Disabling symbolic link support in Git (`git config --global core.symlinks false`).",
      "Avoiding cloning repositories from untrusted sources."
