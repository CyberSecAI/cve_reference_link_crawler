Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the `login1.php` page of the "Project Expense Monitoring System" version 1.0. Specifically, the username parameter, passed via a POST request, is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection. The application uses the `mysqli_query` method to execute SQL queries, and it directly incorporates the user-supplied username into the query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user credentials, financial data, and other confidential information.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can use SQLi to bypass the login authentication by injecting SQL statements that always return true, allowing them to log in with arbitrary credentials. This is achieved in the proof of concept using a universal password.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `login1.php` page.
*   **`user` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `user` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft malicious SQL queries.
*   **Ability to Send POST Requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is time-based, meaning the attacker can infer the result of the SQL injection by the time the query takes to execute.
*   The specific payload used in the provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function:

    ```
    user=admin' AND (SELECT 5289 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))cTae) AND 'rmay'='rmay&pass=123
    ```
*   This payload attempts to inject SQL code to cause a 5-second delay. If successful, it confirms the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The exploit uses `admin'` in an attempt to inject malicious code after the username, which is then used in the SQL query.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided information indicates the software is named "Project Expense Monitoring System" version 1.0 by vendor itsourcecode.
* The vulnerability was found in `login1.php`, the login authentication page.
* The analysis mentions that while the input string is filtered to prevent XSS attacks, it is not adequate to prevent SQL injection.

In summary, the content clearly describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Project Expense Monitoring System due to insufficient input sanitization of the username parameter in the login functionality. The vulnerability can lead to sensitive information disclosure, authentication bypass, and arbitrary access to the application.
