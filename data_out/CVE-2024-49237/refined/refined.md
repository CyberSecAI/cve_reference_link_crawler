- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Ahmeti Wp Timeline plugin for WordPress versions 5.1 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications, data breaches, or other malicious activity, depending on the functionality of the vulnerable actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request initiated by an attacker. The attacker relies on a logged-in user with sufficient permissions to inadvertently trigger the forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into executing it. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated on the target system themselves. The attacker could deliver the malicious request via malicious links, scripts or websites.
