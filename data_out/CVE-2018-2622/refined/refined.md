Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-2622:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unspecified issue within the DDL (Data Definition Language) component of the MySQL server. This means that the way MySQL handles commands that define database structures (like creating tables or indexes) is flawed.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core weakness lies in the lack of proper validation or sanitization of DDL statements before they are processed by the MySQL server.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The most common impact across the provided documents is a **Denial of Service (DoS)**. This can manifest as a server hang or a frequently repeatable crash, making the MySQL server unavailable for normal use.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is primarily **network-based (AV:N)** meaning it can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   The vulnerability is exposed through the MySQL protocol.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send commands to the MySQL server.
*   Based on the CVSS vector, a **low privilege** user (PR:L) is needed.
* No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Additional Details and Notes:**

*   **NetApp Advisory (NTAP-20180117-0002):** This advisory notes that multiple NetApp products incorporate vulnerable versions of Oracle MySQL. Exploitation could lead to unauthorized takeover of the MySQL server, unauthorized access to data, or DoS. NetApp provides patches for affected products like Active IQ Unified Manager, OnCommand Insight, OnCommand Workflow Automation, and SnapCenter.
*   **Debian Security Advisories (DLA 1250-1 and DSA 4091-1):** Debian highlights that this vulnerability affects `mysql-5.5` and `mariadb-10.0`, and provides updated packages to address the issue.
*  **Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA-2018:0587, RHSA-2019:1258, RHSA-2018:2439, RHSA-2018:0586):** These advisories indicate that the vulnerability is found in `rh-mysql56-mysql` and `rh-mariadb102-mariadb` packages, and provide updated packages for Red Hat Software Collections, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*   **Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory (January 2018):** This Oracle advisory states that versions of MySQL Server 5.5.58 and prior, 5.6.38 and prior, and 5.7.20 and prior are affected by CVE-2018-2622 and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Ubuntu Security Notices (USN-3537-1 and USN-3537-2):** Ubuntu also includes this vulnerability among other MySQL security issues they patched, across several supported versions (17.10, 16.04, 14.04 and 12.04 ESM).

In summary, CVE-2018-2622 is a moderate-severity vulnerability in the DDL processing of MySQL, which can lead to a DoS attack by an attacker with low-level privileges, and is remotely exploitable. Patches were released by various vendors to address it.
