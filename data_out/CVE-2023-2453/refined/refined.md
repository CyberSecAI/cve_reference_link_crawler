Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2453:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient sanitization of file names within the "Forum" Infusion, specifically when constructing paths passed to `require_once`. This allows for the inclusion of arbitrary files with the `.php` extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The vulnerability allows for the inclusion of local files, as attacker-controlled input is concatenated into a path and then passed to a `require_once` statement.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** File names are not properly sanitized before being used in the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker can upload a malicious `.php` file to the server with a known absolute path, this vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.
- **Information Disclosure:** While not directly mentioned, the ability to include arbitrary files may also lead to information disclosure if the attacker includes files that contain sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to a specific endpoint in the "Forum" Infusion with a vulnerable parameter containing directory traversal sequences.
- **File Inclusion:** By using directory traversal sequences such as `../`, the attacker can navigate to and include arbitrary `.php` files on the system, which are then executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with "Member", "Administrator", or "Super Administrator" privileges to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know the absolute path of the target `.php` file on the server.
- **Ability to Upload Files:** To achieve RCE, the attacker also needs some other way to upload a malicious .php file onto the server in an attacker-controlled location.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory mentions that there is no known method within PHPFusion for an attacker to directly upload a `.php` file. This means the attacker would need to leverage other vulnerabilities or methods to achieve RCE.
- A CVSS score of 8.3 is given, indicating a high severity.
- The vulnerability exists in PHPFusion 9.10.30 and earlier versions.
- There is currently no patch for this vulnerability, the recommended mitigation is to disable the "Forum" Infusion, or implement a web application firewall.
