Based on the provided commit message "Fixed XSS security holes in JS/PHP.", and the code diffs, this commit addresses Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML. This allows malicious scripts to be injected into web pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically:
*   **Unescaped output:** The code directly outputs user-provided strings (e.g., `sentence_data['Sentence']`, `pageTitle`) into HTML without escaping them. This allows injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through input fields or parameters, which can:
*   Steal user cookies and session data.
*   Redirect users to phishing sites.
*   Modify the content of the web page.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through any input field or parameter that is subsequently displayed on the web page without proper escaping. For example:
*   `Sentence` data fetched from the database and displayed in `linker.php`
*   `pageTitle` when displaying and editing pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to inject data into the system, typically by:
*   Being able to edit page content
*   Manipulating query parameters or POST data.
*   Having access to user input fields.

**Code changes that mitigate the XSS Vulnerability**
The primary method to fix the XSS vulnerability is to use `htmlspecialchars` to encode the output.  This method converts special characters to HTML entities.

Specifically, the following changes were made:

*   `Source/NeoXplora.com/controller/browse/linker.php`:
    *   `"Sentence" => htmlspecialchars($sentence_data['Sentence'], ENT_QUOTES),` added to properly encode output

*   `Source/NeoXplora.com/controller/train/interpreter.php`:
    *    `'pageTitle' => htmlspecialchars($pageTitle, ENT_QUOTES),` added to properly encode output

*  `Source/NeoXplora.com/controller/train/linker.php`:
    *  `"Sentence" => htmlspecialchars($sentence_data[Entity\TSentence::$tok_name], ENT_QUOTES),` added to properly encode output
    *  `'pageTitle' => htmlspecialchars($pageTitle, ENT_QUOTES)` added to properly encode output

*   `Source/NeoXplora.com/controller/train/splitter.php`
    *   `'pageTitle' => htmlspecialchars($pageTitle, ENT_QUOTES)` added to properly encode output

The changes in `Source/NeoXplora.com/js/module/interpreter/browse/index.js` and `Source/NeoXplora.com/js/module/splitter/review/index.js` address minor issues in form elements not directly related to the XSS vulnerability but are improvements related to user input.
