CVE-2024-50020

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper reference count handling in the `ice_sriov_set_msix_vec_count()` function within the Intel ICE driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The function `ice_sriov_set_msix_vec_count()` increments the reference count of a virtual function (VF) pointer using `ice_get_vf_by_id()`. However, it fails to decrement this reference count using `ice_put_vf(vf)` in two specific error scenarios, leading to a reference count leak:
1. When `ice_get_vf_vsi()` fails and returns `NULL`.
2. When `ice_sriov_get_irqs()` returns a negative value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A reference count leak can eventually lead to resource exhaustion and potential instability of the system. While not directly exploitable for arbitrary code execution, this can cause denial of service by consuming available memory.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to trigger the error conditions within the `ice_sriov_set_msix_vec_count()` function repeatedly. This could involve manipulating the MSI-X vector count settings for virtual functions of the Intel ICE network adapter in such a way that the error conditions are triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the network device settings, and specifically the ability to change the MSI-X vector count for virtual functions. This implies the attacker would likely need administrative or root-level privileges within the system or have control over a virtualized environment to configure the virtual functions.
