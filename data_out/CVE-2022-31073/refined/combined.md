# Edge ServiceBus module: DoS by exhausting memory of node with http request containing large body

Moderate

[kevin-wangzefeng](/kevin-wangzefeng)
published
GHSA-vwm6-qc77-v2rh
Jul 11, 2022

## Package

gomod

KubeEdge
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=1.11.0, 1.10.1, 1.9.3

## Patched versions

1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4

## Description

### Impact

The ServiceBus server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it.

It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service.

Malicious Apps which by accident pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml` as below:

```
modules:
  ...
  serviceBus:
    enable: true

```
### Patches

This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

### Workarounds

Disable the ServiceBus module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.

### References

NA

### Credits

Thanks David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [kubeedge security policy](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/policy) during a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [KubeEdge repo](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/issues/new/choose)
* To make a vulnerability report, email your vulnerability to the private cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io list with the security details and the details expected for [KubeEdge bug reports](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID
