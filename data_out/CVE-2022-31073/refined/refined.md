{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ServiceBus server on the edge side does not properly limit the size of the HTTP request body, leading to potential memory exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper input validation and resource management when handling HTTP request bodies."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious actor can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a large HTTP request body to the ServiceBus server, exhausting the node's memory. This can prevent other services running on the same node (e.g., other containers) from allocating memory, effectively rendering the node unusable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious apps with network access to the edge node's ServiceBus (typically localhost) can send crafted HTTP requests with oversized bodies."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the edge node, typically on the localhost interface if the service is not exposed externally. This could be achieved if the attacker has a malicious application running on the same host as the KubeEdge service. The ServiceBus module must be enabled in the edgecore.yaml config file"
