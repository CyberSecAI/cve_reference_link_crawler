**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Planet IGS-4215-16T2S industrial switch's web interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page which crafts a CSRF attack request to the vulnerable device's web interface.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the switch directly, but needs to target a user that is.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in firmware version 1.305b210528 of the Planet IGS-4215-16T2S industrial switch.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in firmware version 1.305b231218.
