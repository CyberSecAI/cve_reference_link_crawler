Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation when loading crafted JXR files. Specifically, the program fails to handle unsupported content, leading to an access violation due to an invalid write operation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The code attempts to write a value to a memory location calculated based on the input file's content, but does not validate if the pointer is valid, leading to the crash.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). The program crashes and becomes unusable.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Opening a specially crafted JXR file using BandiView.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious JXR file and trick the user into opening it with BandiView.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient verification of PSD files, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  Lack of proper bounds checking when processing PSD files allowing an attacker to write past the buffer, leading to overwriting stack memory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Buffer overflow, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), program crashes and unpredictable behavior.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Opening a crafted PSD file using BandiView.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PSD file.

**Vulnerability 3**

*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient verification of PSD files leading to an access violation when trying to write to an invalid memory location.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The code attempts to write to a memory location calculated based on the input file's content, but the memory location is invalid.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). The program crashes and becomes unusable.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Opening a specially crafted PSD file using BandiView.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PSD file.

The provided content gives more details than a typical CVE description, including:

*   Specific vulnerable functions (`sub_0x3d80fc` for Vulnerability 1).
*   Assembly code snippets showing the vulnerable code.
*   Crash dumps and Windbg analysis.
*   Detailed steps to reproduce the issue.
*   Explanation of the exploitation scenario.
*   Mitigation suggestions.

It's important to note that all three vulnerabilities involve improper input validation when parsing image files, leading to denial-of-service or potential RCE conditions. The common theme is that the software does not properly handle malicious inputs, resulting in program crashes or other unexpected behavior.
