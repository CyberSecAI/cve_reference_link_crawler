Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the LyLme\_spage v1.9.5 application. Specifically, the application fails to properly filter user-supplied data in the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
*   **Bypass of Input Filters:** Although the application implements some filters, the attacker can bypass them by using techniques such as `concat_ws` instead of `group_concat`, and using `%23xxxx%0a` to bypass `select` keyword filters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including table names, user credentials, and other stored data.
*   **Database Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Database Structure Discovery:** Through techniques like using the sleep function and modified `LIMIT` parameters, the attacker can probe the database structure, potentially identifying other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific admin pages, specifically:
    *   `/admin/tag.php`
    *   `/admin/apply.php`
    *   `/admin/sou.php`
*   The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `id` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication is explicitly required for exploiting the vulnerability.

**Specific details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Version:** LyLme\_spage v1.9.5
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The `id` parameter in `/admin/tag.php`, `/admin/apply.php` and `/admin/sou.php`
*   **Bypassed filters:** The application attempts to filter SQL keywords but can be bypassed.
*  **Exploitation techniques:**
    *   Use of `concat_ws` instead of `group_concat` to bypass filter.
    *   Use of  `%23xxxx%0a` to bypass `select` keyword filter.
    *   Using `LIMIT` to enumerate database tables
    *   Use of `sleep()` function for time-based SQL injection
