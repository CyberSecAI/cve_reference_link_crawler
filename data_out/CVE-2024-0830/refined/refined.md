Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The "Comments Extra Fields For Post,Pages and CPT" WordPress plugin, in versions 5.0 and below, is vulnerable to CSRF due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several AJAX actions. Specifically, the `wpcomment_save_settings` action was missing nonce validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing or Incorrect Nonce Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate nonces for certain AJAX actions, allowing an attacker to forge requests. Specifically, the `wpcomment_save_settings` function lacked nonce verification.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The absence of proper nonce validation makes the plugin susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Modification of Comment Form Fields:** An attacker could modify comment form fields.
*   **Update of Plugin Settings:** An attacker could modify the plugin's settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Forged HTTP Requests:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that targets a vulnerable AJAX action of the plugin.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a site administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link) that triggers the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an administrator into clicking a link or performing some action to trigger the forged request.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.1 of the plugin by adding nonce verification to the `save_form_settings` function.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 5.0.
*   The function `save_meta_fields` has nonce validation, while `save_form_settings` did not prior to the fix.
*   The plugin uses AJAX actions to handle form submissions, which were susceptible to CSRF.
