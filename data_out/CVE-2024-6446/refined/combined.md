# User Application can spoof the redirect url in the new trust screen

## Report

#### Summary

This is a bit of an odd one, but as I found it I thought I could just report it.

There is a new design for OAuth permission prompts when using Gitlab.com as an OAuth provider. When registering an application, you have to add a `redirect URI`. This is the URL that the user will end up on with the `code` after accepting the requested access scope for the application.

When visiting the permission prompt gitlab will show an orange box that will inform the user what URL that is trusted

[![Screenshot_2024-06-25_at_00.15.00.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/96a404b5ee0ab623c16a3cfe60ea594f0384388d/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f66356238613939332d363030662d343932382d383439612d6263376434633439393464342f53637265656e73686f745f323032342d30362d32355f61745f30302e31352e30302e706e67)

The issue here is that there is a small normalization in the template `haml` code

```
domain = URI.parse([@]pre_auth.redirect_uri).host.gsub('www.', '')
```

As you can see, the code will first extract the `host` correctly and safely using a proper URI parser. But after the host is extracted `www.` will get stripped globally in the `host`. This allows an attacker to register an application with a redirect URI like this `https://gwww.itlab.com` that will be shown as `gitlab.com` in the UI

The issue here is that users are meant to trust the UI that the `host` is the recipient of the trust that is given. By spoofing this URL, an attacker can trick a victim into giving the attacker permission to access the victim's account.

the gitlab `scope page` has this out of scope line

> HTML or text injection is eligible only when significant impact can be achieved with minimal user interaction

I think that this affected page is significant enough to make this a vulnerability.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to <https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications>
2. Click `add new application`
3. Fill out the form and make sure to add `https://giwww.tlab.com` as the redirect URL and scope `api`
4. Create the app, and copy the app ID
5. Use the ID in this link

```
https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=APP_ID&redirect_uri=https://giwww.tlab.com&response_type=code&state=adf&scope=api
```

6. The UI will tell you that the redirect is to `gitlab.com`
7. Click `Authorize`. And see that you end up on `giwww.tlab.com`

[![Screenshot_2024-06-25_at_00.04.06.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/38af9952782d8cba0c04f709d885fead6fd35612/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f39613636316136382d313362342d343066662d616264332d3564363637333437366562322f53637265656e73686f745f323032342d30362d32355f61745f30302e30342e30362e706e67)

#### Impact

Spoofing redirect URL can trick a victim to give trust to an untrusted attacker application

#### What is the current *bug* behavior?

the `host` value is altered with an unsafe replace function

#### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

the UI should be trustworthy

#### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

#### Impact

Spoofing redirect URL can trick a victim to give trust to an untrusted attacker application

# GitLab Critical Patch Release: 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7

Learn more about GitLab Critical Patch Release: 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Today we are releasing versions 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important bug and security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all self-managed GitLab installations be upgraded to
one of these versions immediately. GitLab.com is already running the patched version. GitLab Dedicated customers do not need to take action.

GitLab releases fixes for vulnerabilities in patch releases. There are two types of patch releases:
scheduled releases, and ad-hoc critical patches for high-severity vulnerabilities. Scheduled releases are released twice a month on the second and fourth Wednesdays.
For more information, you can visit our [releases handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/) and [security FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/).
You can see all of GitLab release blog posts [here](/releases/categories/releases/).

For security fixes, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=closed&label_name%5B%5D=bug%3A%3Avulnerability&confidential=no&first_page_size=100)
30 days after the release in which they were patched.

We are committed to ensuring all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to
the highest security standards. As part of maintaining good security hygiene, it is highly recommended that all customers
upgrade to the latest patch release for their supported version. You can read more
[best practices in securing your GitLab instance](/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/) in our blog post.

### Recommended Action

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are **upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible**.

When no specific deployment type (omnibus, source code, helm chart, etc.) of a product is mentioned, this means all types are affected.
