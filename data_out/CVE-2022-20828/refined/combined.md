| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco FirePOWER Software for ASA FirePOWER Module Command Injection Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-asasfr-cmd-inject-PE4GfdG  First Published: 2022 June 22 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwb32418](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb32418)     CVE-2022-20828     CWE-236       CVSS Score: [Base 6.5](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2022-20828     CWE-236       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asasfr-cmd-inject-PE4GfdG/csaf/cisco-sa-asasfr-cmd-inject-PE4GfdG.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco FirePOWER Software for Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) FirePOWER module could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected ASA FirePOWER module as the *root* user.  This vulnerability is due to improper handling of undefined command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted command on the CLI or by submitting a crafted HTTPS request to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module.  **Note:** To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative access to the Cisco ASA. A user who has administrative access to a particular Cisco ASA is also expected to have administrative access to the ASA FirePOWER module that is hosted by that Cisco ASA.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asasfr-cmd-inject-PE4GfdG>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ASA FirePOWER modules if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco FirePOWER Software and were configured to block all access to the Linux shell using the **system** **lockdown[-sensor]** CLI command.  **Note:** The attack vector through an HTTPS request is open only if HTTPS management access is enabled on the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the ASA FirePOWER Module Lockdown Configuration To determine if lockdown mode is enabled on the ASA FirePOWER module, log in to the ASA FirePOWER module with administrative privileges and enter **?**. If the **expert** command does not appear in the list of available commands, lockdown mode is enabled. Determine the HTTPS Management Access Configuration To identify the status of HTTPS management access, use the **show running-config http** CLI command. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config http** command on a device that has HTTPS management access enabled on the *inside* interface:  ```   asa# show running-config http          http server enablehttp 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 inside   ```  The HTTPS management access is disabled if one of the following is true:    + The line that starts with **http server enable** is missing.   + The output of the **show running-config http** command does not include an HTTP access control list (ACL) that is associated with an interface. If the output does include an HTTP ACL, the exact value of the HTTP ACL does not affect the vulnerability status of the device. However, for successful exploitation, the attacker must be able to connect to the HTTPS management server of the device from an IP address that is permitted by the HTTP ACL.  If the line that starts with **http server enable** does not include a port, as in the example above, the default port 443 is used. The exact port value does not affect the vulnerability status of the device. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + ASA Software   + Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software   + Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software   + Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

# Rapid7 Discovered Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, ASDM, and FirePOWER Services Software

* Aug 11, 2022
* 21 min read
* [Jake Baines](/blog/author/jake-baines/)

*Last updated at Fri, 19 Aug 2022 15:36:07 GMT*

Rapid7 discovered vulnerabilities and ânon-securityâ issues affecting [Cisco Adaptive Security Software](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/adaptive-security-appliance-asa-software/series.html) (ASA), [Adaptive Security Device Manager](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/adaptive-security-device-manager/index.html) (ASDM), and [FirePOWER Services Software for ASA](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286283326/type/286277393/release/6.2.3.18). Rapid7 initially reported the issues to Cisco in separate disclosures in February and March 2022. Rapid7 and Cisco continued discussing impact and resolution of the issues through August 2022. The following table lists the vulnerabilities and the last current status that we were able to verify ourselves.

For information on vulnerability checks in InsightVM and Nexpose, please see the `Rapid7 customers` section at the end of this blog.

| **Description** | **Identifier** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco ASDM binary packages are not signed. A malicious ASDM package can be installed on a Cisco ASA resulting in arbitrary code execution on any client system that connects to the ASA via ASDM. | [CVE-2022-20829](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-asdm-sig-NPKvwDjm) | Fixed |
| The Cisco ASDM client does not verify the serverâs SSL certificate, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. | None | Not fixed |
| Cisco ASDM client sometimes logs credentials to a local log file. Cisco indicated this was a duplicate issue, although they updated CVE-2022-20651âs affected versions to include the version Rapid7 reported and issued a new release of ASDM (7.17.1.155) in June. | [CVE-2022-20651](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asdm-logging-jnLOY422) | Fixed |
| Cisco ASDM client is affected by an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability. The issue was originally reported by [Malcolm Lashley](https://gist.github.com/mlashley/7d2c16e91fe37c9ab3b2352615540025) and was disclosed without a fix by Cisco in July 2021. Cisco [reported](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw79912) this issue was fixed in ASDM 7.18.1.150, but Rapid7 has informed Cisco that the issue was in fact not fixed. Cisco retracted ASDM 7.18.1.150 and attempted to fix the issue 7.18.1.152. However, the issue remains exploitable as long as the user clicks through a pop up. Cisco is unlikely to further address this issue. | [CVE-2021-1585](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asdm-rce-gqjShXW)   [CSCvw79912](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw79912) | Not fixed |
| Cisco ASDM binary package contains an unsigned Windows installer. The ASDM client will prompt the user to execute the unsigned installer or users are expected to download the installer from the ASA and execute it. This is an interesting code execution mechanism to be used with CVE-2022-20829 or CVE-2021-1585. | [CSCwc21296](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc21296) | Fixed |
| Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Services is vulnerable to an authenticated, remote command injection vulnerability. Using this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain root access to the FirePOWER module. | [CVE-2022-20828](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asasfr-cmd-inject-PE4GfdG) | Fixed in most maintained versions |
| Cisco FirePOWER module before 6.6.0 allowed a privileged Cisco ASA user to reset the FirePOWER module userâs password. A privileged Cisco ASA user could bypass the FirePOWER module login prompt to gain root access on the FirePOWER module. | [CSCvo79327](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvo79327) | Fixed in most maintained versions |
| Cisco FirePOWER module boot images before 7.0.0 allow a privileged Cisco ASA user to obtain a root shell via command injection or hard-coded credentials. | [CSCvu90861](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu90861) | Fixed in boot images >= 7.0. Not fixed on ASA. |
| Cisco ASA with FirePOWER Services loads and executes arbitrary FirePOWER module boot images. The ASA does not restrict the use of old boot images or even the use of boot images that werenât created by Cisco. This could result in code execution from a malicious boot image. | None | Not fixed |
| Some Cisco FirePOWER module boot images support the installation of unsigned FirePOWER installation packages. This could result in code execution from a malicious package. | None | Not fixed |

Rapid7 presented the vulnerabilities, exploits, and tools at [Black Hat USA](https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/briefings/schedule/index.html#do-not-trust-the-asa-trojans-27162) and [DEF CON](https://forum.defcon.org/node/241939) on August 11 and August 13, respectively.

## Product description

Cisco ASA Software is a âcore operating system for the Cisco ASA Family.â Cisco ASA are widely deployed enterprise-class firewalls that also support VPN, IPS, and many other features.

Cisco ASDM is a graphical user interface for remote administration of appliances using Cisco ASA Software.

FirePOWER Services Software is a suite of software that supports the installation of the FirePOWER module on [Cisco ASA 5500-X with FirePOWER Services](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/asa-firepower-services/index.html).

## Credit

This issue was discovered by [Jake Baines](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/author/jake-baines/) of Rapid7, and it is being disclosed in accordance with Rapid7's [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.rapid7.com/security/disclosure/).

## Analysis

Of all the reported issues, Rapid7 believes the following to be the most critical.

### CVE-2022-20829: ASDM binary package is not signed

The [Cisco ASDM binary package](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/279513399/type/280775064/release/7.17.1.155) is installed on the Cisco ASA. Administrators that use ASDM to manage their ASA download and install the Cisco ASDM Launcher on their Windows or macOS system. When the ASDM launcher connects to the ASA, it will download a large number of Java files from the ASA, load them into memory, and then pass execution to the downloaded Java.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/2022/08/image12.png)

The ASDM launcher installer, the Java class files, the ASDM web portal, and other files are all contained within the ASDM binary package distributed by Cisco. Rapid7 analyzed the format of the binary package and determined that it lacked any type of cryptographic signature to verify the packageâs authenticity (see [CWE-347](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html)). We discovered that we could modify the contents of an ASDM package, update a hash in the packageâs header, and successfully install the package on a Cisco ASA.

The result is that an attacker can craft an ASDM package that contains malicious installers, malicious web pages, and/or malicious Java. An example of exploitation using a malicious ASDM package goes like this: An administrator using the ASDM client connects to the ASA and downloads/executes attacker-provided Java. The attacker then has access to the administratorâs system (e.g. the attacker can send themselves a reverse shell). A similar attack was executed by [Slingshot APT](https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/web-sas-2018-apt-announcement-2/14873/) against Mikrotik routers and the administrative tool Winbox.

The value of this vulnerability is high because the ASDM package is a distributable package. A malicious ASDM package might be installed on an ASA in a supply chain attack, installed by an insider, installed by a third-party vendor/administrator, or simply made available âfor freeâ on the internet for administrators to discover themselves (downloading ASDM from Cisco requires a valid contract).

Rapid7 has published a tool, [the way](https://github.com/jbaines-r7/theway), that demonstrates extracting and rebuilding âvalidâ ASDM packages. The way can also generate ASDM packages with an embedded reverse shell. The following video demonstrates an administrative user triggering the reverse shell simply by connecting to the ASA.
