Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-20828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of undefined command parameters within the CLI parser of Cisco FirePOWER Software for Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) FirePOWER modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected ASA FirePOWER module as the *root* user. This is achieved by injecting malicious commands through crafted CLI commands or HTTPS requests.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The core issue stems from the software's failure to properly sanitize or validate command parameters, leading to the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary commands with root privileges on the FirePOWER module's operating system. This can allow the attacker to take full control of the affected device.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands as root could allow an attacker to steal data, modify configurations, cause a denial of service, or install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CLI:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability through a crafted command on the CLI of the ASA FirePOWER module.
*  **HTTPS Requests:** An attacker can also exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS requests to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ASA hosting the ASA FirePOWER module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module. The advisory notes that a user with administrative access to the ASA is expected to have administrative access to the ASA FirePOWER module.
* **Network Access:** For exploitation via HTTPS requests, the attacker needs to be able to connect to the HTTPS management server of the device. This depends on the HTTP access control list (ACL) configured on the ASA.

**Additional Details from the provided content**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA FirePOWER modules that are configured to block all access to the Linux shell using the `system lockdown[-sensor]` CLI command and are running a vulnerable version of Cisco FirePOWER Software.
*   The attack vector through an HTTPS request is only open if HTTPS management access is enabled on the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jake Baines of Rapid7.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, and there are no workarounds.
*   Rapid7 also discovered a series of other related vulnerabilities affecting the ASA, ASDM, and FirePOWER Services software.

**CWE:**
* The advisory lists CWE-236 as a related weakness, which relates to improper input validation, which in turn leads to command injection.
