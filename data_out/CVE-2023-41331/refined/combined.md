# Remote Command Execution(RCE) Vulnerbility

Low

[EvenLjj](/EvenLjj)
published
GHSA-chv2-7hxj-2j86
Sep 12, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 5.11.0

## Patched versions

5.11.0

## Description

### Impact

SOFARPC framework is facing the risk of Remote Command Execution(RCE) Vulnerbility. Through a carefully

craft payload, an attacker can achieve JNDI Injection or System Command Executation attack.

In the default configuration of the SOFARPC framework, a blacklist is used to filter out dangerous classes

encountered during the deserialization process. However, the blacklist is not comprehensive, and we will

demonstrate that we can exploit certain native JDK classes and common third-party packages (e.g., fastjson,

jackson, etc., which are also introduced into the SOFARPC framework) to construct gadget chains capable of

achieving JNDI Injection or System Command Execution attacks.

### Patches

Fixed this issue by adding a blacklist, users can upgrade to sofarpc version 5.11.0 to avoid this issue.

### Workarounds

SOFARPC also provides a way to add additional blacklist. Users can add `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat` to avoid this issue.

### Credits

Bofei Chen, Xinyou Huang, and Lei Zhang@secsys from Fudan.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-41331

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
