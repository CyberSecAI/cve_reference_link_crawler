*   **User Interaction:** The CVSS vector string implies that user interaction is required `UI:R`, implying the attacker needs some form of user interaction to trigger the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target machine.
*   **Non-Admin Account:** The attacker only needs a standard, non-administrative user account on the system.

**Summary of the CVE:**

The vulnerability is in the Dell OS Recovery Tool that allows a local user with standard access to elevate privileges. This can be achieved through improper access controls in the mentioned versions of the software.
