Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24304:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **broken access control** issue in the `ajax.php` file of the Mailjet module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module did not properly restrict access to this file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor:** The core weakness is that the `ajax.php` file, designed to handle AJAX requests, exposed technical and sensitive information without any access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker (guest) can access sensitive technical data, including:
    *   A full list of installed modules with their versions.
    *   The admin panel link of the PrestaShop installation.
    *   A sensitive security token.
*   **Facilitation of Further Attacks:** The information gained can be used to facilitate other attacks such as SQL injection attacks (CWE-89).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** An attacker does not need any user account or special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User interaction:** The attack requires no user interaction.
*   The attacker can be any unauthenticated user (guest).

**Technical Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in versions of the Mailjet module up to and including 3.5.0.
* Version 3.5.1 of the module contains the fix.
* The provided patch adds token validation to the `ajax.php` file to protect it.

```
+$token_ok = Tools::getAdminToken(
+    'AdminModules' . (int) Tab::getIdFromClassName('AdminModules') . (int) Tools::getValue('id_employee')
+);
+
+if (Tools::getValue('token') != $token_ok) {
+    die('hack attempt');
+}
```
*   The patch introduces a token validation check by retrieving an admin token based on the module and employee ID then compares this to the token provided in the request. If tokens do not match, it terminates execution of the script.

**Additional recommendations:**
*   Restrict access to a whitelist of allowed URI patterns, specifically `/modules/mailjet/ajax/` and `/modules/mailjet/ajax.php`.
