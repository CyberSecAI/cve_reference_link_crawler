```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of Buffers in file system APIs within the experimental permission model of Node.js v20.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A path traversal vulnerability that bypasses file permission checks when verifying file permissions using Buffers.
- Impact of exploitation: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the permission model. Specifically, they can traverse the file system and access files they are not supposed to have access to
- Attack vectors: The attacker must specify a path traversal sequence in a Buffer, exploiting the improper handling of Buffers in file system APIs.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to use the experimental permission model in Node.js v20 and have some ability to control or influence the Buffer data used in file system APIs. A low privilege user is enough to trigger the vulnerability according to CVSS score.
