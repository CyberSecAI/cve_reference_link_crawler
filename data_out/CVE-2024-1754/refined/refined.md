- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (like an admin) can inject malicious scripts that execute when other users view a page containing a specific shortcode. This can lead to various malicious activities like stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. The vulnerability can be exploited even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed, which is often a security measure in multisite setups.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an administrator or another user with high privileges to access the plugin's settings page. Then, they can inject the malicious script into the "Title" field within the plugin's settings. A victim needs to view a page where the `[nps-computy]` shortcode has been added, triggering the execution of the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative or equivalent privileges on the WordPress site.
