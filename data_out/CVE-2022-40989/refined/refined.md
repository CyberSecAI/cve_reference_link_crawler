The provided content is related to CVE-2022-40989.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into a stack buffer, but the size of the input parameters is not checked against the buffer size. This leads to a buffer overflow when the input parameters are too large.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to the use of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution. An attacker can potentially gain complete control of the device by overwriting the return address and executing their own code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted network packets containing a specific command to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable device. The attacker needs to know the structure of the `DetranCLI` commands and specific parameters that trigger the overflow.
- The CVSS score indicates a high level of privilege is required, so the attacker likely needs to be authenticated, or already have compromised the device.

**Specifics for CVE-2022-40989:**
The specific command template for this vulnerability is:

```
bandwidth WORD dlrate <1-9999> dlceil <1-9999> ulrate <1-9999> ulceil <1-9999> priority (highest|high|normal|low|lowest)
```

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```
sprintf(buff_0x80,"%s<%s<%s<%s<%s<%d<0<0",*argv,argv[1],argv[2],argv[3],argv[4],based_on_argv[5]);
```

The `sprintf` call uses a stack buffer of size `0x80` bytes (`buff_0x80`). The `argv[1]` to `argv[4]` are not size-checked, thus allowing an attacker to provide long strings and cause a stack buffer overflow.
