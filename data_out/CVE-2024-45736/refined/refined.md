Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
An improperly formatted `INGEST_EVAL` parameter within a field transformation can cause the Splunk daemon (`splunkd`) to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation/handling of the `INGEST_EVAL` parameter in the field transformation process.
- Lack of sufficient safeguards against malformed parameters leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) of the Splunk daemon (`splunkd`), leading to:
  - Disruption of Splunk operations
  - Potential data loss
  - Service downtime

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack can be triggered by crafting a malicious search query containing an improperly formatted `INGEST_EVAL` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-privileged user: An attacker needs only low-privileged access to Splunk; they do not need "admin" or "power" roles.
- Ability to craft a search query with the malicious `INGEST_EVAL` parameter.

- A detection for this vulnerability exists, named "Splunk Improperly Formatted Parameter Crashes splunkd".
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSSv3.1 score of 6.5
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption.
- The exploit involves a specially crafted search query using "makeresults" and "ingestpreview*transforms*".
- The provided Splunk query uses the `Splunk_Audit.Search_Activity` data model to identify malicious searches.
