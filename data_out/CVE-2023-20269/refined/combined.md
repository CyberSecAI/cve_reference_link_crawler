| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software Remote Access VPN Unauthorized Access Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-asaftd-ravpn-auth-8LyfCkeC  First Published: 2023 September 6 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2023 October 11 14:59 GMT  Version 1.4:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwh23100](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh23100)  [CSCwh45108](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh45108)     CVE-2023-20269     CWE-288       CVSS Score: [Base 5.0](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2023-20269     CWE-288       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ravpn-auth-8LyfCkeC/csaf/cisco-sa-asaftd-ravpn-auth-8LyfCkeC.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the remote access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a brute force attack in an attempt to identify valid username and password combinations or an authenticated, remote attacker to establish a clientless SSL VPN session with an unauthorized user.  This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) between the remote access VPN feature and the HTTPS management and site-to-site VPN features. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to achieve one or both of the following:    + Identify valid credentials that could then be used to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN session.   + Establish a clientless SSL VPN session (only when running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier). **Notes:**    + Establishing a client-based remote access VPN tunnel is not possible as these default connection profiles/tunnel groups do not and cannot have an IP address pool configured.   + This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to bypass authentication. To successfully establish a remote access VPN session, valid credentials are required, including a valid second factor if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is configured. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ravpn-auth-8LyfCkeC>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco devices if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA or FTD Software. The exact conditions to determine whether a device is vulnerable depend on the desired outcome, as detailed below.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Brute Force Attack The brute force attack can be executed if both of the following conditions are met:    + At least one user is configured with a password in the LOCAL database *or* HTTPS management authentication points to a valid AAA server.   + SSL VPN is enabled on at least one interface *or* IKEv2 VPN is enabled on at least one interface. A successful brute force attack would allow an attacker to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN session. Unauthorized Clientless SSL VPN Session Establishment To successfully establish a clientless SSL VPN session, all of the following conditions need to be met:    + The attacker has valid credentials for a user present either in the LOCAL database *or* in the AAA server used for HTTPS management authentication. These credentials could be obtained using brute force attack techniques.   + The device is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier.   + SSL VPN is enabled on at least one interface.   + The clientless SSL VPN protocol is allowed in the *DfltGrpPolicy.* **Note:** When running Cisco FTD Software, this attack cannot succeed as Cisco FTD Software does not support the clientless SSL VPN feature. Determine the Device Configuration To determine the configuration settings for the LOCAL database, HTTPS management authentication, IKEv2 VPN, SSL VPN, and clientless SSL VPN protocol on a device, use the following instructions.  **Assess the LOCAL User Database**  Use the **show running-config username | include password** CLI command to determine whether a local user with a password configured is present in the LOCAL database. Non-empty output of this command indicates that at least one user with a password is configured. Empty output of this command indicates that no user with a password set is configured.  The LOCAL user database is empty by default.  **Assess the HTTPS Management Authentication Configuration**  Use the **show running-config aaa authentication | include http** CLI command to determine whether HTTPS management authentication points to a valid AAA server. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config aaa authentication | include http** command on a device that points to AAA server *ISE* for HTTPS management authentication:  ```   asa# show running-config aaa authentication | include httpaaa authentication http console ISE   ```  The following example shows the output of this command on a device that points to the LOCAL database:  ```   asa# show running-config aaa authentication | include httpaaa authentication http console LOCAL    ```  HTTPS management authentication is not configured by default.  **Notes:**    + When running Cisco ASA Software, the **aaa authentication http console** command can also list both a AAA server and LOCAL. In this case, only the LOCAL database is used if the configured AAA server is not reachable.   + When running Cisco FTD Software, the **aaa authentication http console** *aaa\_server* command can be pushed using FlexConfig only, and the LOCAL option is supported only in releases 7.0 and later. **Assess the IKEv2 VPN Configuration**  Use the **show running-config crypto ikev2 | include crypto ikev2 enable** CLI command to determine whether IKEv2 VPN is enabled on any interface. Non-empty output of this command indicates that IKEv2 VPN is enabled on the listed interface(s). Empty output indicates that IKEv2 VPN is not enabled on any interface.  The following example shows the output of the **show running-config crypto ikev2 | include crypto ikev2 enable** command on a device that has IKEv2 VPN enabled on the *outside* interface:  ```   asa# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include crypto ikev2 enablecrypto ikev2 enable outside   ```  IKEv2 VPN is not enabled on any interface by default.  **Note:** The **crypto ikev2 enable** command may specify an additional **client-services** option that may include an optional **port** parameter. These options do not affect the device status in regard to this vulnerability.  **Assess the SSL VPN Configuration**  Use the **show running-config webvpn | include ^ enable** CLI command to determine whether SSL VPN is enabled on any interface. Non-empty output of this command indicates that SSL VPN is enabled on the listed interface(s). Empty output indicates that SSL VPN is not enabled on any interface.  The following example shows the output of the **show running-config webvpn | include ^ enable** command on a device that has SSL VPN enabled on the *outside* interface:  ```   asa# show running-config webvpn | include ^ enable enable outside   ```  SSL VPN is not enabled on any interface by default.  **Assess the Clientless SSL VPN Protocol Configuration**  Use the **show running-config all group-policy DfltGrpPolicy | include vpn-tunnel-protocol** CLI command to determine whether the clientless SSL VPN protocol is allowed in the *DfltGrpPolicy*. If the output of this command includes **ssl-clientless**, as shown in the following example, then the clientless SSL VPN protocol is allowed:  ```   asa# show running-config all group-policy DfltGrpPolicy | include vpn-tunnel-protocol vpn-tunnel-protocol ikev1 ikev2 l2tp-ipsec ssl-clientless   ```  The clientless SSL VPN protocol is allowed in the *DfltGrpPolicy* by default. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software   + FXOS Software   + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR Software   + NX-OS Software  Indicators of Compromise  * Indicators of compromise for this vulnerability are as follows. Brute Force Attack Seeing a high rate of syslog message **%ASA-6-113015**, which reports a failed authentication attempt, can indicate a brute force or password spraying attack. During a brute force attack, a high rate of these messages is typically seen for the same user and from the same IP address. During a password spraying attack, a high rate of these messages is typically seen for a set of users from the same IP address.  The following example shows that user *admin* failed to authenticate successfully, with the authentication request coming from IP address *172.16.17.18*:  ```   %ASA-6-113015: AAA user authentication Rejected : reason = User was not found : local database : user = admin : user IP = 172.16.17.18   ``` Unauthorized Clientless SSL VPN Session Establishment Seeing a session establishment attempt (syslog message **%ASA-7-734003**) or termination event (syslog message **%ASA-4-113019**) that reports one of the following unexpected connection profiles/tunnel groups can indicate successful or attempted establishment of an unauthorized clientless SSL VPN session:    + DefaultADMINGroup   + DefaultL2LGroup The following example shows a session establishment attempt in which user *admin* successfully authenticated using connection profile/tunnel group *DefaultADMINGroup*:  ```   %ASA-7-734003: DAP: User admin, Addr 172.16.17.18: Session Attribute aaa.cisco.tunnelgroup = DefaultADMINGroup   ```  The following example shows that a session created by user *admin* using connection profile/tunnel group *DefaultADMINGroup* has been terminated:  ```   %ASA-4-113019: Group = DefaultADMINGroup, Username = admin, IP = 172.16.17.18, Session disconnected. Session Type: SSL, Duration: 0h:00m:11s, Bytes xmt: 390131, Bytes rcv: 34363, Reason: User Requested   ```  Workarounds  * While there is no method to completely prevent a brute force attack attempt, you can implement the following recommendations to limit the impact of brute force attacks and to protect against unauthorized Clientless SSL VPN session establishment using the *DefaultADMINGroup* or *DefaultL2LGroup* connection profiles/tunnel groups. Brute Force Attacks **Brute Force Attack Against the LOCAL User Database**  To counter brute force attacks against the LOCAL user database, limit the number of consecutive failed login attempts that the ASA allows for a given user in the LOCAL user database using the **aaa local authentication attempts max-fail** *number* command in global configuration mode.  After a user makes the configured number of consecutive login attempts with a wrong password, the user is locked out and cannot log in successfully until the administrator either manually unlocks the user using the **clear aaa local user lockout username** *username* command or (when running Cisco ASA Software releases 9.17 and later) until 10 minutes pass. Locking or unlocking a username results in a syslog message as shown in the following example:  ```   %ASA-6-113006: User 'test' locked out on exceeding '5' successive failed authentication attempts%ASA-6-113007: User 'test' unlocked by 'enable_15'   ```  **Note:** In Cisco ASA Software releases 9.16 and earlier, this feature does not apply to users with privilege level 15.  For further information on this feature, refer to the [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Series Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa-cli-reference/A-H/asa-command-ref-A-H/aa-ac-commands.html#wp1817806139).  **Brute Force Attacks Against an External User Database**  To counter brute force attacks against an external user database, limit the number of consecutive failed login attempts per user in the external user database.  If the external user database is Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), this can be configured under **Administration > Identity Management > Settings > User Authentication Settings > Lock/Suspend Account with Incorrect Login Attempts**.  **Note:** Brute force attacks against an external user database are possible only if either HTTPS management authentication or at least one connection profile/tunnel group points to an external user database. Unauthorized Clientless SSL VPN Session Establishment **Dynamic Access Policies**  Administrators can configure a dynamic access policy (DAP) to terminate VPN tunnel establishment when the *DefaultADMINGroup* or *DefaultL2LGroup* connection profile/tunnel group is used. For more information on how to configure DAP, see the [Configure Dynamic Access Policies](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa916/asdm716/vpn/asdm-716-vpn-config/vpn-asdm-dap.html#ID-2184-000000b8) section of the Cisco ASA Series VPN ASDM Configuration Guide.  **Deny Remote Access VPN Using the Default Group Policy (*DfltGrpPolicy*)**  When the *DfltGrpPolicy* is not expected to be used for remote access VPN policy assignment, administrators can prevent remote access VPN session establishment using the *DefaultADMINGroup* or *DefaultL2LGroup* connection profiles/tunnel groups by setting the **vpn-simultaneous-logins** option for the *DfltGrpPolicy* to zero, as shown in the following example:  ```   group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes vpn-simultaneous-logins 0   ```  **Notes:**    + Connection profiles/tunnel groups point to the *DfltGrpPolicy* by default. Before applying this workaround, administrators must confirm that all connection profiles/tunnel groups that are expected to be used for remote access VPN session establishment in their environment point to a custom group policy by using the **default-group-policy** option in **tunnel-group** *name* **general-attributes** configuration mode. If the **default-group-policy** option is not visible in the running configuration for a given connection profile/tunnel group, that connection profile/tunnel group uses the *DfltGrpPolicy*.   + By default, custom group policies inherit the **vpn-simultaneous-logins** setting from the *DfltGrpPolicy*. Before applying this workaround, administrators must ensure that all group policies that are expected to be used with remote access VPN sessions explicitly configure the **vpn-simultaneous-logins** option to a value larger than zero. **Restrict Users in the LOCAL User Database**  The following two workarounds apply to clientless SSL VPN session establishment that is using the *DefaultADMINGroup* only when HTTPS management authentication points to the LOCAL user database. They always apply to clientless SSL VPN session establishment that is using the *DefaultL2LGroup*.  **Lock Users to a Specific Connection Profile/Tunnel Group Only**  When users in the LOCAL user database are expected to be able to establish remote access VPN tunnels, administrators can use the **group-lock** option in username attributes configuration mode to configure a lock so that users can only connect to a specific connection profile/tunnel group. The following example shows how to lock user *lockeduser* to connection profile/tunnel group *MyCorporateProfile*:  ```   username lockeduser attributes group-lock value MyCorporateProfile   ```  **Prevent Users from Establishing Remote Access VPN Sessions**  When users in the LOCAL user database are not expected to be able to establish remote access VPN tunnels at all, administrators can prevent these users from successfully establishing a remote access VPN tunnel by setting the **vpn-simultaneous-logins** option in username attributes configuration mode to zero, as shown in the following example:  ```   username novpn attributes vpn-simultaneous-logins 0    ```  While these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

Additional Resources For help determining the best Cisco ASA, FMC, or FTD Software release, see the following Recommended Releases documents. If a security advisory recommends a later release, Cisco recommends following the advisory guidance.  [Cisco ASA Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html)[Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Upgrade Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/upgrade/asa-upgrade/planning.html)[Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Compatibility Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/compatibility/threat-defense-compatibility.html)  Recommendations  * Cisco makes the following recommendations in regard to this vulnerability: Secure Default Remote Access VPN Profiles When the default remote access VPN connection profiles/tunnel groups *DefaultRAGroup* and *DefaultWEBVPNGroup* are not used, Cisco recommends preventing authentication attempts and remote access VPN session establishment using these default connection profiles/tunnel groups by pointing them to a sinkhole AAA server. To do this, use the following steps:    1. Configure a dummy Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server, as shown in the following example: ```      aaa-server AAA_Sinkhole protocol ldap      ``` Do not add any additional configuration for this AAA server.   2. Point *DefaultRAGroup*, *DefaultWEBVPNGroup*, or both to this dummy LDAP server, as shown for the *DefaultWEBVPNGroup* in the following example: ```      tunnel-group DefaultWEBVPNGroup general-attributes authentication-server-group AAA_Sinkhole      ```Enable Logging Logging is a crucial part of cybersecurity that involves recording events happening within a system. The absence of detailed logs leaves gaps in understanding, hindering a clear analysis of the attack method. Cisco recommends enabling logging to a remote syslog server for improved correlation and auditing of network and security incidents across various network devices.  For information on how to configure logging, see the following platform-specific guides.  **Cisco ASA Software**    + [Use Guide to Secure ASA Firewall](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/200150-Cisco-Guide-to-Harden-Cisco-ASA-Firewall.html)   + [Logging](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa919/configuration/general/asa-919-general-config/monitor-syslog.html) chapter of the Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Series General Operations CLI Configuration Guide **Cisco FTD Software**    + [Configure Logging on FTD via FMC](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/firepower-ngfw/200479-Configure-Logging-on-FTD-via-FMC.html)   + [Configure Syslog](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/management-center/device-config/720/management-center-device-config-72/interfaces-settings-platform.html#concept_8637BBD154854CA498A2DA66D55A115E) section in the Platform Settings chapter of the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Device Configuration Guide   + [Configure and Verify Syslog in Firepower Device Manager](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/firepower-2130-security-appliance/220231-configure-and-verify-syslog-in-firepower.html)   + [Configuring System Logging Settings](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/710/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-710/fptd-fdm-system.html#id_88125) section in the System Settings chapter of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * In August 2023, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) became aware of attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability once available and apply one of the suggested workarounds in the meantime.  For information on observed attempted exploitation of this vulnerability, see the Cisco blog post on [Akira Ransomware Targeting VPNs without Multi-Factor Authentication](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/akira-ransomware-targeting-vpns-without-multi-factor-authentication).
