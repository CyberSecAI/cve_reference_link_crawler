- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper separation of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) between the remote access VPN feature and the HTTPS management and site-to-site VPN features. This allows attackers to exploit default connection profiles/tunnel groups.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Brute-force vulnerability**:  An unauthenticated, remote attacker can attempt to identify valid username and password combinations. This is possible if either a local user with a password or HTTPS management authentication pointing to a AAA server exists, and SSL VPN or IKEv2 VPN is enabled on at least one interface.
    - **Unauthorized Clientless SSL VPN Session Establishment:** An authenticated, remote attacker can establish a clientless SSL VPN session using a default connection profile/tunnel group with unauthorized users (only if running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier).

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Brute Force:** Successful exploitation can lead to the identification of valid credentials, which can then be used to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN session.
    - **Unauthorized Clientless SSL VPN Session:** Successful exploitation can lead to the establishment of an unauthorized clientless SSL VPN session.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Brute Force:** The attacker sends repeated authentication requests with different credentials to a vulnerable VPN interface.
    - **Unauthorized Clientless SSL VPN Session:** The attacker leverages valid credentials, obtained through methods like brute force, and exploits a misconfiguration related to the default connection profiles/tunnel groups to gain unauthorized VPN access.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Brute Force:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device and have knowledge or the ability to try a range of potential usernames and passwords.
    - **Unauthorized Clientless SSL VPN Session:** The attacker needs valid credentials, which can be obtained through brute-force methods, and they must be able to connect to the vulnerable SSL VPN interface.
