9.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H - chain: TALOS-2023-1702

##### CWE

CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (‘Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The MilesightVPN is a software that make easier the setup of VPN tunnel for the Milesight products and allow to monitor the connection status with a web server interface.

The MilesightVPN exposes the `/Device_Auth` API for the various Milesight devices for them to authenticate to the server and to get an OpenVPN configuration. The API is managed by the `Device_Auth` function:

```
function Device_Auth(res,postdata,connection){
    var authcode=postdata['authcode'],subnet=postdata['subnet'],\
                devicename=postdata['device_name'],sn=postdata['sn'];
    var newdt=dll_fun('get_openvpn_params',{});
    [...]
    if(newdt['result']['auth_code']!=authcode)
    {
        [...]
    }
    else
    {
        var $sql='select * from device where sn="'+sn+'"';
        connection.query($sql).then(function(data){
            if(data['error'])
            {
                [... error branch ...]
            }
            else
            {
                if(data['result'].length>0)
                {
                    [...]
                }
                else
                {
                    [...]
                    $sql1='insert into device(name,sn,remote_subnet,status) \
                    value("'+devicename+'","'+sn+'","'+subnet+'",0)';
                    connection.query($sql1).then(function(data1){
                        if(data1['error'])
                        {
                            [...]
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            var newdt3=dll_fun('register_client',{'cn':sn,'subnet':subnet});            [1]
                            [...]
                        }
                    })
                }
            }
        })
    }
}

```

This API expects four entries in the POST payload:
- authcode: is a secret generated by the MilesightVPN
- subnet: the subnet mask of the main network used by the device
- device\_name: the identifier of the device that is connecting to the MilesightVPN server
- sn: is the serial number of the device that is connecting to the MilesightVPN server

Eventually the function will reach the code at `[1]` that will call a function of the `liburvpn.so` library. In this case the function called is `liburvpn.so`’s `register_a_client` that takes one JSON object as argument, the object has the `sn` and the `subnet` as entry values.

Following the `liburvpn.so`’s `register_a_client` function:

```
cJSON * register_a_client(cJSON *params)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  [... variable initialization ...]
  for (obj = params->child; obj != (cJSON *)0x0; obj = obj->next) {
    iVar1 = strcmp(obj->string,"cn");
    if (iVar1 == 0) {
      common_name = obj->valuestring;
    }
    else {
      iVar1 = strcmp(obj->string,"subnet");
      if (iVar1 == 0) {
        subnet = obj->valuestring;
      }
    }
  }
  if ((common_name == (char *)0x0) || (subnet == (char *)0x0)) {
   [...]
  }
  else {
    [...]
    type = check_common_name(common_name);
    if (type == 0) {
      device_max = get_clients_limit();
      snprintf(cmd,0x80,"echo \"device max:%d\" >> /var/urvpn.log",(ulong)(uint)device_max);
      system(cmd);
      print_timestamp();
      printf("Register a router(%s)\n",common_name);
      [...]
      update_subnet(common_name,subnet);
      ret = register_a_router(common_name,ip,mask);                                                     [2]
    }
    [...]
  }
  [...]
}

```

The function will perform various checks and eventually, if no error is encountered and the device is recognized as router, the function `register_a_router`, at `[2]`, will be called. The `register_a_router` function will generate the cryptographic keys used for the VPN connection.

```
int register_a_router(char *cn,char *ip,char *mask)

{
  [...]
  iVar1 = general_keys("./urvpn/routers_ca",cn);
  return iVar1;
}

```

The `register_a_router` function will call the `general_keys` function, that is the one that is effectively going to generate the cryptographic keys:

```
int general_keys(char *path,char *name)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  is_name_0_string = strcmp(name,"000000000000");
  if (is_name_0_string == 0) {
    [...]
  }
  else {
    snprintf(public_name,0x200,"%s/%s.csr",path,name);
    snprintf(private_name,0x200,"%s/%s.key",path,name);
    snprintf(certificate_name,0x200,"%s/%s.crt",path,name);
  }
  private_name_path_exists = check_file_exist(private_name);                                            [3]
  if (private_name_path_exists == 0) {
    print_timestamp();
    printf("create file private %s\n",private_name);
    create_private_key(private_name);                                                                   [4]
  }
  [...]
}

```

This function will have as the `name` parameter the original `sn`, the serial number of the device. If this is not `000000000000`, then various path-names are composed. We are going to focus on the `private_name` variable that is going to have the following form `./urvpn/routers_ca/<serial number>`, at `[3]` it is checked if this pathname corresponds to an existing file, if this file does not exists the `create_private_key` function will be called at `[4]`:

```
void create_private_key(char *private_name)

{
 [...]
  snprintf(cmd,0x200,"openssl genrsa -out %s 1024",private_name);                                       [5]
  print_timestamp();
  printf("create private key:%s\n",cmd);
  system(cmd);
  [...]
}

```

This function, for the code path considered, will execute `system("openssl genrsa -out ./urvpn/routers_ca/<serial number> 1024");`. Because the serial number variable, originally `sn` and then called `cn` in the `liburvpn.so` library, is never checked until `[5]`, the `/Device_Auth` API can lead to an OS command injection in `liburvpn.so` at `[5]`.
An attacker would need to know the Authorization Code of the server to actually use the `/Device_Auth` API. But because TALOS-2023-1702 this information can be easily retrieved by an attacker.
