Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35983:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-35983. It describes a fix for an issue in the Linux kernel's `bounds.c` file related to calculating the number of bits required for the number of CPUs (`CONFIG_NR_CPUS`). The vulnerability stems from the `bits_per()` function incorrectly rounding up to the next power of two, leading to potential crashes.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the incorrect usage of the `bits_per()` function in `kernel/bounds.c`. When `bits_per()` is provided with a power-of-two value, it rounds up to the next power of two. This results in an incorrect calculation for the number of bits needed for `CONFIG_NR_CPUS`, causing crashes on some systems.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect Bit Calculation:** The core issue is the miscalculation of the required bits for `CONFIG_NR_CPUS` when it is a power of two.
- **Potential for Crashes:**  This incorrect bit calculation can lead to crashes, making the system unstable.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is the potential for system crashes, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).
- **System Instability**:  Incorrect calculations can cause unpredictable behavior and instability.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- **Configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific system configurations where `CONFIG_NR_CPUS` is a power of two. The issue is exposed through a miscalculation in the kernel.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **No direct attack vector**: This is not an exploit that can be directly targeted, but rather an issue that is exposed given specific kernel configurations.
- **System Configuration**: An attacker would need some control over system configurations, for example by deploying a container with particular configuration options or setting the config of an embedded device.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix replaces `bits_per()` with `order_base_2()`, which correctly calculates the number of bits required without rounding up.
- The vulnerability was reported by Михаил Новоселов and tested by Ильфат Гаптрахманов of Rosalinux.
- The issue is also related to a previous fix for non-power-of-two `CONFIG_NR_CPUS` support (f2d5dcb48f7b).

**In summary, CVE-2024-35983 is a vulnerability caused by an incorrect bit calculation in the Linux kernel when CONFIG_NR_CPUS is a power of two, potentially leading to system crashes. The fix involves replacing the bits_per() function with order_base_2() to ensure proper bit calculation.**
