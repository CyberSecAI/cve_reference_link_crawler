SUMMARY

Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation contains multiple vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the
application reads PAR, SPP, STP and PRT ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle using the
affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution on the
target host system.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation allows you to model, simulate, explore and optimize logistics systems and
their processes. These models enable analysis of material ﬂow, resource utilization and logistics for all
levels of manufacturing planning from global production facilities to local plants and speciﬁc lines, well in
advance of production execution.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
