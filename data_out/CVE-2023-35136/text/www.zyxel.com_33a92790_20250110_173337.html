###### Summary

Zyxel has released patches addressing multiple vulnerabilities in some firewall and access point (AP) versions. Users are advised to install the patches for optimal protection.

###### What are the vulnerabilities?

CVE-2023-35136

An improper input validation vulnerability in the “Quagga” package of some firewall versions could allow an authenticated local attacker to access configuration files on an affected device.

CVE-2023-35139

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CGI program of some firewall versions could allow an unauthenticated LAN-based attacker to store malicious scripts in a vulnerable device. A successful XSS attack could then result in the stored malicious scripts being executed to steal cookies when the user visits the specific CGI used for dumping ZTP logs.

CVE-2023-37925

An improper privilege management vulnerability in the debug CLI command of some firewall and AP versions could allow an authenticated local attacker to access system files on an affected device.

CVE-2023-37926

A buffer overflow vulnerability in some firewall versions could allow an authenticated local attacker to cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions by executing the CLI command to dump system logs on an affected device.

CVE-2023-4397

A buffer overflow vulnerability in some firewall versions could allow an authenticated local attacker with administrator privileges to cause DoS conditions by executing the CLI command with crafted strings on an affected device.

CVE-2023-4398

An integer overflow vulnerability in the source code of the QuickSec IPSec toolkit used in the VPN feature of some firewall versions could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause DoS conditions on an affected device by sending a crafted IKE packet.

CVE-2023-5650

An improper privilege management vulnerability in the ZySH of some firewall versions could allow an authenticated local attacker to modify the URL of the registration page in the web GUI of an affected device.

CVE-2023-5797

An improper privilege management vulnerability in the debug CLI command of some firewall and AP versions could allow an authenticated local attacker to access the administrator’s logs on an affected device.

CVE-2023-5960

An improper privilege management vulnerability in the hotspot feature of some firewall versions could allow an authenticated local attacker to access the system files on an affected device.
