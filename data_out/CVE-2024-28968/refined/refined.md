The provided content is related to CVE-2024-28968.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Access Control: Internal email and collection settings REST APIs are exposed without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A low-privileged attacker can execute APIs intended for admin users, potentially leading to:
  - Unauthorized access to restricted resources.
  - Change of state on the application's backend database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network access.
- Exploitation of the exposed internal REST APIs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileged access to the network where SCG is accessible.
- Knowledge of the exposed internal email and collection settings REST APIs (if enabled by an Admin user from UI).
