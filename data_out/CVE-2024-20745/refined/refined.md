- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) vulnerability exists in Adobe Premiere Pro.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attack complexity is low (AC:L). User interaction is required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have local access, and the user needs to be tricked into interacting with a malicious file. No privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N).
