### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `github.com/greenpau/caddy-security`.

## Overview

[github.com/greenpau/caddy-security](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/greenpau/caddy-security) is a Security App and Plugin for Caddy v2.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation of Array Index when parsing a `Caddyfile`. Multiple parsing functions in the affected library do not validate whether their input values are nil before attempting to access elements, which can lead to a panic (index out of range). Panics during the parsing of a configuration file may introduce ambiguity and vulnerabilities, hindering the correct interpretation and configuration of the web server.

## PoC

```
func TestCrashCredentialsUsername(t *testing.T) {
    file := caddyfile.NewTestDispenser(string("0 { credentials 0 { username"))
    parseCaddyfile(file, nil)
}

func TestCrashCredentialsDomain(t *testing.T) {
    file := caddyfile.NewTestDispenser(string("0 { credentials 0 { domain"))
    parseCaddyfile(file, nil)
}

func TestCrashSSOProvider(t *testing.T) {
    file := caddyfile.NewTestDispenser(string("00 {  sso provider 0 {  entity_id"))
    parseCaddyfile(file, nil)
}

func TestCrashParseCaddyfileMessaging(t *testing.T) {
    file := caddyfile.NewTestDispenser(string("0 { messaging email provider 0 { address"))
    parseCaddyfile(file, nil)
}

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
