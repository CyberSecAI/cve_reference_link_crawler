| *Severity: Low*  Multiple parsing functions do not validate whether their input values are nil before attempting to access elements, which can lead to a panic (index out of range). Panics during the parsing of a Caddyfile may introduce ambiguity and vulnerabilities, hindering the correct interpretation and configuration of the web server.  Integrate nil checks for input values before element access across all relevant functions to address these issues.  To prevent similar issues of this type, add Golang’s native fuzz tests for Caddyfile parsing functions.  Example crashes:  ``` func TestCrashCredentialsUsername(t *testing.T) { 	file := caddyfile.NewTestDispenser(string("0 { credentials 0 { username")) 	parseCaddyfile(file, nil) }  func TestCrashCredentialsDomain(t *testing.T) { 	file := caddyfile.NewTestDispenser(string("0 { credentials 0 { domain")) 	parseCaddyfile(file, nil) }  func TestCrashSSOProvider(t *testing.T) { 	file := caddyfile.NewTestDispenser(string("00 {  sso provider 0 {  entity_id")) 	parseCaddyfile(file, nil) }  func TestCrashParseCaddyfileMessaging(t *testing.T) { 	file := caddyfile.NewTestDispenser(string("0 { messaging email provider 0 { address")) 	parseCaddyfile(file, nil) } ```  Example crash log:  ``` === RUN   TestCrashCredentials --- FAIL: TestCrashCredentials (0.00s) panic: runtime error: index out of range [0] with length 0 [recovered] 	panic: runtime error: index out of range [0] with length 0  goroutine 40 [running]: testing.tRunner.func1.2({0x2421580, 0xc000154b28}) 	/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/src/testing/testing.go:1526 +0x24e testing.tRunner.func1() 	/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/src/testing/testing.go:1529 +0x39f panic({0x2421580, 0xc000154b28}) 	/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/src/runtime/panic.go:884 +0x213 github.com/greenpau/caddy-security.parseCaddyfileCredentials(0xc000c50ae0, 0x19462d1?, 0xc00081b760) 	audit-caddy/audit-caddy-security/caddyfile_credentials.go:53 +0x534 github.com/greenpau/caddy-security.parseCaddyfile(0xc000c50ae0, {0xc000161760?, 0x1092fb7?}) 	audit-caddy/audit-caddy-security/caddyfile.go:60 +0x392 github.com/greenpau/caddy-security.TestCrashCredentials(0x0?) 	audit-caddy/audit-caddy-security/caddyfile_authn_test.go:986 +0x2e testing.tRunner(0xc000502340, 0x2ddadc0) 	/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/src/testing/testing.go:1576 +0x10b created by testing.(*T).Run 	/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/src/testing/testing.go:1629 +0x3ea ```  More information about our public disclosure:   * <https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy/> |
