  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an excessive memory allocation within the `_bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line_with_alt` function in dwarf2.c when processing a crafted ELF file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Excessive memory consumption",
      "Lack of proper bounds checking on section sizes"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit leads to denial of service (DoS) due to out-of-memory conditions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted ELF file",
      "Processing of a malicious ELF file via the nm tool"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted ELF file to the `nm` tool for processing. This can be a local file."
