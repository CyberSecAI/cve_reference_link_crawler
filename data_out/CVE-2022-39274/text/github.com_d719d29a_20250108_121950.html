[v4.7.0](/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node/tree/v4.7.0)

[`672b37d`](/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node/commit/672b37deec7589b2e7346d3acb6a0e8ba79fa9fe)

### General

* Release based on "LoRaWAN specification 1.0.4" and "LoRaWAN specification 1.1.0 + FCntDwn ERRATA" with "LoRaWAN Regional Parameters 2-1.0.3"
* GitHub reported issues corrections.

### Known limitations

* SAMR34 platform does not implement NVM storage functionality. This is a requirement for LoRaWAN versions greater or equal to 1.0.4.

  No work on this subject is forseen by the maintainers. Implementation proposals are welcome.

### Added

* Trigger NVM update on `MacGroup2.DutyCycleOn` change
* Configure radio sync word upon state restoration from NVM
* Added missing return status initialization for Class A
* Added a check for `GroupId` in order to avoid out of bounds access
* Make LBT RSSI free channel threshold and carrier sense time (CST) parameters configurable
* Signal NVM data change in `LoRaMacMc*` functions
* Teach `LoRaMacIsBusy` return false if the MAC is stopped
* Added support for new release of ARIB STD-T108 Ver1.4 under AS923 region
* Support LoRaWAN 1.1 with ATECC608A/B secure element
* Added a function to reset the stack internal state machine
* Added an option for MAC commands to verify against an explicit confirmation
* Added a check to verify that `SystemMaxRxError` provided value is in the range 0..500 ms

### Changed

* Updated regions implementation to regional parameters RP2-1.0.3
* Move AdrAckLimit and AdrAckDelay to NVM `MacGroup2`
* Refactored and improved the way the duty-cycle is managed

### Fixed

* Fixed class B multicast handling in `LoRaMacClassBProcessMulticastSlot()`
* Restore `RegionGroup2` in `RestoreNvmData`
* Fix a duty cycle related deadlock in `ScheduleTx`
* Fixed where `LastDownFCnt` update takes place for LoRaWAN 1.1.x
* Fixes for class C activation and deactivation
* Don't `memset` the TX/RX buffer when radio is set to receive mode
* Fixed usage of wrong API for general purpose keys
* Fixed and refactored JoinReq, `ReJoinType0Req`, `ReJoinType1Req`, `ReJoinType2Req` handling
* Fixed Rx windows timer handling
* Fixed FUOTA fragmentation implementation
* Fixed time credits check as proposed
* Fixed potential buffer overflow in `ProcessRadioRxDone` - [Security](###security)
* Applied the proposed fix for the CRC check of empty `struct`
* Fixed inconsistent handling of undefined callbacks
* Fixed `HardFault_Handler` for Cortex-M0 targets
* Fixed ABP join handling to be similar to OTAA join handling
* Fixed issue with RX2 data rate in case of 0x0F for `RxParamSetupReq` and `JoinAccept`

### Removed

* Removed useless `FOptsLen` filed check
* Removed unused `ACTIVE_REGION` pre-processing check

### Security

* Security breach found by Simon W√∂rner([@SWW13](https://github.com/SWW13)) please refer to security advisory - [security advisory - CVE-2022-39274](https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node/security/advisories/GHSA-7vv8-73pc-63c2)
