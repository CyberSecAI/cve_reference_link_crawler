### Description

The Export and Import Users and Customers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'hf\_update\_customer' function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 2.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level permissions to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.
