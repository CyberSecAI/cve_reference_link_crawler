| There is a segment fault in jfif\_decode (ctxt=0x60a010, pb=0x7fffffffe3c0) at jfif.c:545.  My system is ubuntu 16.04.6 amd64. I compiled the lastest version of ffjpeg and use my fuzzer to fuzz it by using the command ling: ffjpeg -d [file\_name]  I got a crash sample that could cause a segment fault.  The sample is attached below.
