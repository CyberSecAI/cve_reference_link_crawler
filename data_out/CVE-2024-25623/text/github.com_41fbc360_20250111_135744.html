# Lack of media type verification of Activity Streams objects allows impersonation of remote accounts

High

[renchap](/renchap)
published
GHSA-jhrq-qvrm-qr36
Feb 17, 2024

## Package

Mastodon

## Affected versions

<= v4.2.6

## Patched versions

4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, 3.5.19

## Description

### Summary

When fetching remote statuses, Mastodon doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Mastodon server fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads.

### Details

Some federated server implementations allow their users to upload arbitrary documents, including JSON documents, as attachments to posts.

On the other hand, Mastodon's `FetchRemoteStatusService` did not check that the response from the remote server had a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type (i.e. `application/ld+json` with a profile value of `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams`, or `application/activity+json`). This implies that a Mastodon server can fetch a user-uploaded document on a remote server and accept it as an Activity Streams object unless it's otherwise malformed.

`FetchRemoteStatusService#trustworthy_attribution?` trusts the `attributedTo` property of a fetched object as long as the domain of the attributed actor is the same as the original request URI. Consequently, a threat actor with a low-privileged account on a remote server can upload an Activity Streams document with a crafted `attributedTo` property to the remote server and make a Mastodon server fetch it in order to impersonate another account on the same remote server.

`FetchRemoteActorService` doesn't check the `Content-Type` either. But it requires that the remote account is resolvable from a canonical `acct:` URI via WebFinger, so the service would reject a user-uploaded actor objects (unless the threat actor somehow manages to trick the remote server's well-known endpoint into resolving to the fake actor document).

`JsonLdHelper#fetch_resource` rejects the fetched resource if the `id` of the top-level node of the JSON-LD document doesn't match the original request URL, which increases complexity of the exploit as the threat actor needs an ability to predict the URI of the uploaded documents before uploading them or to edit the uploaded documents without changing the URI. For example, Misskey uses UUIDs in the URIs of uploaded documents so it's hard to impersonate accounts on a Misskey instance against Mastodon.

### Impact

The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties:

1. Allows the attacker to register an account
2. Accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as the ActivityPub actors
3. Serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type

The vulnerability may also affect accounts on server implementations that don't normally serve arbitrary user-uploaded documents, in combination with a vulnerability of the other implementation like [GHSA-9928-3cp5-93fm](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-9928-3cp5-93fm "GHSA-9928-3cp5-93fm") which can make the server serve arbitrary document,

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
