Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue found within the View setting page of the VI Web Client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Stored Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79):** The application improperly handles user-supplied input when configuring the View settings. Malicious script can be injected, and it's stored in the system. When other users access the view settings page, this malicious script executes in their browser context.

- This can lead to a range of malicious actions, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting a malicious script into the View settings page.
- **Authentication required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the VI Web Client to add the malicious script

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account with the VI Web Client.
- **Ability to Modify View Settings:** The attacker requires the permission to modify view settings, allowing the attacker to inject malicious code into the settings.
