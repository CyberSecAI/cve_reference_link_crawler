# GHSA for sagemaker.base\_deserializers.NumpyDeserializer

High

[akrishna1995](/akrishna1995)
published
GHSA-wjvx-jhpj-r54r
May 2, 2024

## Package

sagemaker-python-sdk
(Sagemaker)

## Affected versions

<2.218.0

## Patched versions

2.218.0

## Description

### Impact

sagemaker.base\_deserializers.NumpyDeserializer module before v2.218.0 allows potentially unsafe deserialization when untrusted data is passed as pickled object arrays. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity.

Impacted versions: <2.218.0.

### Credit

We would like to thank HiddenLayer for collaborating on this issue through the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.

### Workarounds

Do not pass pickled numpy object arrays which originated from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with. Only pass pickled numpy object arrays from sources you trust.

### References

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that you contact AWS/Amazon Security via our vulnerability reporting page [1] or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.

[1] Vulnerability reporting page: <https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting>

Fixed by: [#4557](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/4557)

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-34072

*Issue #, if available:*

*Description of changes:*

Setting the NumpyDeserializer allow\_pickle default value to False.

All Base predictor class will now require an instantiation of the NumpyDeserializer with the allow\_pickle=True explicitly

if not error message "Please set the param allow\_pickle=True to deserialize pickle objects" will be thrown.

*Testing done:*

Local testing with UTs
