{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `sagemaker.base_deserializers.NumpyDeserializer` module allowed unsafe deserialization of pickled object arrays from untrusted sources.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsafe deserialization of pickled data, specifically numpy object arrays, allowing for remote code execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution and denial of service, affecting confidentiality and integrity. An unprivileged third party could cause remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Passing untrusted pickled numpy object arrays to the `NumpyDeserializer` module.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the untrusted pickled numpy object array. User interaction is required as the user needs to deserialize the data using the vulnerable deserializer."
