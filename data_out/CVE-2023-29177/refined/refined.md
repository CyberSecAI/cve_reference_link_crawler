**Impact of exploitation:**
- A privileged attacker can execute arbitrary code or commands on the vulnerable device.
- The attacker can gain full control of the affected system due to the ability to run arbitrary commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted CLI requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
