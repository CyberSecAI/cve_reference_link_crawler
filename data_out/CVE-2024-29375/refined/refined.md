The provided content relates to CVE-2024-29375.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a CSV injection flaw. The application allows users to input data into fields such as "Project Description", "Identifiers", "Custom Triangle Name" and "Yield Curve Name" without proper sanitization. When this data is exported to a CSV file and opened in a spreadsheet program (like Excel), injected formulas are executed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input sanitization of user-supplied data in fields that are later exported to CSV format.
- Unsafe handling of CSV files by spreadsheet software, which executes formulas contained in the exported CSV data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine when the exported CSV file is opened. This is demonstrated by the opening of `notepad.exe`.
- Potential for malware installation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities by exploiting the execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting malicious formulas into vulnerable input fields of the Addactis IBNRS application.
- Exporting the application data to a CSV file.
- Opening the exported CSV file using a spreadsheet program that executes the injected formulas.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileged user with access to the Addactis IBNRS application to input data into affected fields.
- Ability to export data in CSV format and convince a user to open the file with a spreadsheet program.
