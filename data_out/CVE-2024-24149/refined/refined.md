- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `parseSWF_GLYPHENTRY` function in `parser.c` allocates memory for `gerec->GlyphIndex` and `gerec->GlyphAdvance`, but this memory is never freed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak in the `parseSWF_GLYPHENTRY` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A crafted SWF file can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by continuously leaking memory.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs by processing a malicious SWF file using `swftophp`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a crafted SWF file to a user that is using a vulnerable version of `libming` or tools utilizing this library.
