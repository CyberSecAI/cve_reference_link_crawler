# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1955

## NVIDIA D3D10 Driver Shader Functionality SAMPLE out-of-bounds read vulnerability

##### October 23, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-0121

##### SUMMARY

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the Shader Functionality SAMPLE instruction of NVIDIA D3D10 Driver NVIDIA D3D10 Driver, Version 551.61, 31.0.15.5161. A specially crafted executable / shader file can lead to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker can provide a specially crafted shader file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

NVIDIA D3D10 Driver NVIDIA D3D10 Driver, Version 551.61, 31.0.15.5161

##### PRODUCT URLS

D3D10 Driver - <https://nvidia.com>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-125 - Out-of-bounds Read

##### DETAILS

NVIDIA Graphics drivers are software for NVIDIA Graphics GPU installed on the PC, used to communicate between the operating system and the GPU device. This software is required in most cases for the hardware device to function properly.

This vulnerability potentially could be triggered from guest machines running virtualization environments (ie. VMware, qemu, VirtualBox etc.) in order to perform guest-to-host escape - as it was demonstrated before (TALOS-2018-0533, TALOS-2018-0568, etc.). Theoretically this vulnerability could be also triggered from web browser
(using webGL and webassembly). We were able to trigger this vulnerability from HYPER-V guest using RemoteFX feature leading to executing the vulnerable code on the HYPER-V host (inside of the rdvgm.exe process). While the RemoteFX was recently depracated by Microsoft some older machines may still use this software.

This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a malformed shader. This leads to out-of-bounds memory read problem in NVIDIA driver.

To trigger the bug we have modified and corrupted the shaderbyte code coresponding to the “SAMPLE” instruction (SAMPLE instruction samples data from the specified Element/texture using the specified address and the filtering mode identified by the given sampler).

This leads to out-of-bounds memory read situation:
