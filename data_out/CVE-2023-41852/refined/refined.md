- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MailMunch â€“ Grow your Email List WordPress plugin versions 3.1.2 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted malicious link or HTML page. An attacker tricks a logged-in user into submitting a request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or clicking on a malicious link that executes a crafted request. No specific privilege is required by the attacker on the target WordPress site.
