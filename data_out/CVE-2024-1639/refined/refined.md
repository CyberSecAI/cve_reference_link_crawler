{
  "vulnerability_details": {

    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authorization",
       "Missing Capability Check"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers with contributor or higher access can view arbitrary decrypted license keys.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the `wp_ajax_lmfwc_show_license_key` and `wp_ajax_lmfwc_show_all_license_keys` AJAX actions.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor role access to the WordPress admin dashboard. Additionally, they need to be able to obtain the nonce, which is available in the dashboard via the `license` JS variable."
