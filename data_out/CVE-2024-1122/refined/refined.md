**Vulnerability Description:**
The Event Manager, Events Calendar, Events Tickets for WooCommerce â€“ Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the `export_data()` function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to export event data.

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability exposes the event data to unauthenticated users due to the missing capability check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to export sensitive event data without needing to be logged in or having administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network as an unauthenticated user can send a request to trigger the vulnerable function.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The code snippets show the presence of `$_GET['etn-action']` and `$_GET['post_type']`, suggesting that a crafted HTTP GET request could be used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
