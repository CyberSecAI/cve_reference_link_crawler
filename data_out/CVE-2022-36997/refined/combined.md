### VTS22-004

# HotFix for Security Advisory Impacting NetBackup – Primary/Media Server

### Revision History

* 1.0: July 18: Initial Release

### Summary

Veritas has addressed multiple security vulnerabilities impacting Veritas NetBackup, NetBackup Appliance, Flex Appliance, and Flex Scale. If you are at an earlier release of NetBackup, you will need to first upgrade to a version where a HotFix is available and then apply the appropriate HotFix. Table 2 of this advisory lists the high-level description. Click the Description hyperlink in Table 2 for more detail on each vulnerability.

**Affected products/versions:**

* NetBackup 8.1.x, 8.2, 8.3.x, 9.0.x, 9.1.x
* NetBackup Appliance/NetBackup Virtual Appliance 3.1.x, 3.2, 3.2 MRs, 3.3.0.1, 3.3.0.x MRs, 4.0, 4.0.0.1 MRs, 4.1, 4.1.0.1 MRs
* NetBackup 8.1.x, 8.2, 8.3.x, 9.0.x, 9.1.x Containers on Flex Appliance 1.3.x, 2.0, 2.0.x, 2.1
* Flex Scale 1.3.1, 2.1

**HotFixes are available for the following NetBackup versions:**

* NetBackup 8.1.2, 8.2, 8.3.0.1, 8.3.0.2, 9.0.0.1, 9.1.0.1

**Remedial Actions:**

* Review Table 1 below to identify your current NetBackup Enterprise software version and follow the remediation steps to apply the HotFix, or upgrade to a version where a fix is available.
* To fix ALL issues listed below we recommend applying the HotFix to Primary servers as well as all Media servers. This HotFix may be safely applied to all NetBackup Media servers.
* Flex Appliance customers, please apply the NetBackup HotFix corresponding to the NetBackup Container version on Flex appliances.
* Flex Scale Appliance customers, please contact [Veritas Technical Support](https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/manageCases) and reference Knowledge Article ID 100053006 to obtain a fix.

### Note

You may also use the [NetBackup HotFix and EEB Release Auditor on SORT](https://sort.veritas.com/netbackuphfauditor) to check if a previous Emergency Engineering Binary (EEB) or HotFix was delivered in a released product version. This information is also available in the NetBackup Emergency Engineering Binary Guide for that version. If you do not see information related to a HotFix or an EEB you expected, please contact Veritas Technical Support.
