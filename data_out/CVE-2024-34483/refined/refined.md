Based on the provided information, this issue report describes a vulnerability that can cause an infinite loop in the Ryu SDN controller.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `OFPGroupDescStats` parser in `ryu/ofproto/ofproto_v1_3_parser.py` (and also present in v1.4 and v1.5) contains a `while` loop that iterates through buckets in a group description. The loop increments the `offset` and `length` variables by the length of the parsed bucket (`bucket.len`). If a crafted packet is sent where a bucket's length (`OFPBucket.len`) is zero, the offset and length will not change, leading to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite loop vulnerability in the `OFPGroupDescStats` parser.
- Lack of proper input validation on the length of the `OFPBucket`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The infinite loop can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially crashing the Ryu controller or making it unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted OpenFlow packet with an `OFPGroupDescStats` structure containing an `OFPBucket` with a length of 0.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send OpenFlow packets to the Ryu controller, meaning they need to be a connected client of the controller. The attacker must have knowledge of the OpenFlow protocol and the structure of `OFPGroupDescStats` and `OFPBucket`.
