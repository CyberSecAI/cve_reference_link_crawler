- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An XSS vulnerability exists in the Cobalt Strike teamserver. It's triggered by a malformed username within the Beacon configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The teamserver does not properly validate the username field in the Beacon configuration, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to remotely execute code on the teamserver.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be able to set a malformed username in the Beacon configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to influence or modify the Beacon configuration to include a malformed username.
