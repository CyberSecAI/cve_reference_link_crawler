{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a fixed JWT key in the TokenVerify.php middleware.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass due to the use of a hard-coded JWT key.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain admin-level access by creating a valid JWT token and setting it in localStorage. This allows for unauthorized access and potential misuse of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker leverages a script using the fixed JWT key to generate a valid admin-level token.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to generate a token using the fixed key and then set the token in the browser's local storage."
