Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-23487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient audit logging within IBM Db2. This means that certain actions or events within the database system are not being properly recorded in the audit logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Audit Logging:** The core issue is the lack of comprehensive logging, making it difficult to track and analyze potentially malicious activities within the Db2 database environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is the inability to detect and investigate unauthorized activities. The absence of complete audit trails can hinder security incident response and forensic analysis.
*   Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, the lack of proper logging could potentially facilitate other attacks by making it more difficult to detect and track malicious activities and data breaches.
*   NetApp's advisory summarizes that exploitation of vulnerabilities including CVE-2023-23487 could lead to "disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS)".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The IBM bulletin doesn't specify the exact attack vector. However, it implies that the vulnerability can be triggered by any action within the Db2 database that is not properly logged.
*   NetApp's advisory gives the CVSS vector as AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U indicating that the attack vector is network-based, with low attack complexity and requires low privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need access to the Db2 database in order to perform the actions that aren't properly logged.
*   The CVSS vector indicates that a low privileged user can exploit this vulnerability.
*  The IBM bulletin does not state whether or not authentication is required for this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   IBM does not disclose the exact functionality or replication steps of the vulnerability to prevent potential exploitation.
*   The vulnerability affects IBM Db2 versions 11.1.4.7 and 11.5.x on all platforms.
*   Fixes are available as special builds for specific fix pack levels, which can be applied to any affected fixpack level of the appropriate release.

In summary, CVE-2023-23487 is caused by insufficient audit logging in IBM Db2, which can prevent the detection of malicious activities. An attacker with low privileges and access to the network can exploit this vulnerability with low complexity.
