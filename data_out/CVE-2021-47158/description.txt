In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: sja1105: add error handling in sja1105_setup()

If any of sja1105_static_config_load(), sja1105_clocking_setup() or
sja1105_devlink_setup() fails, we can't just return in the middle of
sja1105_setup() or memory will leak. Add a cleanup path.
