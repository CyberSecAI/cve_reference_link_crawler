- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Lima DRM driver uses a shared interrupt. During driver removal, the clocks are disabled before the interrupts are unregistered. The interrupt handlers access device registers, assuming clocks are enabled, leading to a potential crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the incorrect order of operations during driver removal. The shared interrupt remains registered while the necessary clocks are disabled. This violates the assumption that clocks are enabled when interrupt handlers access device registers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is a potential kernel crash when the Lima DRM driver is removed, especially when `CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ` is enabled.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the removal of the Lima DRM driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to trigger the removal of the Lima DRM driver.
