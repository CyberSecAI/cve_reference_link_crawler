Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-28965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `REXML` gem (library) bundled with Ruby.
- When parsing and serializing a crafted XML document, `REXML` can create an incorrect XML document with a different structure than the original. This is an XML round-trip vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Round-Trip Issue:** The core weakness is the failure of `REXML` to correctly preserve the structure of an XML document during parsing and serialization. This means that the XML output is not guaranteed to match the input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification:** Successful exploitation can lead to the addition or modification of data due to the altered XML structure.
- **Context-Dependent Impact:** The severity of the impact depends heavily on the context and how the application uses REXML. It might lead to vulnerabilities in programs relying on REXML.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted XML Document:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted XML document as input to a vulnerable application using REXML.
- **Parsing and Serialization:** The vulnerability is triggered during the process of parsing the crafted XML document and subsequently serializing it back into XML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Malicious XML:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML document to an application that uses the vulnerable REXML library.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Ruby Versions:**
    - Ruby 2.5.8 or prior (cannot use `gem update rexml`)
    - Ruby 2.6.6 or prior
    - Ruby 2.7.2 or prior
    - Ruby 3.0.0
    - REXML gem 3.2.4 or prior
- **Mitigation:**
    - Upgrade Ruby to versions 2.6.7, 2.7.3, or 3.0.1 or later.
    - Alternatively, update the `rexml` gem to version 3.2.5 or later (except for Ruby 2.5.8 or prior)
- **NetApp Products:** Although the vulnerability is in Ruby, NetApp explicitly states that their products are not affected. This implies they either do not use the vulnerable versions of ruby/REXML or they have mitigated the issue in other ways.
