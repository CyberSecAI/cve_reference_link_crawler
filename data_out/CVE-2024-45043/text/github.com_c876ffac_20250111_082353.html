**Description:** The `awsfirehosereceiver` can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream. [Firehose sets the header](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html) `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on incoming requests. However, when this is configured it still accepts incoming requests with no key.
