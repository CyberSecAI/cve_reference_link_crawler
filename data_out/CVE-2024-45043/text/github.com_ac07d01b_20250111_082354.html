# AWS Firehose Receiver Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

Moderate

[arminru](/arminru)
published
GHSA-prf6-xjxh-p698
Aug 28, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/receiver/awsfirehosereceiver
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 0.49.0, < 0.108.0

## Patched versions

0.108.0

## Description

### Summary

OpenTelemetry Collector module [`awsfirehosereceiver`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/awsfirehosereceiver) allows unauthenticated remote requests, even when configured to require a key.

OpenTelemetry Collector can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream. [Firehose sets the header](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html) `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on incoming requests. However, when this is configured it **still accepts incoming requests with no key**.

### Impact

Only OpenTelemetry Collector users configured with the “[alpha](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#alpha)” `awsfirehosereceiver` module are affected. This module was [added](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/pull/74) in version v0.49.0 of the [“Contrib” distribution](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib) (or may be included in custom builds).

There is a risk of unauthorized users writing metrics. Carefully crafted metrics could hide other malicious activity. There is no risk of exfiltrating data. It’s likely these endpoints will be exposed to the public internet, as Firehose [does not support private HTTP endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-http).

### Fix

A fix was introduced in [#34847](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/34847) and released with v0.108.0 (<https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/tag/v0.108.0>).

### Details

Details
#### PoC

When simulating Firehose requests against vulnerable versions of the Collector, we can see “UNAUTHORIZED METRICS” printed to the console via the debug exporter.

(Note this script doesn’t run on some older still-vulnerable versions that do not have the “debug” exporter.)

```

#### Patch

The [`if` statement](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/v0.107.0/receiver/awsfirehosereceiver/receiver.go#L235) makes the access key header optional, rather than the configuration optional.

This has been patched in [#34847](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/34847) to separately handle the case where access\_key is not configured, and use a default-deny style:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
