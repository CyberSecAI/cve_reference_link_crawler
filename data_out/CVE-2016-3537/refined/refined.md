  "content": "The provided document is a Critical Patch Update Advisory from Oracle. It lists multiple CVEs that were fixed in the July 2016 patch update. This specific CVE is mentioned within the 'Oracle Supply Chain Products Suite Risk Matrix' section.\n\n**Vulnerability Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Component:** Oracle Agile PLM\n*   **Sub-component:** File Folders / Attachment\n*   **Protocol:** HTTP\n*   **Remote Exploit without Authentication:** No\n*   **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 6.5\n*   **Attack Vector:** Network\n*  **Attack Complexity:** Low\n*   **Privileges Required:** Low\n*   **User Interaction:** None\n*   **Scope:** Unchanged\n*   **Confidentiality Impact:** High\n*   **Integrity Impact:** None\n*   **Availability Impact:** None\n*   **Affected Versions:** 9.3.4, 9.3.5\n\n**Root Cause:** The specific cause is not detailed in the document, but it involves the handling of file folders and attachments within Oracle Agile PLM.\n\n**Weaknesses:** The vulnerability appears to stem from inadequate validation or processing of file folder and attachment data, allowing for potential unauthorized access or manipulation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a high confidentiality impact, meaning that an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, the listed integrity and availability impact is none, meaning data integrity should not be directly affected, and the system availability shouldn't be compromised. \n\n**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network based, meaning the attacker can try to exploit this vulnerability over a network. \n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would require low privileges to perform the attack and would need to target the application over the network. User interaction is not required, indicating the attack could be automated.\n\n**Note:** This entry does not detail the specific nature of the vulnerability, only the impact it can have. Additional details can likely be found in the linked support documents, but they are not included here."
