{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how WebKit handles Content Security Policy (CSP). Specifically, it allows maliciously crafted web content to bypass or prevent CSP enforcement.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper enforcement of Content Security Policy"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is that maliciously crafted web content can bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP), potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other vulnerabilities that CSP is designed to prevent. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a website, data theft or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted web content"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to serve or inject a specially crafted web page/content that exploits the WebKit CSP enforcement flaw. This may be accomplished by tricking a user to browse to a malicious website, inserting malicious code into a vulnerable website, or some other means of injecting malicious content into a context viewed by the user."
