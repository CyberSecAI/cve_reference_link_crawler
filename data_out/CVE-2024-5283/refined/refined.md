- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter (`wp_aff_referrer`) before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions. This is especially critical for high-privilege users like administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML file containing a form that submits a crafted `wp_aff_referrer` parameter to the vulnerable page. They trick an admin user into opening this HTML file in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTML file. The victim needs to be a logged-in administrator and be tricked into opening the attackerâ€™s HTML file.
