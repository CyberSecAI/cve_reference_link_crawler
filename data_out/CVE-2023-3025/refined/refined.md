Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-3025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `fetch_url` function within the `Principal.php` file. This function is used to retrieve content from a provided URL, and it does not properly validate or sanitize the provided 'link' parameter in the shortcode, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin is vulnerable to SSRF because it allows an attacker to control the URL used in a server-side request via the 'link' parameter. The plugin fetches the content of the provided link, and this could be to an internal resource.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially use the SSRF vulnerability to access sensitive information from internal services or resources not publicly accessible by making requests to them.
- **Internal Service Manipulation:** An attacker could modify internal service information if internal services do not require authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the `link` parameter used in the plugin's shortcode. By crafting a malicious URL and using the plugin's shortcode, an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered by an AJAX call to the `ajaxGetHeaders` and `ajaxReplaceShortcode` functions. The `ajaxGetHeaders` function passes the unsanitized URL to the `fetch_url` function, which retrieves the content from the URL specified by the attacker. The `ajaxReplaceShortcode` function uses shortcode attributes, which are extracted from user-controlled input from the `$_POST` array (which may be controlled by the user through the AJAX request), that then calls `get_folder` function that retrieves external data via the `fetch_url` function..

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the capability to craft malicious URLs to target internal or sensitive resources and supply those URLs as the value for the `link` parameter.
