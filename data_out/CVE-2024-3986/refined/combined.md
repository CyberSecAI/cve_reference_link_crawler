## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SportsPress < 2.7.22 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Add a Venue (/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=sp\_venue&post\_type=sp\_event) and put the following payload in the Address field: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>

### Affects Plugins
