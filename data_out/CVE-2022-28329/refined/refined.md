- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices do not properly handle malformed TCP packets received over the RemoteCapture feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could cause a denial of service condition, which only affects the port used by the RemoteCapture feature.
- **Attack vectors**: Malformed TCP packets sent over the RemoteCapture feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network (adjacent) as the affected device and able to send network traffic to it. No specific user interaction is required. The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
