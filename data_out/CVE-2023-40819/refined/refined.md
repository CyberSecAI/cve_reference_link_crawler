- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `message` parameter in the `error` endpoint of the id4Portais application is not sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized user input leading to HTML injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML, which could lead to phishing attacks, drive-by downloads, or defacement of the error page. In the provided example, the attacker injects a hyperlink.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via a crafted URL with a malicious payload within the `message` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and send it to the victim. No authentication is required.
