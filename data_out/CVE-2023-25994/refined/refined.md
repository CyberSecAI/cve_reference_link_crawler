- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability that allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially force a logged-in user with high privileges to perform actions they did not intend, by crafting a malicious request that exploits the user's active session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted request sent to the vulnerable WordPress plugin that exploits the user's authenticated session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The user must have an active authenticated session with the affected website.
