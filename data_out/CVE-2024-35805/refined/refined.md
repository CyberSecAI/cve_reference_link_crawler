Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits, which is related to CVE-2024-35805:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a potential lockup within the `dm_exception_table_exit` function in the Device Mapper (DM) snapshot module of the Linux kernel. This function is responsible for freeing exceptions when a snapshot is being removed. The loop that frees these exceptions could potentially run for an extended period, especially with a large number of exceptions, causing the system to lock up.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unbounded Loop:** The original code iterated through the exception table and freed the exceptions without yielding the CPU. This resulted in a loop that, under certain circumstances (large number of exceptions) could hog the CPU causing a lockup condition.
- **Lack of CPU Yielding:**  The absence of `cond_resched()` in the loop prevents the kernel from scheduling other processes/tasks during the exception freeing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. When exiting a DM snapshot with numerous exceptions, the kernel thread responsible for freeing the exceptions would lock up. This would halt the system or make it unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Directly by creating a snapshot:** An attacker could create a device mapper snapshot with a large number of exceptions and then attempt to exit the snapshot.
- **Indirectly by manipulating snapshots:** Through indirect manipulation of snapshots using a device mapper.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would require the ability to create and manage device mapper snapshots. This may necessitate root or administrative access, depending on system configuration.

**Patch Details:**

The fix involves adding `cond_resched()` within the loop of the `dm_exception_table_exit` function. This ensures the kernel yields the CPU periodically, preventing a complete lockup. The added line is as follows:

```c
cond_resched();
```
This ensures the kernel scheduler has a chance to execute other processes and helps prevent a complete system freeze.

**Summary:**

The identified vulnerability is a denial-of-service issue due to a missing `cond_resched()` call in a loop that frees DM snapshot exceptions. The fix was to add this call to ensure the loop is interruptible by the kernel scheduler, thus resolving the lockup problem.
