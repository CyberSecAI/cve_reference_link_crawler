Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4203

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Ping" tool of the Advantech EKI-15XX series firmware, allowing injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The "Ping" tool's input fields are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the HTTP GET request.
- Specifically, the `ip` parameter in the `/cgi-bin/ping.sh` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session.
- This could potentially lead to:
    - Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
    - Defacement of the web interface.
    - Redirecting the victim to malicious websites.
    - Other malicious activities depending on the access level of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/ping.sh` endpoint.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `ip` parameter of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's web interface.
- The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the device.
- The attacker needs no prior authentication, as long as they can access the web interface.
- The user must have logged into the web interface and have an active session for the injected script to be executed in their context.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Advantech EKI-1524-CE series, EKI-1522 series, EKI-1521 series with firmware versions <= 1.24.

**Fixed Version:**
- Firmware version 1.26.
