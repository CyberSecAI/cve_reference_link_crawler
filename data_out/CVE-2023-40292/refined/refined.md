{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The infotainment system's Carplay functionality sends out broadcast requests that leak the device's IP address. Additionally, the system has an exposed DBus service accessible over the network without proper authentication, and SSH is enabled with a weak default password in some versions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leakage: The Carplay service broadcasts packets that reveal the device's IP address.",
      "Insecure Network Service: DBus service is exposed over the network without authentication.",
        "Weak SSH Configuration: Older versions have SSH enabled with a weak default root password.",
      "Lack of Rate Limiting: SSH service does not have rate limiting enabled, making brute-force attacks easier.",
       "Root login allowed over SSH with password: Allowing root login with password."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the infotainment system, potentially leading to various impacts such as:\n\t* Denial of Service (DoS) by sending excessive TCP packets.\n\t* Rebooting the infotainment system.\n\t* Modifying device settings, such as toggling warning lights, via DBus.\n\t* Executing arbitrary functions through the DBus interface including telephony, networking, and display controls.\n\t* In older versions gaining root shell access to the system via SSH to further compromise the system",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "USB-to-Ethernet Connection: An attacker can connect to the infotainment system's network via a USB-to-Ethernet adapter.",
      "Network Exploitation: The attacker exploits the leaked IP to establish a TCP/IP connection.",
      "DBus Exploitation: The attacker uses the open DBus service to send RPC commands.",
      "SSH Exploitation: In older versions, the attacker can log into the system using the default password."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires physical access to the vehicle to connect via USB. The attacker also needs a basic understanding of networking and the ability to use tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and DBus client libraries. OSINT skills to identify the internal project name of the vehicle for password recovery is also needed."
