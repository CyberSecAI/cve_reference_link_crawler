Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability addressed in the commits, specifically focusing on the changes in commit `51cd1b39de5643836e62661d162c472d63167df7`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way TCPDF handled the `<tcpdf>` HTML tag. This tag allowed calling arbitrary TCPDF methods directly from HTML content, which, if user-controlled, could be exploited to execute unintended actions or potentially access sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unrestricted Method Calls:** The primary weakness was that any TCPDF method could be called using the `<tcpdf>` tag, without any restrictions or sanitization.
2.  **Insecure Parameter Handling:**  Although the commit message mentions that the parameters for the 'params' attribute of TCPDF tag must be prepared as an array and encoded with the `serializeTCPDFtagParameters()`, this method still resulted in insecure handling.
3.  **Lack of Input Validation:** There wasn't proper validation on the method names or parameters supplied through the `tcpdf` tag, allowing potential malicious method calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could:

1.  **Manipulate Document Generation:** Inject malicious HTML containing `<tcpdf>` tags to alter the generated PDF content in unexpected ways.
2.  **Execute Unintended TCPDF Functions:** By calling specific TCPDF methods, an attacker could potentially perform actions that the application's user interface did not intend.
3.  **Potentially gain information:** By calling certain methods, an attacker might be able to extract or expose potentially sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Injection via User-Controlled HTML:** The primary attack vector is injecting malicious HTML containing `<tcpdf>` tags, via user input that is then rendered into the PDF.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the application using TCPDF allows users to input HTML content that's then included in PDFs without proper sanitization, XSS could be leveraged to inject malicious `<tcpdf>` tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **HTML Injection:** The attacker must be able to inject HTML content into the application. This means they must be able to control the HTML content that is passed to the `WriteHTML()` function in TCPDF.
2.  **Knowledge of TCPDF methods:** Some knowledge of TCPDF's methods would be needed in order to craft a working payload.

**Mitigation:**

The fix, introduced in commit `51cd1b39de5643836e62661d162c472d63167df7`, includes the following:

1.  **`K_ALLOWED_TCPDF_TAGS` Constant:** A new configuration constant `K_ALLOWED_TCPDF_TAGS` was introduced. This constant specifies which TCPDF methods are allowed to be called via the `<tcpdf>` tag, effectively whitelisting safe methods. By default, this is an empty array.
2.  **`allowedTCPDFtag` method**:  The `allowedTCPDFtag` method was added to check if the method being called is in the whitelist.
3.  **`serializeTCPDFtag` and `unserializeTCPDFtag`**: The `serializeTCPDFtag` and `unserializeTCPDFtag` methods and attributes were introduced as a preferred method for calling TCPDF methods through HTML.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message notes a "breaking change," which is that the way the `<tcpdf>` tag is used has changed. The `params` attribute must now be an array and serialized using the `serializeTCPDFtagParameters()` method, and this has been changed to a new `data` attribute.
*   The commit also introduces a warning indicating that this tag should be considered unsafe if the HTML content is user-generated, which is disabled by default by the `K_TCPDF_CALLS_IN_HTML` constant.
*   The commit description indicates this was a security fix, with the intention to restrict the use of `<tcpdf>` tags and the arbitrary calling of methods from within HTML content.

In summary, the identified vulnerability allowed for arbitrary method execution through the `<tcpdf>` tag. The mitigation restricts which methods can be called and recommends disabling the feature if processing user-generated HTML to prevent malicious actors from exploiting it.
