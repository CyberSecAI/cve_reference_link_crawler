- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hidden and hard-coded credentials for a super-admin user ("prolionadmin") with a weak, guessable password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Hard-coded credentials
    - Weak password
    - Hidden user account not visible in the user management interface
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful login to the web management interface with super-admin privileges, allowing access to all functions and the most privileged REST API endpoints. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access to the web management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the username "prolionadmin" and the weak password. It is implied that the attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web interface.
