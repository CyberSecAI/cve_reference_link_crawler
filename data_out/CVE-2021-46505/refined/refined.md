- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow occurs due to excessive recursion in `Jsi_NameLookup` and `jsi_ValueSubscript` functions within the jsish interpreter. This is triggered by repeatedly calling `Array.prototype.push.call(a, 42, 43)` within the `JSEtest` function called in a loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by unbounded recursion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The stack overflow leads to a crash of the jsish interpreter, which can cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted JavaScript code that involves a recursive lookup operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute jsish interpreter with the crafted script.
