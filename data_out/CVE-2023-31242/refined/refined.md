- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OAS Engine, by default, does not have an admin application user set. Without this, no authentication is required to access functionalities that should require valid credentials, including creating new users. Additionally, if an admin user is created but the configuration is not saved before the OAS Engine restarts, the changes are lost and the system reverts to ignoring the authentication structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, authentication bypass. The system fails to enforce authentication when no admin user is set or if the configuration is not saved after creating an admin user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass authentication, create new users, and gain access to the underlying system. This can lead to complete control of the OAS platform, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate connected devices, databases, and cloud services.
- **Attack vectors**: A series of specially crafted network requests can be sent to trigger the vulnerability. Specifically, sending an `OASPacket` with `CommandNumber` of 0x13F allows for checking if unauthenticated access is possible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable OAS Engine. No prior authentication or specific privileges are required.
