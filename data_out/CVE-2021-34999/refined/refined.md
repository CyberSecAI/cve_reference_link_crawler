- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper initialization of memory within the implementation of multicast routing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uninitialized memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can disclose sensitive information from kernel memory. In conjunction with other vulnerabilities, this could lead to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution in the context of the kernel.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. The attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to execute low-privileged code.
