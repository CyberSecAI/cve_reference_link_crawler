# Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in conf-web/settings REST endpoint

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-0717

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-36997](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36997)

**Published:** 2024-07-01

**Last Update:** 2024-07-01

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 4.6, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-8007

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312, an admin user could store and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser context of another Splunk user through the conf-web/settings REST endpoint. This could potentially cause a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) exploit.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.2 | Splunk Web | 9.2.0 to 9.2.1 | 9.2.2 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.1 | Splunk Web | 9.1.0 to 9.1.4 | 9.1.5 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | Splunk Web | 9.0.0 to 9.0.9 | 9.0.10 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.1.2312 | Splunk Web | Below 9.1.2312.100 | 9.1.2312.100 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

The vulnerability is likely to affect instances with [Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) turned on. You could turn Splunk Web off as a possible workaround. See [Disable unnecessary Splunk Enterprise components](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) and the [web.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Webconf) configuration specification file for more information on turning Splunk Web off.

## Detections

* [Splunk Stored XSS conf-web settings on prem](https://research.splunk.com/application/ed1209ef-228d-4dab-9856-be9369925a5c)

## Severity

Splunk rates this vulnerability as 4.6, Medium, with a CVSSv3.1 vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

If the Splunk Enterprise instance does not run Splunk Web, there is no impact and the severity is Informational.

# Detection: Splunk Stored XSS conf-web Settings on Premises

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: ed1209ef-228d-4dab-9856-be9369925a5c
Author: Rod Soto, Chase Franklin
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

This hunting detection provides information on exploitation of stored XSS against /configs/conf-web/settings by an admin level user.

### Search

```
1`splunk_python` *script* *eval*
2| stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by index, sourcetype, host
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_stored_xss_conf_web_settings_on_premises_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_stored\_xss\_conf\_web\_settings\_on\_premises\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_stored_xss_conf_web_settings_on_premises_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and will produce false positives, operator must identify XSS elemetns in the splunk\_python log related to the vulnerable endpoint.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible XSS attack against $host$ | 20 | 20 | 100 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
