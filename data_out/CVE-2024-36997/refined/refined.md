Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-36997

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `conf-web/settings` REST endpoint within Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A malicious administrator can store JavaScript code via the vulnerable REST endpoint. This stored code can then be executed in the browser context of other users who access affected pages. This means the XSS is persistent and doesn't require a specific crafted link to trigger.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of other Splunk users.
- **Potential for Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information such as session cookies or other data available to the user's browser.
- **Account Hijacking:** Malicious scripts can potentially be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Manipulation of Splunk Interface:** Malicious scripts can modify the user interface of the application to potentially phish for credentials or cause other harm.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API:** The attack is carried out through the `conf-web/settings` REST endpoint.
- **Admin Level Access:** Requires a user with administrative privileges to inject the malicious code.
- **Browser-based Execution:** The malicious code is executed within the browsers of other users when they access affected areas of the Splunk application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a Splunk administrator or have elevated permissions that allow access and modification of settings through the `conf-web/settings` REST endpoint.
- **Network Access to Splunk Instance:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Splunk instance.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.
- Splunk has provided a detection query to find possible exploitation attempts of the vulnerability.
- Mitigation includes either upgrading Splunk to the patched versions or disabling Splunk Web, a core component of the Splunk platform.
