# Detection: Splunk Stored XSS conf-web Settings on Premises

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: ed1209ef-228d-4dab-9856-be9369925a5c
Author: Rod Soto, Chase Franklin
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

This hunting detection provides information on exploitation of stored XSS against /configs/conf-web/settings by an admin level user.

### Search

```
1`splunk_python` *script* *eval*
2| stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by index, sourcetype, host
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_stored_xss_conf_web_settings_on_premises_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_stored\_xss\_conf\_web\_settings\_on\_premises\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_stored_xss_conf_web_settings_on_premises_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and will produce false positives, operator must identify XSS elemetns in the splunk\_python log related to the vulnerable endpoint.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible XSS attack against $host$ | 20 | 20 | 100 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
