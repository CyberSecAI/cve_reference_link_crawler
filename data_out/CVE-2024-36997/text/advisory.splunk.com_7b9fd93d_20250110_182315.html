**CWE:** [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-8007

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312, an admin user could store and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser context of another Splunk user through the conf-web/settings REST endpoint. This could potentially cause a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) exploit.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.
