Add test coverage for --persist

This adds three "positive" tests: the common case --persist=.persist, the
deprecated spelling --persist=/.persist, and the less common special case
--persist=. as used by Steam.

It also adds "negative" tests for CVE-2024-42472: if the --persist
directory is a symbolic link or contains path segment "..", we want that
to be rejected.

persist directories: Pass using new bwrap --bind-fd option

[Browse files](/flatpak/flatpak/tree/6bd603f6836e9b38b9b937d3b78f3fbf36e7ff75)

```
Instead of passing a /proc/self/fd bind mount we use --bind-fd, which
has two advantages:
 * bwrap closes the fd when used, so it doesn't leak into the started app
 * bwrap ensures that what was mounted was the passed in fd (same dev/ino),
   as there is a small (required) gap between symlink resolve and mount
   where the target path could be replaced.

Please note that this change requires an updated version of bubblewrap.

Yes! Trying to run ----- flatpak run <flatpak.application> results in error with "Unkown option --bind-fd". Fixed when updated bubblewrap package installs.

Don't follow symlinks when mounting persisted directories

```
These directories are in a location under application control, so we
can't trust them to not be a symlink outside of the files accessibe to
the application.

Continue to treat --persist=/foo as --persist=foo for backwards compat,
since this is how it (accidentally) worked before, but print a warning.

Don't allow ".." elements in persist paths: these would not be useful
anyway, and are unlikely to be in use, however they could potentially
be used to confuse the persist path handling.

This partially addresses CVE-2024-42472. If only one instance of the
malicious or compromised app is run at a time, the vulnerability
is avoided. If two instances can run concurrently, there is a
time-of-check/time-of-use issue remaining, which can only be resolved
with changes to bubblewrap; this will be resolved in a separate commit,
because the bubblewrap dependency might be more difficult to provide in
LTS distributions.

# CVE-2024-42472: Access to files outside sandbox for apps using persistent= (--persist)

High

[smcv](/smcv)
published
GHSA-7hgv-f2j8-xw87
Aug 14, 2024

## Package

Flatpak
(freedesktop.org)

## Affected versions

all ≤ 1.14.8, 1.15x ≤ 1.15.9

## Patched versions

1.14.x ≥ 1.14.10, all ≥ 1.15.10

## Description

Chris Williams discovered an issue with how flatpak mounts persistent directories, which can allow an application using them to access host files.

### Impact

A malicious or compromised Flatpak app using persistent directories could read and write files in locations it would not normally have access to, which is an attack on integrity and confidentiality.

### Description

When `persistent=subdir` is used in the application permissions (represented as `--persist=subdir` in the command-line interface), that means that an application which otherwise doesn't have access to the real user home directory will see an empty home directory with a writeable subdirectory `subdir`. Behind the scenes, this directory is actually a bind mount and the data is stored in the per-application directory as `~/.var/app/$APPID/subdir`. This allows existing apps that are not aware of the per-application directory to still work as intended without general home directory access.

However, the application does have write access to the application directory `~/.var/app/$APPID` where this directory is stored. If the source directory for the `persistent`/`--persist` option is replaced by a symlink, then the next time the application is started, the bind mount will follow the symlink and mount whatever it points to into the sandbox.

For example, `org.mozilla.Thunderbird` has `persistent=.thunderbird`, and is not meant to be able to access `~/.ssh`.

In this example, `%` represents a shell prompt on the host system, and `$` represents a shell prompt inside the app sandbox.

```
% flatpak run --command=sh org.mozilla.Thunderbird
$ mv ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/.thunderbird{,.save}
$ ln -s ~/.ssh ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/.thunderbird
$ exit
% flatpak run --command=sh org.mozilla.Thunderbird
$ ls ~/.thunderbird
{contents of ~/.ssh/}

```
### Patches

Partial protection against this vulnerability can be provided by patching Flatpak:

  + Backport for 1.14.x and older: [8a18137d](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/8a18137d7e80f0575e8defabf677d81e5cc3a788)
* [2cdd1e1e "Add test coverage for --persist"](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/2cdd1e1e5ae90d7c3a4b60ce2e36e4d609e44e72)
  + Backport for 1.14.x and older: [db3a7852](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/db3a785241fda63bf53f0ec12bb519aa5210de19)

However, this leaves a race condition that could be exploited by two instances of a malicious app running in parallel. Closing the race condition requires updating or patching the version of bubblewrap that is used by Flatpak to add the new `--bind-fd` option:

* [a253257c "Add --bind-fd and --ro-bind-fd to let you bind a O\_PATH fd"](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/commit/a253257cd298892da43e15201d83f9a02c9b58b5), available in bubblewrap ≥ 0.10.0
  + Backport available in bubblewrap 0.6.x ≥ 0.6.3: [68e75c30](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/commit/68e75c3091c87583c28a439b45c45627a94d622c)

and then patching Flatpak to use it:

* [6bd603f6 "persist directories: Pass using new bwrap --bind-fd option"](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6bd603f6836e9b38b9b937d3b78f3fbf36e7ff75)
  + Backport for 1.14.x and older: [7c63e53b](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/7c63e53bb2af0aae9097fd2edfd6a9ba9d453e97)

If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.15.x) or `--with-system-bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.14.x or older), or a similar option, then the version of bubblewrap that needs to be patched or updated is a system copy that is distributed separately, typically `/usr/bin/bwrap`. This configuration is the one that is typically used in Linux distributions.

If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=` (1.15.x) or with `--without-system-bubblewrap` (1.14.x or older), then it is the bundled version of bubblewrap that is included with Flatpak that must be patched. This is typically installed as `/usr/libexec/flatpak-bwrap`. This configuration is the default when building from source code.

For the 1.14.x stable branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.14.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap included in this release has been updated to 0.6.3.

For the 1.15.x development branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.15.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap in this release is a Meson "wrap" subproject, which has been updated to 0.10.0.

The 1.12.x and 1.10.x branches have reached end-of-life and will not receive new releases for this vulnerability. Long-term support OS distributions should update to newer versions if their stability policy allows it, or backport the individual changes into their versions of Flatpak and bubblewrap (the backported versions from Flatpak 1.14.x are more compatible with older GLib releases).

### Compatibility issues

If users have manually replaced a Flatpak app's persistent directory with a symlink, the persistent directory will now be ignored for security reasons, and the most likely result is that the app will fail to save its state. If an affected app is run from a terminal with `flatpak run`, Flatpak will show a warning message similar to:

`F: Failed to create persist path foobar: Symbolic link "foobar" not allowed to avoid sandbox escape`

and the persistent directory will not be used.

If users find that they need to move persistent directories onto another filesystem due to lack of space, using bind mounts for this purpose is preferable to using symlinks.

### Workarounds

This only affects applications using the `persistent` (`--persist`) permission. You can list all apps using this feature like this:

```
$ for app in $(flatpak list --app --columns=application | tail -n +1) ; do \
    flatpak info -m $app | grep persistent= -H --label="$app"; \
done

```

Don't follow symlinks when mounting persisted directories

```
These directories are in a location under application control, so we
can't trust them to not be a symlink outside of the files accessibe to
the application.

Continue to treat --persist=/foo as --persist=foo for backwards compat,
since this is how it (accidentally) worked before, but print a warning.

Don't allow ".." elements in persist paths: these would not be useful
anyway, and are unlikely to be in use, however they could potentially
be used to confuse the persist path handling.

This partially addresses CVE-2024-42472. If only one instance of the
malicious or compromised app is run at a time, the vulnerability
is avoided. If two instances can run concurrently, there is a
time-of-check/time-of-use issue remaining, which can only be resolved
with changes to bubblewrap; this will be resolved in a separate commit,
because the bubblewrap dependency might be more difficult to provide in
LTS distributions.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Add --bind-fd and --ro-bind-fd to let you bind a O\_PATH fd.

This is useful for example if you for some reason don't have the real
path. It is also a way to make bind-mounts race-free (i.e. to have the
mount actually be the thing you wanted to be mounted, avoiding issues
where some other process replaces the target in parallel with the bwrap
launch.

Unfortunately due to some technical details we can't actually directly
mount the dirfd, as they come from different user namespace which is not
permitted, but at least we can delay resolving the fd to a path as much as
possible, and then validate after mount that we actually mounted the right
thing.

This is useful for example if you for some reason don't have the real

possible, and then validate after mount that we actually mounted the right
thing.

This adds three "positive" tests: the common case --persist=.persist, the
deprecated spelling --persist=/.persist, and the less common special case
--persist=. as used by Steam.

It also adds "negative" tests for CVE-2024-42472: if the --persist
directory is a symbolic link or contains path segment "..", we want that
to be rejected.

Message-ID: <Zrzl1Vi_mmbZlEHJ@descent>
Date: Wed, 14 Aug 2024 18:13:57 +0100
From: Simon McVittie <smcv@...labora.com>
To: flatpak@...ts.freedesktop.org, oss-security@...ts.openwall.com

Subject: flatpak CVE-2024-42472: Access to files outside sandbox for apps
 using persistent= (--persist)

Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
desktop applications on Linux.

Chris Williams discovered an issue with how Flatpak mounts persistent
directories, which can allow an application using them to access host
files.

Advisory: <https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7hgv-f2j8-xw87>
Affected: all < 1.14.10, 1.15.x < 1.15.10
Fixed: 1.14.x >= 1.14.10, all >= 1.15.10

Impact
======

A malicious or compromised Flatpak app using persistent directories could
read and write files in locations it would not normally have access to,
which is an attack on integrity and confidentiality.

Description
===========

When persistent=subdir is used in the application permissions (represented
as --persist=subdir in the command-line interface), that means that
an application which otherwise doesn't have access to the real user
home directory will see an empty home directory with a writeable
subdirectory `subdir`. Behind the scenes, this directory is actually a
bind mount and the data is stored in the per-application directory as
~/.var/app/$APPID/subdir. This allows existing apps that are not aware of
the per-application directory to still work as intended without general
home directory access.

However, the application does have write access to the application
directory ~/.var/app/$APPID where this directory is stored. If the source
directory for the persistent/--persist option is replaced by a symlink,
then the next time the application is started, the bind mount will follow
the symlink and mount whatever it points to into the sandbox.

For example, org.mozilla.Thunderbird has persistent=.thunderbird, and is
not meant to be able to access ~/.ssh.  In this example, % represents a
shell prompt on the host system, and $ represents a shell prompt inside
the app sandbox.

% flatpak run --command=sh org.mozilla.Thunderbird
$ mv ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/.thunderbird{,.save}
$ ln -s ~/.ssh ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/.thunderbird
$ exit
% flatpak run --command=sh org.mozilla.Thunderbird
$ ls ~/.thunderbird
{contents of ~/.ssh/}

Patches
=======

This was fixed in Flatpak 1.14.10 (stable release branch) and 1.15.10
(development prerelease branch).

For details of backportable patches suitable
for inclusion in LTS distributions, please see
<<https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7hgv-f2j8-xw87>>.

Fully resolving this vulnerability requires adding a new --bind-fd option
to bubblewrap (a sandboxing component used by Flatpak) so that Flatpak
can avoid a time-of-check/time-of-use race condition. This feature was
added in bubblewrap 0.10.0, but can be backported. More details are
available via the link above.

Depending how Flatpak was configured at build time, the version of
bubblewrap that needs to be patched might either be separately installed
into the PATH (typically /usr/bin/bwrap from an OS vendor package),
or a bundled convenience copy that is private to Flatpak (typically
installed as /usr/libexec/flatpak-bwrap). The convenience copies that
are included in Flatpak versions 1.14.10 and 1.15.10 have been updated
to include the necessary feature.

Mitigations
===========

If patching bubblewrap is logistically difficult, a mitigation is to apply
only the patch "Don't follow symlinks when mounting persisted directories"
to Flatpak, and then avoid running two instances of the same untrusted
app at the same time; this should prevent the time-of-check/time-of-use
issue from being exploited.

Another mitigation is to avoid installing untrusted apps that have
the "persistent" sandboxing parameter set in their metadata, and also
avoid using `flatpak override --persist ...` to add that parameter to
untrusted apps.

persist directories: Pass using new bwrap --bind-fd option

```
Instead of passing a /proc/self/fd bind mount we use --bind-fd, which
has two advantages:
 * bwrap closes the fd when used, so it doesn't leak into the started app
 * bwrap ensures that what was mounted was the passed in fd (same dev/ino),
   as there is a small (required) gap between symlink resolve and mount
   where the target path could be replaced.

Please note that this change requires an updated version of bubblewrap.
