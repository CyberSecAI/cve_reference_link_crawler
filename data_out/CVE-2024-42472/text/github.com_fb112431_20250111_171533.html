persist directories: Pass using new bwrap --bind-fd option

```
Instead of passing a /proc/self/fd bind mount we use --bind-fd, which
has two advantages:
 * bwrap closes the fd when used, so it doesn't leak into the started app
 * bwrap ensures that what was mounted was the passed in fd (same dev/ino),
   as there is a small (required) gap between symlink resolve and mount
   where the target path could be replaced.

Please note that this change requires an updated version of bubblewrap.

Yes! Trying to run ----- flatpak run <flatpak.application> results in error with "Unkown option --bind-fd". Fixed when updated bubblewrap package installs.

Sorry, something went wrong.
