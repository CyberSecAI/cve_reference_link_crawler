Add test coverage for --persist

```
This adds three "positive" tests: the common case --persist=.persist, the
deprecated spelling --persist=/.persist, and the less common special case
--persist=. as used by Steam.

It also adds "negative" tests for CVE-2024-42472: if the --persist
directory is a symbolic link or contains path segment "..", we want that
to be rejected.

Reproduces: CVE-2024-42472, [GHSA-7hgv-f2j8-xw87](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7hgv-f2j8-xw87 "GHSA-7hgv-f2j8-xw87")
[smcv: Add "positive" tests]
[smcv: Exercise --persist=..]
[smcv: Assert that --persist with a symlink produces expected message]
