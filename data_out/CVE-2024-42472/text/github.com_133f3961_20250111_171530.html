This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Add --bind-fd and --ro-bind-fd to let you bind a O\_PATH fd.

```
This is useful for example if you for some reason don't have the real
path. It is also a way to make bind-mounts race-free (i.e. to have the
mount actually be the thing you wanted to be mounted, avoiding issues
where some other process replaces the target in parallel with the bwrap
launch.

Unfortunately due to some technical details we can't actually directly
mount the dirfd, as they come from different user namespace which is not
permitted, but at least we can delay resolving the fd to a path as much as
possible, and then validate after mount that we actually mounted the right
thing.
