- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A programming error in the QWeb rendering engine of Odoo 15.0 made some sensitive interfaces available to the template code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper sandboxing of the QWeb templating language, allowing access to sensitive interfaces from within template code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution, leading to privilege escalation on the hosting server. Attackers could access local files or modify files and execute processes.
- **Attack vectors**: Network exploitable through the uploading of crafted QWeb templates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated administrator or a privileged user account is required.
