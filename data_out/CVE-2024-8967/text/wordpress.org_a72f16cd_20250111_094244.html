## Description

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) is a technology that combines the best of mobile web and the best of mobile apps to create a superior mobile web experience. They are installed on the phone like a normal app (web app) and can be accessed from the home screen.

Users can come back to your website by launching the app from their home screen and interact with your website through an app-like interface. Your return visitors will experience almost-instant loading times and enjoy the great performance benefits of your PWA!

iWorks PWA makes it easy for you to convert your WordPress website into a Progressive Web App instantly!

Once this plugin is installed, users browsing your website from a supported mobile device will see a “Add To Home Screen” notice (from the bottom of the screen) and will be able to ‘install your website’ on the home screen of their device.

iWorks PWA allow to add shortcuts for context menu to be displayed by the operating system when a user engages with the web app’s icon.

iWorks PWA is easy to configure, it takes less than a minute to set-up your Progressive Web App!

## FAQ

### How can I translate manifest.json values?

It is only possible with WPML package.

1. Install and activate `WPML Multilingual CMS` and `WPML String Translation` plugins.
2. Save `manifest.json` data on `WP Admin` -> `Settings` -> `WPA`.
3. Open `WP Admin` -> `WPML` -> String translation`.
4. Select domain `iworks-pwa`.
5. Translate strings.

### How can I add a context menu?

The shortcuts member defines an array of shortcuts or links to key tasks or pages within a web app. A user agent can use these values to assemble a context menu to be displayed by the operating system when a user engages with the web app’s icon.

1. Install [Menu Icons by ThemeIsle](https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-icons/) plugin.
2. Go to WPA -> Appearance -> Menu.
3. Open “Menu Icon Setting” from the “Add menu items” column (it should be on the bottom).
4. Be sure you have “Image” checked.
5. Create a custom menu and set “Display location” to “PWA Shortcuts Menu”.
6. Add item.
7. Select icon – it is recommended that you use a single 192×192 pixel icon.
8. Save the menu.

### What is “Add to Home screen”?

Add to Home screen (or A2HS for short) is a feature available in modern browsers that allows a user to “install” a web app, ie. add a shortcut to their Home screen representing their favourite web app (or site) so they can subsequently access it with a single tap.

A2HS is supported in all mobile browsers, except iOS web view. It’s also supported in some Chromium desktop browsers.

It works well on the desktop. But then I went to my tablet, which is where I need to install the app I generated, and there the option to download via Chrome doesn’t appear. How can I do that?
