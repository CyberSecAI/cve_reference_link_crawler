Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect permission scope checks within the Tolgee platform when querying key and translation data via the API. Specifically, the `/v2/projects/translations` and `/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations` endpoints were returning translation data even when the API key lacked the necessary `translation.view` scope. Similarly, information about keys was being returned without the `keys.view` scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Scope Validation:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce the required `translation.view` and `keys.view` scopes for API keys accessing translation and key data.
*   **API Key Bypass:** API keys lacking the required permissions were able to bypass intended access controls and retrieve data they shouldn't have been able to access.
*   **Inconsistent Permission Checks**: There were inconsistencies in how permissions were checked with API keys vs users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to translation and key data. Specifically, sensitive data like translations and key metadata could be exposed to users who should not have access.
*   **Limited Scope:** The vulnerability only affected API keys generated by users who were authorized to `translation.view` or `keys.view`. Also, to retrieve the data, the user needed to have at least some project permission.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely through the API endpoints `/v2/projects/translations` and `/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations`.
*   **API Key Exploitation:** An attacker with a valid API key that was not granted the required scopes (but had at least some project permissions) could exploit this vulnerability by making requests to these endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid API Key:** The attacker requires a valid API key for the Tolgee platform. The API key must be associated with a user that has at least some project permissions.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoints: `/v2/projects/translations` and `/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations`.
*   **No special access:** The attacker only needs the aforementioned access to be able to retrieve unauthorized data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes the commit that fixed the vulnerability, demonstrating that permission checks were added to the affected endpoints.
*   The CVSS score of 2.7 indicates a low severity.
*   The fix involved modifications to `TranslationsController.kt`, `ApiKeyController.kt`, `PermissionService.kt`, `SecurityService.kt`, `ProjectAuthorizationInterceptor.kt`, and their corresponding tests.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.57.2 of the Tolgee platform.

In summary, this vulnerability allowed API keys with insufficient permissions to access sensitive translation and key data, due to a flaw in scope validation within the Tolgee platform's API.
