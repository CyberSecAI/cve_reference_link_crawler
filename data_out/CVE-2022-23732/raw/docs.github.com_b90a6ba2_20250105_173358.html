This helps check the state of the created database to understand the status and quality of performed analysis. The diagnostic information is available starting in <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases">version 2.5.6</a> of the <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/">CodeQL CLI</a>. You can see the detailed diagnostic information in the GitHub Actions logs for CodeQL. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/viewing-code-scanning-logs">Viewing code scanning logs</a>."</p></li><li class="f4"><p>Code scanning with CodeQL CLI now supports analyzing several languages during a single build. This makes it easier to run code analysis to use CI/CD systems other than GitHub Actions. The new mode of the <code>codeql database create</code> command is available starting <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases">version 2.5.6</a> of the <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/">CodeQL CLI</a>. For more information about setting this up, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/code-security/secure-coding/using-codeql-code-scanning-with-your-existing-ci-system/running-codeql-cli-in-your-ci-system">Installing CodeQL CLI in your CI system</a>."</p></li><li class="f4"><p>Code scanning alerts from all enabled tools are now shown in one consolidated list, so that you can easily prioritize across all alerts. You can view alerts from a specific tool by using the "Tool" filter, and the "Rule" and "Tag" filters will dynamically update based on your "Tool" selection.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>Code scanning with CodeQL now includes beta support for analyzing C++20 code. This is only available when building codebases with GCC on Linux. C++20 modules are not supported yet.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>The depth of CodeQL's analysis has been improved by adding support for more <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/">libraries and frameworks</a> and increasing the coverage of our existing library and framework models for several languages (<a href="https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/cpp">C++</a>, <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/javascript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/python">Python</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/java">Java</a>). As a result, CodeQL can now detect even more potential sources of untrusted user data, review the steps through which that data flows, and identify potentially dangerous sinks in which this data could end up. This results in an overall improvement of the quality of the code scanning alerts. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-07-01-codeql-code-scanning-now-recognizes-more-sources-and-uses-of-untrusted-user-data/">GitHub changelog</a>.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>Code scanning now shows <code>security-severity</code> levels for CodeQL security alerts. You can configure which <code>security-severity</code> levels will cause a check failure for a pull request. The severity level of security alerts can be <code>critical</code>, <code>high</code>, <code>medium</code>, or <code>low</code>. By default, any code scanning alerts with a <code>security-severity</code> of <code>critical</code> or <code>high</code> will cause a pull request check failure. </p>
<p>Additionally, you can now also configure which severity levels will cause a pull request check to fail for non-security alerts. You can configure this behavior at the repository level, and define whether alerts with the severity <code>error</code>, <code>warning</code>, or <code>note</code> will cause a pull request check to fail. By default, non-security code scanning alerts with a severity of <code>error</code> will cause a pull request check failure.</p>
<p>For more information see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure">Defining which alert severity levels cause pull request check failure</a>."</p>
<p><img src="https://github.github.com/docs-ghes-3.2/assets/cb-75229/images/enterprise/3.2/release-notes/code-scanning-alerts.png" alt="List of code scanning alerts with security levels"></p></li><li class="f4"><p>Improvements to the branch filter for code scanning alerts make it clearer which code scanning alerts are being displayed on the alerts page. By default, code scanning alerts are filtered to show alerts for the default branch of the repository only. You can use the branch filter to display the alerts on any of the non-default branches. Any branch filter that has been applied is shown in the search bar.</p>
<p>The search syntax has also been simplified to <code>branch:&lt;branch name&gt;</code>. This syntax can be used multiple times in the search bar to filter on multiple branches. The previous syntax, <code>ref:refs/heads/&lt;branch name&gt;</code>, is still supported, so any saved URLs will continue to work.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>Free text search is now available for code scanning alerts. You can search code scanning results to quickly find specific alerts without having to know exact search terms. The search is applied across the alert's name, description, and help text. The syntax is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single word returns all matches.</li>
<li>Multiple search words returns matches to either word.</li>
<li>Words in double quotes returns exact matches.</li>
<li>The keyword 'AND' returns matches to multiple words.</li>
</ul></li><li class="f4"><p>Secret scanning added patterns for 23 new service providers. For the updated list of supported secrets, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning">About secret scanning</a>."</p></li><h4 id="api-changes" class="PatchNotes_sectionHeading__bowZS text-bold f4"><a rel="" href="/enterprise-server@3.2/admin/release-notes#api-changes">API Changes</a></h4><li class="f4"><p>Pagination support has been added to the Repositories REST API's "compare two commits" endpoint, which returns a list of commits reachable from one commit or branch, but unreachable from another. The API can also now return the results for comparisons over 250 commits. For more information, see the "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/reference/commits#compare-two-commits">Commits</a>" REST API documentation and "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination">Traversing with pagination</a>."</p></li><li class="f4"><p>The REST API can now be used to programmatically resend or check the status of webhooks. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/reference/repos#webhooks">Repositories</a>," "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/reference/orgs#webhooks">Organizations</a>," and "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/reference/apps#webhooks">Apps</a>" in the REST API documentation.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>Improvements have been made to the code scanning and GitHub Advanced Security APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code scanning API now returns the CodeQL query version used for an analysis. This can be used to reproduce results or confirm that an analysis used the latest query. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/reference/code-scanning#list-code-scanning-alerts-for-a-repository">Code scanning</a>" in the REST API documentation.</li>
<li>Admin users can now use the REST API to enable or disable GitHub Advanced Security for repositories, using the <code>security_and_analysis</code> object on <code>repos/{org}/{repo}</code>. In addition, admin users can check whether Advanced Security is currently enabled for a repository by using a <code>GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}</code> request. These changes help you manage Advanced Security repository access at scale. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/reference/repos#update-a-repository">Repositories</a>" in the REST API documentation.</li>

You can configure which `security-severity` levels will cause a check failure for a pull request. The severity level of security alerts can be `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`. By default, any {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with a `security-severity` of `critical` or `high` will cause a pull request check failure. \n\nAdditionally, you can now also configure which severity levels will cause a pull request check to fail for non-security alerts. You can configure this behavior at the repository level, and define whether alerts with the severity `error`, `warning`, or `note` will cause a pull request check to fail. By default, non-security {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with a severity of `error` will cause a pull request check failure.\n\nFor more information see \"[Defining which alert severity levels cause pull request check failure](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure).\"\n\n![List of code scanning alerts with security levels](/assets/images/enterprise/3.2/release-notes/code-scanning-alerts.png)\n","Improvements to the branch filter for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts make it clearer which {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts are being displayed on the alerts page. By default, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts are filtered to show alerts for the default branch of the repository only. You can use the branch filter to display the alerts on any of the non-default branches. Any branch filter that has been applied is shown in the search bar.\n\nThe search syntax has also been simplified to `branch:\u003cbranch name\u003e`. This syntax can be used multiple times in the search bar to filter on multiple branches. The previous syntax, `ref:refs/heads/\u003cbranch name\u003e`, is still supported, so any saved URLs will continue to work.\n","Free text search is now available for code scanning alerts. You can search code scanning results to quickly find specific alerts without having to know exact search terms. The search is applied across the alert's name, description, and help text. The syntax is:\n\n- A single word returns all matches.\n- Multiple search words returns matches to either word.\n- Words in double quotes returns exact matches.\n- The keyword 'AND' returns matches to multiple words.\n","{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} added patterns for 23 new service providers.
