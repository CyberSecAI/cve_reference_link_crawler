<ul>
<li>GitHub Advanced Security customers can now view their active committer count and the remaining number of unused committer seats on their organization or enterprise account’s Billing page. If Advanced Security is purchased for an enterprise, administrators can also view the active committer seats which are being used by other organizations within their enterprise.

<li>GitHub Advanced Security customers can now view their active committer count for any Advanced Security enabled repositories on their organization or enterprise account's Billing page.

<ul>
<li>Users with Dependabot alerts enabled can see which of their repositories are impacted by a given vulnerability by navigating to its entry in the <a href="https://github.com/advisories">GitHub Advisory Database</a>. This feature is available in public beta. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/supply-chain-security/viewing-and-updating-vulnerable-dependencies-in-your-repository">Viewing and updating vulnerable dependencies in your repository</a>."</li>
<li>When a vulnerability is added to GitHub Advisory Database, you will no longer receive <a href="https://github.com/notifications">email and web notifications</a> for Dependabot alerts on low and moderate severity vulnerabilities. These alerts are still accessible from the repository's Security tab. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/supply-chain-security/viewing-and-updating-vulnerable-dependencies-in-your-repository">Viewing and updating vulnerable dependencies in your repository</a>."</li>
<li>You can now give people instructions on how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities in your project by adding a <code>SECURITY.md</code> file to your repository's <code>root</code>, <code>docs</code>, or <code>.github</code> folder. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's security policy.

We have introduced new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by moving <code>access_token</code> to the request body. While deprecated, the endpoints are still accessible in this version. We intend to remove these endpoints on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.

This may cause some workflows in your repository to break. To fix these workflows, you will need to update the action reference to use the full commit SHA.

Previously, if you had permission to view security alerts in a repository, you would receive notifications for that repository as long as your settings allowed for security alert notifications. Now, you must opt in to security alert notifications by watching the repository. You will be notified if you select `All Activity` or configure `Custom` to include `Security alerts`. All existing repositories will be automatically migrated to these new settings and you will continue to receive notifications; however, any new repositories will require opting-in by watching the repository. For more information see \"[Configuring notifications for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-notifications-for-dependabot-alerts)\" and \"[Managing alerts from secret scanning](/code-security/secret-security/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning).\""]},{"heading":"Code scanning and secret scanning changes","notes":["{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} now generates diagnostic information for all supported languages. This helps check the state of the created database to understand the status and quality of performed analysis. The diagnostic information is available starting in [version 2.5.6](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases) of the [{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql_cli %}](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/). You can see the detailed diagnostic information in the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} logs for {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}.

You can view alerts from a specific tool by using the \"Tool\" filter, and the \"Rule\" and \"Tag\" filters will dynamically update based on your \"Tool\" selection.","{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} now includes beta support for analyzing C++20 code. This is only available when building codebases with GCC on Linux. C++20 modules are not supported yet.","The depth of {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}'s analysis has been improved by adding support for more [libraries and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) and increasing the coverage of our existing library and framework models for several languages ([C++](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/cpp), [JavaScript](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/javascript), [Python](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/python), and [Java](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/java)). As a result, {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} can now detect even more potential sources of untrusted user data, review the steps through which that data flows, and identify potentially dangerous sinks in which this data could end up. This results in an overall improvement of the quality of the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-07-01-codeql-code-scanning-now-recognizes-more-sources-and-uses-of-untrusted-user-data/).","{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} now shows `security-severity` levels for CodeQL security alerts. You can configure which `security-severity` levels will cause a check failure for a pull request. The severity level of security alerts can be `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`. By default, any {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with a `security-severity` of `critical` or `high` will cause a pull request check failure. \n\nAdditionally, you can now also configure which severity levels will cause a pull request check to fail for non-security alerts. You can configure this behavior at the repository level, and define whether alerts with the severity `error`, `warning`, or `note` will cause a pull request check to fail. By default, non-security {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with a severity of `error` will cause a pull request check failure.\n\nFor more information see \"[Defining which alert severity levels cause pull request check failure](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure).\"\n\n![List of code scanning alerts with security levels](/assets/images/enterprise/3.2/release-notes/code-scanning-alerts.png)\n","Improvements to the branch filter for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts make it clearer which {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts are being displayed on the alerts page. By default, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts are filtered to show alerts for the default branch of the repository only. You can use the branch filter to display the alerts on any of the non-default branches. Any branch filter that has been applied is shown in the search bar.\n\nThe search syntax has also been simplified to `branch:\u003cbranch name\u003e`. This syntax can be used multiple times in the search bar to filter on multiple branches. The previous syntax, `ref:refs/heads/\u003cbranch name\u003e`, is still supported, so any saved URLs will continue to work.\n","Free text search is now available for code scanning alerts. You can search code scanning results to quickly find specific alerts without having to know exact search terms. The search is applied across the alert's name, description, and help text. The syntax is:\n\n- A single word returns all matches.\n- Multiple search words returns matches to either word.\n- Words in double quotes returns exact matches.\n- The keyword 'AND' returns matches to multiple words.\n","{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} added patterns for 23 new service providers.
