As a result, CodeQL can now detect even more potential sources of untrusted user data, steps through which that data flows, and potentially dangerous sinks where the data could end up. This results in an overall improvement of the quality of code scanning alerts.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>CodeQL now supports scanning standard language features in Java 16, such as records and pattern matching. CodeQL is able to analyze code written in Java version 7 through 16. For more information about supported languages and frameworks, see the <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/#id5">CodeQL documentation</a>.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>Improvements have been made to the code scanning <code>on:push</code> trigger when code is pushed to a pull request. If an <code>on:push</code> scan returns results that are associated with a pull request, code scanning will now show these alerts on the pull request.</p>
<p>Some other CI/CD systems can be exclusively configured to trigger a pipeline when code is pushed to a branch, or even exclusively for every commit. Whenever such an analysis pipeline is triggered and results are uploaded to the SARIF API, code scanning will also try to match the analysis results to an open pull request. If an open pull request is found, the results will be published as described above. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-27-showing-code-scanning-alerts-on-pull-requests/">GitHub changelog</a>.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>You can now use the new pull request filter on the code scanning alerts page to find all the code scanning alerts associated with a pull request. A new "View all branch alerts" link on the pull request "Checks" tab allows you to directly view code scanning alerts with the specific pull request filter already applied. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-23-pull-request-filter-for-code-scanning-alerts/">GitHub changelog</a>.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>User defined patterns for secret scanning is out of beta and is now generally available for GitHub Advanced Security customers. Also new in this release is the ability to edit custom patterns defined at the repository, organization, and enterprise levels. After editing and saving a pattern, secret scanning searches for matches both in a repository's entire Git history and in any new commits. Editing a pattern will close alerts previously associated with the pattern if they no longer match the updated version. Other improvements, such as dry-runs, are planned in future releases.

The REST API now provides beta <code>GET</code>/<code>POST</code>/<code>DELETE</code> endpoints which you can use to view, add, or delete custom autolinks associated with a repository. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/repos#autolinks">Autolinks</a>."</p></li><li class="f4"><p>You can now use the REST API to sync a forked repository with its upstream repository.

For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/repos#git-lfs">Repositories</a>."</p></li><li class="f4"><p>You can now use the REST API to query the audit log for an enterprise. While audit log forwarding provides the ability to retain and analyze data with your own toolkit and determine patterns over time, the new endpoint can help you perform limited analysis on recent events. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/enterprise-admin#get-the-audit-log-for-an-enterprise">GitHub Enterprise administration</a>" in the REST API documentation.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>GitHub App user-to-server API requests can now read public resources using the REST API. This includes, for example, the ability to list a public repository's issues and pull requests, and to access a public repository's comments and content.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>When creating or updating a repository, you can now configure whether forking is allowed using the REST and GraphQL APIs. Previously, APIs for creating and updating repositories didn't include the fields <code>allow_forking</code> (REST) or <code>forkingAllowed</code> (GraphQL). For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/repos">Repositories</a>" in the REST API documentation and "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.3/graphql/reference/objects#repository">Repositories</a>" in the GraphQL API documentation.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>A new GraphQL mutation <a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.3/graphql/reference/mutations#createcommitonbranch"><code>createCommitOnBranch</code></a> makes it easier to add, update, and delete files in a branch of a repository. Compared to the REST API, you do not need to manually create blobs and trees before creating the commit. This allows you to add, update, or delete multiple files in a single API call.</p>

This is useful for verifying your changes are compatible with the current version of the base branch before you merge. Two enhancements now give you more ways to keep your branch up-to-date.\n\n- When your pull request's topic branch is out of date with the base branch, you now have the option to update it by rebasing on the latest version of the base branch. Rebasing applies the changes from your branch onto the latest version of the base branch, resulting in a branch with a linear history since no merge commit is created. To update by rebasing, click the drop down menu next to the **Update Branch** button, click **Update with rebase**, and then click **Rebase branch**. Previously, **Update branch** performed a traditional merge that always resulted in a merge commit in your pull request branch. This option is still available, but now you have the choice. For more information, see \"[Keeping your pull request in sync with the base branch](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/keeping-your-pull-request-in-sync-with-the-base-branch).\"\n\n- A new repository setting allows the **Update branch** button to always be available when a pull request's topic branch is not up to date with the base branch. Previously, this button was only available when the **Require branches to be up to date before merging** branch protection setting was enabled. People with admin or maintainer access can manage the **Always suggest updating pull request branches** setting from the **Pull Requests** section in repository settings.

This change reduces the likelihood of apps being used in phishing attacks against GitHub Enterprise Server users by ensuring integrators are aware of the risks and make a conscious choice to support this form of authentication. If you own or manage an OAuth App or GitHub App and you want to use the device flow, you can enable it for your app via the app's settings page. The device flow API endpoints will respond with status code `400` to apps that have not enabled this feature.

There is a new \"Affected branches\" panel in the sidebar where you can see the status of the alert in other branches. If the alert does not exist in your default branch, the alert page will show the status as \"In branch\" or \"In pull request\" for the location where the alert was last seen. This improvement makes it easier to understand the status of alerts which have been introduced into your code base.

If an alert has more than one analysis origin, it is shown in the \"Affected branches\" sidebar and in the alert timeline. You can hover over the analysis origin icon in the \"Affected branches\" sidebar to see the alert status in each analysis origin. If an alert only has a single analysis origin, no information about analysis origins is displayed on the alert page. These improvements will make it easier to understand your alerts. In particular, it will help you understand those that have multiple analysis origins. This is especially useful for setups with multiple analysis configurations, such as monorepos.
