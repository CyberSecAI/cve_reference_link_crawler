## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Responsive video embed < 0.5.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, create a post with the following shortcode: [rve src='" onload=alert(/XSS/) " ']
The XSS will be triggered when any user will (pre)view the post
