# Buffer Overflow in the yylex() function (READ of size 4)

Hi,

While fuzzing dpic [68ab9432](/aplevich/dpic/-/commit/68ab94321d9ea978b68906d16a315efab4758353 "Colored svg sprintf text and appended %") with Hongfuzz, I found a Buffer Overflow in the yylex() function, in main.c.

Attaching a reproducer, the issue can be reproduced by running:[test01](/-/project/5973503/uploads/48bcfc1b1114e168c06fe281ed7a7d3a/test01)

`dpic test01`

```
