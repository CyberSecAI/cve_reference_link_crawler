A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

When a specific command is executed, the pfe crashes. This will cause traffic forwarding to be interrupted until the system self-recovers. Repeated execution will create a sustained DoS condition.

 This issue only affects MX Series devices with Line cards MPC1-MPC9.
