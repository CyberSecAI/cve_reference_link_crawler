Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when exporting to PDF in Typora version 0.9.65. Specifically, the application failed to prevent the execution of JavaScript code embedded within the exported content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the application's failure to sanitize user input before exporting it to PDF, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage**: Attackers could potentially exfiltrate sensitive information from the user's system. In the provided example, the attacker uses `XMLHttpRequest` to attempt reading a local file (`file:///C:/Windows/system32/inetsrv/MetaBase.xml` on Windows and `/etc/passwd` on Linux) and displaying its content.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Although not directly demonstrated, an XSS vulnerability like this could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user if the PDF viewer itself is vulnerable or if the attacker can leverage the XSS to gain further control.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through crafting a malicious markdown file containing JavaScript code. When this file is exported to PDF, the embedded script is executed by the PDF viewer due to lack of sanitation within the Typora application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify markdown files that will be opened with Typora.
- The attacker requires the targeted user to use Typora version 0.9.65 and to export the manipulated markdown file to PDF.
