##### Notes

Description

---

A hard-coded password in the FileCatalyst TransferAgent can be found which can be used to unlock the keystore from which contents may be read out, for example, the private key for certificates. Exploit of this vulnerability could lead to a machine-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack against users of the agent. This issue affects all versions of FileCatalyst Direct from 3.8.10 Build 138 and earlier and all versions of FileCatalyst Workflow from 5.1.6 Build 130 and earlier.

CVE

CVE-2024-5275

CWE

CWE-259:Use of Hard-coded Password

Discovery Date

13-May-2024

CSSv3.1

7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Affected Products

FileCatalyst Direct 3.8.10 Build 138 TransferAgent (and Earlier)

##### Vulnerability Notes

Remediation: Vendor Fix

---

For FileCatalyst Direct users, upgrade to 3.8.10 build 144 (or higher)
