Executive Summary
Security is an important part of the success of your business. Emerson maintains dedicated security staff
to continuously monitor and analyze potential security issues. We also engage third party experts to help
us design and maintain robust security features within our products. We are committed to reviewing
threats as they become known, issuing notifications when necessary, and providing mitigations and
solutions in a timely manner.

Emerson has been informed of vulnerabilities recently disclosed by an external researcher and verified by
internal testing. The four vulnerabilities allow for an unauthenticated user with network access to run
arbitrary commands in root context, to bypass authentication and acquire admin capabilities, get access
to sensitive information, and run arbitrary commands. Additional information regarding these
vulnerabilities can be found in CISA’s ICS Advisory: ICSA-24-030-01.

This notification is intended to inform end users that Emerson is aware of the vulnerability and has
updated software to address the issue. Emerson does not recommend connecting the Affected Products
directly to the Internet. It is important to note that if the Affected Product is isolated from the internet
as recommended and running on a well-protected network consistent with industry best
practices, the potential risk is lowered. Each user should consider their particular system configuration
and circumstances and determine the effect of this potential issue as it relates to their application and
take appropriate actions.

Risk Assessment
The vulnerability was initially discovered by Vera Mens of Claroty Research and is being disclosed as part
of Emerson’s commitment to our responsible disclosure to inform customers of known potential risks. The
potential risks related to the vulnerabilities discussed in this Cyber Security Notification are lowered if the
Affected Product is isolated from the internet and operating on a well-protected network consistent with
industry practice.
There is four CVE’s associated with this notification:

•  CVE-2023-46687 Preauth Command Injection via Command 0x23 (gunzip)
