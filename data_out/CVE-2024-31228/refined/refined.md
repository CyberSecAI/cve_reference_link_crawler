Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-31228.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unbounded recursion in the `stringmatchlen_impl` function, which is used for glob-style pattern matching within Redis. Specially crafted, long string match patterns can cause excessive recursion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded recursion in the `stringmatchlen_impl` function during pattern matching.
- Inefficient handling of nested wildcard characters, leading to excessive stack usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) via stack overflow, causing the Redis process to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated users can trigger the vulnerability.
- Exploitable through commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST`, and ACL definitions which use pattern matching.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Redis server.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute commands that utilize the vulnerable pattern matching functionality.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue affects all versions of Redis prior to the patched versions.
- The fix implemented in the provided commit introduces a nesting limit to prevent excessive recursion.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity with a CVSS score of 5.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
- The vulnerability is tracked under CWE-674 (Improper Handling of Recursive Calls)
