Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the BoldGrid Easy SEO plugin handles meta descriptions, specifically the `og:description` tag. The plugin extracts the first 130 characters of a post's content to use as the meta description. This is problematic when used with password-protected posts because it exposes the beginning of the post's content, which could reveal sensitive information that should be protected by the password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information from password-protected posts via the `og:description` meta tag.
- **Inadequate Content Handling:** The plugin fails to properly handle password-protected content when generating meta descriptions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can potentially gain access to the first 130 characters of a password-protected post. This could reveal sensitive information such as:
    - Passwords or keys
    - Partial content of the post
    - Other confidential details

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through accessing the HTML source of a page that includes a password-protected post. The vulnerable `og:description` meta tag will be present, exposing the initial portion of the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the affected website to view the page source.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the BoldGrid Easy SEO plugin up to and including 1.6.14.
- The fix is included in version 1.6.15.
- The exposed portion of the content is limited to the first 130 characters.
- The Wordfence article states that the vulnerability was discovered by Krzysztof ZajÄ…c from CERT PL.
