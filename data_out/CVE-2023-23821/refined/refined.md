- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Interactive Polish Map plugin for WordPress, versions 1.2 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin doesn't properly sanitize user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts execute when a user visits the site, potentially leading to user compromise or website defacement.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exploited through the injection of malicious scripts. The specific injection point is not detailed, but would likely be through a user-controlled input parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires the ability to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's vulnerable input points. The vulnerability requires administrator privileges to exploit.
