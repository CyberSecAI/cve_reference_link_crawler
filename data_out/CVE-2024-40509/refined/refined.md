Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `serverMFinDev.asmx` function of OpenPetra v.2023.02. Specifically, the `tab` parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the `tab` parameter of the `serverMFinDev.asmx` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage, which is executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can steal cookies from authenticated users. This can lead to session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account and data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL targeting the `serverMFinDev.asmx` endpoint, injecting the XSS payload within the `tab` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker, meaning they do not need to have existing credentials or access to the application.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send the malicious URL.
- **Ability to induce interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the malicious link. In this case, simply hovering the mouse over a menu item will trigger the XSS.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) URL demonstrates how an attacker would inject the XSS payload: `http://target.com/api/serverMFinDev.asmx?bnd=TMFinDevWebServiceSoap&op=TFinDevWebConnector_Dummy&page=op&tab=x" onmouseover=alert(document.cookie) x="`
- The payload `x" onmouseover=alert(document.cookie) x="` will cause the browser to execute the JavaScript code `alert(document.cookie)`, revealing the user's cookies to the attacker when the mouse hovers over the left navigation menu item on the page.
