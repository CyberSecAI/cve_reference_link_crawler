  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()`. The function returns an `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with a file descriptor. Closing this resource closes the underlying file descriptor, which can lead to the premature closing of arbitrary file descriptors.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of raw file descriptors",
        "Premature closing of file descriptors",
        "Lack of proper validation of file descriptors passed to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`",
         "Unprotected access to internal ops.",
        "Missing permission checks on Web Cache API."
      ],
      "impact": "The premature closing of arbitrary file descriptors, particularly standard input (fd 0), can be exploited to bypass permission prompts. An attacker can control the code executed inside the Deno runtime and achieve arbitrary code execution on the host machine without requiring any permissions, thus violating Deno's security model.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious or compromised Deno application can exploit the vulnerability.",
        "Exploiting a race condition between `clear_stdin()` and `stdin_lock.read_line()` in the permission prompt handling.",
        "Using Web Cache API to create and open files with controlled content without any permissions."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the code executed within a Deno runtime and trigger permission prompts. No initial permissions are required as the Web Cache API can be used without file system permissions.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is exploitable through a race condition during permission prompting. By requesting a very long resource name, the attacker can widen the race window between `clear_stdin()` and `stdin_lock.read_line()`, allowing another Worker to close the stdin (fd 0) and re-open it with a controlled resource before the prompt reads from the standard input. The vulnerability is triggered in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` and affects Deno version 1.39.0, and was fixed in 1.39.1.  The vulnerability also exploits the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks."
