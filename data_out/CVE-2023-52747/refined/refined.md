Based on the provided content, all the commits relate to the same fix for a resource leak in the `hfi1` driver. Here's the breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A resource leak occurs in the `user_exp_rcv_setup` function of the `hfi1` driver when the `copy_to_user` operation fails after resources have been allocated. Specifically, if the first `copy_to_user` for `tidcnt` succeeds, but the subsequent one for `length` fails, allocated resources are not properly released or invalidated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Resource Leak:** Failure to release allocated resources in the error path of the `user_exp_rcv_setup` function.
- **Missing Error Handling:** The original code lacked proper handling for errors occurring during the `copy_to_user` operations, specifically when the second `copy_to_user` failed after the first one succeeded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeated triggering of the vulnerable code path could lead to exhaustion of system resources over time, potentially causing denial-of-service or instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **IOCTL Call:** An attacker could trigger the vulnerable code path by making the `user_exp_rcv_setup` IOCTL call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute IOCTL calls on the `hfi1` driver. This typically means having a user account with the necessary permissions to access the device driver.

**Technical Details:**

The original code had the following logic:
```c
  addr = arg + offsetof(struct hfi1_tid_info, tidcnt);
  if (copy_to_user((void __user *)addr, &tinfo.tidcnt, sizeof(tinfo.tidcnt)))
    return -EFAULT;
  addr = arg + offsetof(struct hfi1_tid_info, length);
  if (copy_to_user((void __user *)addr, &tinfo.length, sizeof(tinfo.length)))
    return -EFAULT;
```

The fix introduces a `ret` variable to capture the error status. If either `copy_to_user` fails, it sets `ret` to `-EFAULT`. Additionally, if any of the `copy_to_user` operations fail, `hfi1_user_exp_rcv_invalid(fd, &tinfo)` will be called to clean up allocated resources.

The corrected code now looks like this:
```c
  ret = -EFAULT;
  addr = arg + offsetof(struct hfi1_tid_info, tidcnt);
  if (copy_to_user((void __user *)addr, &tinfo.tidcnt, sizeof(tinfo.tidcnt)))
  {
	  goto err_out;
  }

  ret = 0;
  addr = arg + offsetof(struct hfi1_tid_info, length);
  if (copy_to_user((void __user *)addr, &tinfo.length, sizeof(tinfo.length)))
  {
	  ret = -EFAULT;
	  goto err_out;
  }
  
err_out:
    if(ret)
       hfi1_user_exp_rcv_invalid(fd, &tinfo);
  return ret;
```
This ensures that resources are properly released even if copy\_to\_user for `length` fails after `copy_to_user` for `tidcnt` succeeds.

**Summary:**

The provided content consistently shows a fix for a resource leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `hfi1` driver. The vulnerability arises from insufficient error handling during a sequence of `copy_to_user` calls. The fix introduces proper error checking and resource invalidation, preventing resource leaks.
