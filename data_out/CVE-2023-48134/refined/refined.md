Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the exposure of the Line channel access token within the client-side response of the `nagayama_copabowl` mini-app. This token is intended to be kept secret and used for authenticating requests to the Line messaging API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The channel access token, a critical credential, is directly embedded in the response from `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`, making it easily accessible to anyone inspecting the network traffic or the application's data.
- **Hardcoded Secret:** The token appears to be hardcoded or accessible within the application's code or responses instead of being securely managed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Malicious Broadcast Messages:** An attacker who obtains the channel access token can use it to send arbitrary messages to users of the `nagayama_copabowl` mini-app. This can be used to spread phishing links, malware, or other malicious content.
- **Potential for Account Takeover/Impersonation:** While not explicitly stated, the exposed token may provide more capabilities than just sending messages, depending on the Line API's functionality and permissions associated with the token.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker could intercept the network traffic of the `nagayama_copabowl` mini-app to obtain the channel access token.
- **Client-Side Inspection:** An attacker could inspect the client-side code or response data of the mini-app to obtain the token.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs access to the Line app and to open the `nagayama_copabowl` mini-app to observe the network traffic and extract the exposed token.
- No special privileges or access to the server are required.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerable mini-app is named `nagayama_copabowl`
- The vulnerable version is Line 13.6.1
- The channel access token is found in the response of the request to `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`.
- The channel access token is typically used in the "Authorization" header when sending messages to the Line API (`https://api.line.me/message/v3/notifier/token`).
- The token is intended to be a secret.
