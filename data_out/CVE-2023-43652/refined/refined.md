The content is related to CVE-2023-43652.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The JumpServer API for the KoKo component does not verify the source of requests when validating user private key logins, leading to the generation of a personal authentication token without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of source verification for API requests.
- Reliance on public keys for authentication without proper authorization controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can use a leaked public key and username to authenticate, gaining unauthorized access to a user's information and authorized actions.
- The attacker can generate an API token.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks through the API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs a leaked public key and a corresponding username.
- Ability to send a crafted API request.
