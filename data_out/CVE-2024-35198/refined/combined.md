## Description

Security fix to prevent allowed\_urls file:// Filter Bypass

Despite the error of `Relative path is not allowed in url:`, the targeted MAR file is copied from the source to the model-store folder.

Issue example:

```
jainudai@6cb1339aade6 serve % ls model_store/

This is the release of TorchServe v0.11.0.

## Highlights Include

* GenAI inference optimizations showcasing
  + `torch.compile` with OpenVINO backend for Stable Diffusion
  + Intel IPEX for Llama
* Experimental support for Apple MPS and linux-aarch64
* Security bug fixing

## GenAI

* Upgraded LLama2 examples to Llama3
  + Supported Llama3 in HuggingFace Accelerate Example [#3108](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3108) [@mreso](https://github.com/mreso)
  + Supported Llama3 in chat bot [#3131](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3131) [@mreso](https://github.com/mreso)
  + Supported Llama3 on inf2 Neuronx transformer using continuous batching or micro batching [#3133](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3133) [#3035](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3035) [@lxning](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commits?author=lxning)
* Examples for LoRA and Mistral [#3077](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3077) [@lxning](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commits?author=lxning)
* IPEX LLM serving example with Intel AMX [#3068](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3068) [@bbhattar](https://github.com/bbhattar)
* Integration of Intel Openvino with TorchServe using `torch.compile`. Example showcase of `openvino` `torch.compile` backend with Stable Diffusion [#3116](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3116) [@suryasidd](https://github.com/suryasidd)
* Enabling retrieval of guaranteed sequential order of input sequences with low latency for stateful inference via HTTP extending this previously gRPC-only feature [#3142](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3142) [@lxning](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commits?author=lxning)

## Linux aarch64 Support:

TorchServe adds support for linux-aarch64 and shows an example working on AWS Graviton. This provides users with a new platform alternative for serving models on CPU.

* Supported linux aarch64 with examples SpeechT5 [#3071](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3071) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

## Apple Silicon Support:

* TorchServe now includes support MPS backend on apple silicon [#3048](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3048) [@udaij12](https://github.com/udaij12) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

* Added XGBoost Classifier Example [#3088](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3088) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

## Security

The ability to bypass allowed\_urls using relative paths has been fixed by ensuring preemptive check for relative paths prior to copying the model archive to the model store directory. Also, the default gRPC inference and management addresses are now set to localhost(127.0.0.1) to reduce scope of default access to gRPC endpoints.

* Fixed allowed\_urls filter bypass [#3082](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3082) [@udaij12](https://github.com/udaij12) [@msaroufim](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commits?author=msaroufim)

# TorchServe bypass allowed\_urls configuration

Critical

[namannandan](/namannandan)
published
GHSA-wxcx-gg9c-fwp2
Jul 18, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

0.4.2

## Patched versions

0.11.0

## Description

### Impact

TorchServe's check on allowed\_urls configuration can be by-passed if the URL contains characters such as ".." but it does not prevent the model from being downloaded into the model store. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced without providing a URL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed\_urls security check. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected.

### Patches

This issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the URL without characters such as ".." before downloading: [#3082](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3082).

TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability.

### References

* [#3082](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3082)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
