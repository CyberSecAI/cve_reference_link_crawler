Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-35198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of URLs provided to TorchServe when loading models. Specifically, the `allowed_urls` filter could be bypassed by using relative path components (e.g., `..`) within the URL. Although the system would display an error message about relative paths, the targeted model archive (`.mar` file) would still be copied to the model store folder. Once copied, the model could be loaded without needing the original URL, thus bypassing the `allowed_urls` check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate URL validation:** The `allowed_urls` filter did not properly block relative path components in URLs, allowing an attacker to potentially specify paths outside of the intended scope.
- **Bypassable security check:** Even when the system displayed a "relative path not allowed" error, it still copied the model archive, enabling subsequent loading of the model without URL checks. This effectively bypassed the intended security mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially:
- **Load arbitrary model files:** By exploiting the relative path traversal, an attacker could load model files from locations that should have been restricted by the `allowed_urls` configuration. This could allow execution of malicious code within the context of TorchServe.
- **Compromise system integrity and availability:** The ability to load arbitrary models could lead to various malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, denial of service, or other attacks against the system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **network-based**. An attacker would send a crafted HTTP POST request to the TorchServe management API with a malicious `url` parameter containing relative path components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the TorchServe management API.
- No authentication is required, as the vulnerability existed in how the URL was processed before authentication checks were performed.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server with a crafted url parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in TorchServe version 0.11.0.
- The fix ensures that URLs are validated to not contain relative path components before downloading the model archive.
- The vulnerability is considered **Critical** with a CVSS v3 score of 9.8/10.
- Amazon SageMaker and EKS users utilizing PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) are not affected, as the vulnerability is within the core TorchServe functionality.
- This vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Kroll Cyber Risk.
