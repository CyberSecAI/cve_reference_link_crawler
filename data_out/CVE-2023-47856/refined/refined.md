- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `set_RadvdPrefixParam` function of the Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK. The function copies data from a request parameter into a stack buffer without proper size validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The `strcpy` function is used to copy the value of the `if6to4_<j>` parameter into the `pradvdCfgParam->interface.prefix[j].if6to4` buffer without any bounds check, which is on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer allocated for `pradvdCfgParam`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address and other data on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network requests. A specially crafted HTTP POST request sent to the `/boafrm/formRadvd` API endpoint can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. They also need valid administrative credentials to access the `/boafrm/formRadvd` API.
