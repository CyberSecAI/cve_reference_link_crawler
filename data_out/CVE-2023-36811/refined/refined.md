{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in the cryptographic authentication scheme in Borg allowed an attacker to fake archives.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The cryptographic authentication scheme in Borg did not properly verify the authenticity of archives, allowing an attacker to create spoofed archives.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could fake archives, potentially leading to data loss in the repository. While plaintext disclosure and existing archive authenticity are not affected, the spoofed archives can cause data loss indirectly.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to be able to insert files (without additional headers) into backups and gain write access to the repository.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs write access to the repository and the ability to insert files into backups. The attacker does not need access to the plaintext data."
