In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: elx: libefc: Fix potential use after free in efc_nport_vport_del()

The kref_put() function will call nport->release if the refcount drops to
zero.  The nport->release release function is _efc_nport_free() which frees
"nport".  But then we dereference "nport" on the next line which is a use
after free.  Re-order these lines to avoid the use after free.
