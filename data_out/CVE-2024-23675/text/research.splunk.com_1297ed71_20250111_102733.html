# Detection: Splunk Enterprise KV Store Incorrect Authorization

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 8f0e8380-a835-4f2b-b749-9ce119364df0
Author: Rod Soto, Eric McGinnis, Chase Franklin
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following analytic detects unauthorized attempts to reload Splunk KV Store collections via the REST API. It leverages internal index logs to identify POST requests to the `/servicesNS/nobody/search/admin/collections-conf/_reload` endpoint, focusing on status codes starting with '2'. This activity is significant as it may indicate improper permission handling, potentially leading to unauthorized deletion of KV Store collections. If confirmed malicious, this could result in data loss or unauthorized data manipulation, impacting the integrity and availability of critical Splunk data.

### Search

```
1`splunkda` uri=/servicesNS/nobody/search/admin/collections-conf/_reload status=2* method="POST" user=* file=_reload
2| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(status) as status by host clientip file method
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_enterprise_kv_store_incorrect_authorization_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_enterprise\_kv\_store\_incorrect\_authorization\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_enterprise_kv_store_incorrect_authorization_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes and REST API enabled instances.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and will produce false positives. Operator must follow results into instances where curl requests coming from actual users may indicate intent of exploitation.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible attempt to access KV Store collections at $host$ | 25 | 50 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
