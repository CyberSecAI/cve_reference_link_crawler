### Description

The 简数采集器 (Keydatas) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the keydatas\_downloadImages function in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

Wordfence blocked **740 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.
