Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** Second-order SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The `manageQuantitiesAndProcurement` function in `application/modules/admin/models/Orders_model.php` directly incorporates the values of `$product['product_quantity']` and `$product['product_info']['id']` into SQL queries without any sanitization.
- These values are retrieved from the `orders` table, specifically from the `products` column which stores a serialized array.
- The `setOrder` function in `application/models/Public_model.php` controls the values stored in the `products` column of the `orders` table. User-supplied data is used to generate the serialized array that gets stored in this column. Specifically, the 'quantity' field in the POST request is used as the `product_quantity` value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the data before inserting it into SQL queries. Specifically, the code does not use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
- **Second-Order Injection:** The vulnerability is second-order because the malicious SQL injection is stored in the database first, then later retrieved and executed.
- **Unserialized data:** The `products` column is stored in serialized form, making it difficult to sanitize the data and easily create a malicious payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or potential privilege escalation.
- The provided exploit example demonstrates injecting `<?php phpinfo();?>` into the database. While this particular example causes a SQL syntax error, a more sophisticated attacker could craft a payload to extract sensitive data or manipulate the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user can submit a crafted POST request to the `/Ecommerce-CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/checkout` endpoint, injecting malicious SQL into the `quantity` parameter which will be stored in the `products` column of the `orders` table after serialization.
- The administrator then processes the order through `/Ecommerce-CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/admin/changeOrdersOrderStatus`, which causes the malicious SQL to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit requests to the e-commerce platform, which can be done by simply interacting with the website as a normal customer.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the first-order SQL injection vulnerability since the `setOrder` function is part of the public interface.
- The attacker needs the administrator to process the crafted order to trigger the second-order injection.
