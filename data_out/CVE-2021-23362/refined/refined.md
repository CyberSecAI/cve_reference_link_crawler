  "CVE-2021-23362": {
    "Description": "The package hosted-git-info before 3.0.8 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via regular expression shortcutMatch in the fromUrl function in index.js. The affected regular expression exhibits polynomial worst-case time complexity.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a regular expression (`shortcutMatch`) used in the `fromUrl` function, which exhibits polynomial worst-case time complexity leading to catastrophic backtracking.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)",
      "Catastrophic Backtracking"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing specially crafted input strings that trigger excessive backtracking, leading to high CPU consumption and potentially making the system unavailable to legitimate users.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through providing malicious input strings to the `fromUrl` function of the `hosted-git-info` package. This can be done remotely if the application using this package accepts user-provided URLs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide an input string that will be processed by the vulnerable regular expression. No special privileges or user interaction is needed."
