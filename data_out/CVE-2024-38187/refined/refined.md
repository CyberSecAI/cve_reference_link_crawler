{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds read in the handling of License Update Field Type 0x20 within the CLIPSP.SYS driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability occurs when processing a license blob with a tampered or truncated field of type 0x20. The code reads data from the 'entry_ptr' without verifying if the 'entry_size' is sufficient to accommodate the read operation, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause an access violation, leading to a denial-of-service (blue screen) condition. If the manipulated license file is successfully installed, this can lead to a recurring denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted license blob to the `SPCallServerHandleUpdateLicense` function, which is accessed via the `NtQuerySystemInformation` function with the `SystemPolicyInformation` class.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious license blob and trigger the `NtQuerySystemInformation` function to call the vulnerable code path. No specific user privileges are mentioned as being required."
