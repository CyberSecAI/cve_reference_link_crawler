- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Transition Slider plugin, in versions 2.20.3 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack allows a malicious actor to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website, which will be executed when visitors access the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's unsanitized input handling which can be exploited by a malicious user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an editor to exploit the vulnerability.
