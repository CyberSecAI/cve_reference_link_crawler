# Serv-U Remote Memory Escape Vulnerability

## (CVE-2021-35211)

**Security Vulnerability**

Released: July 9, 2021

Last updated: July 15, 2021

Assigning CNA: SolarWinds

### Security Advisory Summary

**UPDATE July 15, 20201:** **You can** [Subscribe to this RSS Feed](https://www.solarwinds.com/shared-content/rss-feed/solarwinds-cve-rss-feed) **to be notified when we update this page (note: you will need to cut and paste the "Subscribe to this RSS feed" URL into an RSS Feed Reader, e.g., Outlook's RSS Subscriptions, to monitor updates).**

**UPDATE July 13, 20201:** **We've provided additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) below. You can also find additional details on the threat actor and their findings in a** [blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/07/13/microsoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit/) **from Microsoft.**

**UPDATE July 10, 2021:** **NOTE: This security vulnerability** **only** **affects Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP and** **does not affect** **any other SolarWinds or N-able (formerly SolarWinds MSP) products.**

SolarWinds was recently notified by Microsoft of a security vulnerability related to [Serv-U Managed File Transfer Server](https://www.solarwinds.com/serv-u-managed-file-transfer-server) and [Serv-U Secured FTP](https://www.solarwinds.com/ftp-server-software) and have developed a hotfix to resolve this vulnerability. While Microsoft’s research indicates this vulnerability exploit involves a limited, targeted set of customers and a single threat actor, our joint teams have mobilized to address it quickly.

The vulnerability exists in the latest Serv-U version 15.2.3 HF1 released May 5, 2021, and all prior versions. A threat actor who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or run programs on the affected system.

Serv-U version 15.2.3 hotfix (HF) 2 has been released. Please see the **Security Updates** table below for the applicable update for your system. We recommend you install these updates immediately. If you are unable to install these updates, see the **FAQ** in this Security Advisory for information on how to help protect your system from this vulnerability.

Additional details of the vulnerability will be published after giving customers sufficient time to upgrade for the protection of their environments.

### Affected Products

### **FAQ**

#### **What happened?**

Microsoft reported to SolarWinds that they had discovered a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the SolarWinds Serv-U product. Microsoft provided a proof of concept of the exploit. If exploited, a threat actor may be able to gain privileged access to the threat actor on the machine hosting Serv-U.

To the best of our understanding, no other SolarWinds products have been affected by this vulnerability.

#### **Have SolarWinds customers been affected?**

Microsoft has provided evidence of limited, targeted customer impact, though SolarWinds does not currently have an estimate of how many customers may be directly affected by the vulnerability. SolarWinds is unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers.

#### **Have N-able customers been affected?**

No, N-able customer who do not use Serv-U are not affected by this vulnerability.

*Updated July 13, 2021*

#### **What products are affected?**

**Only** SolarWinds Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP **for Windows** are affected by this vulnerability. Please note the Serv-U Gateway is a component of these two products and is not a separate product.

The Linux versions of these products **are not vulnerable** to a RCE exploit of this security vulnerability. The Linux version of the Serv-U product crashes when the exploit is attempted by a threat actor.

*Updated July 15, 2021*

*Updated July 10, 2021*

#### **What actions should I take?**

If you are an **active maintenance SolarWinds customer of the Serv-U product**, SolarWinds asks you to log into your [Customer Portal](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/) to access your updates. This update is expected to take only a few minutes to implement.

If you are **not on active maintenance and currently using a Serv-U product**, our Customer Success team is available to help you with your questions. Please open a [customer service ticket](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/support/submit-a-ticket?sid=satsn) with the subject "Serv-U Assistance" and our team will assist you (no login required).

*Updated July 13, 2021*

#### **How can I tell if my environment has been compromised?**

The following steps are steps you can take to determine if your environment has been compromised:

**1. Is SSH enabled for your Serv-U installation?** If SSH is not enabled in the environment, the vulnerability does not exist.

**2. Is your environment throwing exceptions?** This attack is a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) attack. When exploited, the vulnerability causes the Serv-U product to throw an exception and then intercepts the exception handling code to run commands. Please note, several reasons exist for exceptions to be thrown, so an exception itself is not necessarily an indicator of attack.

Please collect the **DebugSocketlog.txt** log file, which can be found in the following locations:

C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\DebugSocketlog.txt

C:\ProgramFiles\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\DebugSocketlog.txt

In the log file **DebugSocketlog.txt** you may see an exception, such as:

07] Tue 01Jun21 02:42:58 - EXCEPTION: C0000005; CSUSSHSocket::ProcessReceive(); Type: 30; puchPayLoad = 0x041ec066; nPacketLength = 76; nBytesReceived = 80;

nBytesUncompressed = 156; uchPaddingLength = 5

Exceptions may be thrown for other reasons so **please collect the logs** to assist with determining your situation.

**3. Are you seeing potentially suspicious connections via SSH?** Look for connections via SSH from the following IP addresses, which have been reported as a potential indicator of attack by the threat actor:

**98[.]176[.]196[.]89**

**68[.]235[.]178[.]32**

**208[.]113[.]35[.]58**

**144[.]34[.]179[.]162**

**97[.]77[.]97[.]58**

Other indicators:

**hxxp://144[.]34[.]179[.]162/a**

**C:\Windows\Temp\Serv-u.bat**

**C:\Windows\Temp\test\current.dmp**

**4. Are you seeing potentially suspicious activity by Serv-U?** Review your monitoring tools and/or EDR platforms for Serv-U.exe spawning anomalous processes, such as:

* *mshta.exe*
* *powershell.exe*
* *cmd.exe* (or *conhost.exe* then spawning *cmd.exe*) with any of the following in the command line:

+ *whoami*
+ *dir*
+ *./Client/Common*
+ *.\Client\Common*
+ *type [a file path] > "C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users\[file name].Archive"*

* Any process with the following in the command line:

+ *C:\Windows\Temp\*

* The addition of any unrecognized Global users to Serv-U. This can be checked in the users tab of the Serv-U Management Console, as shown below. It can also be checked by looking for recently created files in *C:\ProgramData\RhinoSoft\Serv-U\Users\Global Users*, which appears to store the Global users information.

If you observe this activity, investigate these processes further, and any traffic originating from the Serv-U box. Please contact SolarWinds Customer Support with this information, and we will escalate for investigation.

#### **Is this vulnerability related to the SUNBURST cyberattack?**

No. It’s important to note this new vulnerability is completely unrelated to the SUNBURST supply chain attack. Software vulnerabilities are quite common, range in severity levels, and are routinely resolved by software vendors as part of their ongoing maintenance release schedules.

#### **What kind of vulnerability is this?**

Based on our investigations, this is a remote code execution (RCE) exploit.

#### **What versions of Serv-U are affected?**

Based on our investigations, this RCE exploit affects all versions of Serv-U, prior to version 15.2.3 HF2, which has been built to address this vulnerability, and to help protect your environment.

*Updated July 13, 2021*

#### **Where can I get additional information?**

We understand the desire for more information on this issue, and we’ll provide more information here as it’s available.

In the meantime, our Customer Success team is available to you. Please open a [customer service ticket](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/support/submit-a-ticket?sid=satsn) with the subject "Serv-U Assistance" and our team will assist you (no login required).
