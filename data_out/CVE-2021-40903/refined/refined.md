```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a static secret key ('super secret key') for signing session cookies instead of generating a unique, random key. This static key is present in the application's `settings.py` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass due to the use of a static, hardcoded secret key for session cookie signing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can craft a valid session cookie using the static key, allowing them to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting a malicious session cookie.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to craft a session cookie using the known secret key. This can be done using tools like `flask-unsign`."
