Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper handling of the `$mr_id` parameter in the `pda/meeting/apply.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `$mr_id` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive database information, modify data, or even compromise the entire database server. This is achieved by injecting SQL code that allows for data retrieval, modification, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to the `pda/meeting/apply.php` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `mr_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application server.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the `mr_id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided examples demonstrate how to use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract database information:
    - `GET /pda/meeting/apply.php?mr_id=1%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),1,1))=char(116)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B) HTTP/1.1`
    - The attacker is using `substr(DATABASE(),1,1)` to extract the first character of the database name.
    - Subsequent requests extract other characters of database name.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- Tongda OA v2017 - v11.9

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub issue contains details about the vulnerable parameter and example payloads.
- The attacker can leverage the SQL injection to obtain database name and potentially perform further attacks to steal or modify data.
