{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of root.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted XML data to the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability."
