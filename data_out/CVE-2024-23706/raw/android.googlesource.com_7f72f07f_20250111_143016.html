            Throw exception when trying to instantiate a change log token with norecord types.Note that this does mean that any developers that were previouslyrequesting change logs without specifying record types will no longer beable to. However, the APK doesn't allow this anyway, so it is likely ok.Test: atest CtsHealthFitnessDeviceTestCases:HealthConnectChangeLogsTests#testGetChangeLogToken_emptyRecordTypes_throwsExceptionBug: 327332482(cherry picked from commit cd228a3e21c9c8df83bc3851736d6f4e19956e46)(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:c47251b82509773719b4b797d508b03216ab0e71)Merged-In: I5dd49131fbe5eaa8bc138be03550f7fc739786d9Change-Id: I5dd49131fbe5eaa8bc138be03550f7fc739786d9
