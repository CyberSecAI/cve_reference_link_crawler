Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of alternative XSS syntax within the `body` field of Bolt CMS 3.7.1. Specifically, the system fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied input in a way that prevents the execution of malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `body` field. When a user previews or views the affected content, this script will execute within their browser context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies and gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data, such as personal information or other user data.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating downloads of malware.
    *   **Other malicious actions** that can be performed by JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/preview/page` endpoint with the malicious payload in the `body` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Bolt CMS.
*   **Access to Content Editing:** The attacker must have the ability to edit content, specifically, the `body` field of a page.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Syntax:** The attacker should know how to craft an XSS payload using alternative syntax that bypasses sanitization. The provided proof-of-concept uses an `img` tag with an `onerror` handler.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/preview/page`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `body`
*   **PoC Payload:** `%3Cimg+src%3D1+href%3D1+onerror%3D%22javascript%3Aalert%281%29%22%3E%3C%2Fimg%3E` which translates to `<img src=1 href=1 onerror="javascript:alert(1)"></img>`

**Additional Notes**
* The report indicates that the vulnerability is present in Bolt CMS version 3.7.1.
* The PoC demonstrates that the vulnerability can be exploited by submitting a crafted POST request.
