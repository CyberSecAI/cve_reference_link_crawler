Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-26879**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is missing clocks in the `axg_clk_regmaps` array within the Linux kernel's clock driver for Meson SoCs. This oversight causes a null pointer dereference when accessing the clock information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The vulnerability is a direct result of a missing clock entry in the `axg_clk_regmaps` array. When the kernel attempts to access the missing clock via a pointer, it results in dereferencing a NULL pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic:** The immediate impact is a kernel panic, which crashes the system. This is triggered when the system attempts to read clock information, specifically via `/sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary`.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Accessing debugfs clock information:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user tries to read `/sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary`. This suggests an attack could be launched from the local system by any user with read access to the debugfs file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  **Local access:** An attacker needs local access to the system and should be able to read from debugfs file system to trigger the vulnerability. No other privileges or special capabilities are mentioned.

**Technical Details:**
- The missing clock entries are: `axg_vclk_div1`, `axg_vclk2_div`, and `axg_vclk2_div1`.
- The kernel panic occurs within `regmap_read` when called from `clk_regmap_gate_is_enabled`.
- The fix consists of adding the missing clocks to the `axg_clk_regmaps` array.
