Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of path validation in the Report Info Plugin when serving report files. Specifically, the plugin does not validate the workspace directory, which leads to a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin fails to sanitize or validate the provided workspace path, allowing attackers to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin is not performing necessary checks on user-supplied input, specifically the workspace path, making it susceptible to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the Jenkins controller file system, including Surefire failures, PMD violations, Findbugs bugs, and Checkstyle errors. This information can reveal insights into the project build process and potentially expose sensitive information.
*   **Unintended Access:** The vulnerability allows attackers with sufficient privileges to bypass intended access controls and retrieve data that they are not authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulating Workspace Path:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by modifying the workspace path within the Report Info Plugin's configuration, using path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Item/Configure Permission:** The attacker needs to have "Item/Configure" permission to modify job configurations and specify the manipulated workspace path.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Report Info plugin also does not support distributed builds.
*   There is no fix available for this vulnerability at the time of the advisory's publication.
