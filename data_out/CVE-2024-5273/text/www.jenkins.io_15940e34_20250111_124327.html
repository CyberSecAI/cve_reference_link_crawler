## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Team Concert Git Plugin

**SECURITY-3250
/
CVE-2024-28793**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`teamconcert-git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/teamconcert-git)**

**Description:**

Team Concert Git Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier does not escape the Rational Team Concert (RTC) server URI on the build page when showing changes.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs.

Team Concert Git Plugin 2.0.5 escapes the Rational Team Concert (RTC) server URI on the build page when showing changes.

### XXE vulnerabilities in OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin

**SECURITY-3278
/
CVE-2024-4189 (LrScriptResultsParser.java), CVE-2024-4184 (XpathReader.java), CVE-2024-4690 (others)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`hp-application-automation-tools-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/hp-application-automation-tools-plugin)**

**Description:**

OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parsers to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin build steps and post-build steps to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.1-beta disables external entity resolution for its XML parsers.

|  | The fix is currently available only as a beta release. Beta releases will not appear in the regular update center but can be found in the experimental update center. For more information on how to install a beta release, see this [documentation](/doc/developer/publishing/releasing-experimental-updates/#using-the-experimental-update-center). |

### Missing permission checks in OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin

**SECURITY-3277
/
CVE-2024-4211 (ALM jobs configurations), CVE-2024-4691 (ALM Octane configurations), CVE-2024-4692 (Service Virtualization configurations)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`hp-application-automation-tools-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/hp-application-automation-tools-plugin)**

**Description:**

OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate ALM jobs configurations, ALM Octane configurations and Service Virtualization configurations.

OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin 24.1.1-beta requires Item/Configure permission to enumerate ALM jobs configurations, ALM Octane configurations and Service Virtualization configurations.

|  | The fix is currently available only as a beta release. Beta releases will not appear in the regular update center but can be found in the experimental update center. For more information on how to install a beta release, see this [documentation](/doc/developer/publishing/releasing-experimental-updates/#using-the-experimental-update-center). |

### Path traversal vulnerability in Report Info Plugin

**SECURITY-3070
/
CVE-2024-5273**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`report-info`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/report-info)**

**Description:**

Report Info Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not perform path validation of the workspace directory while serving report files.

Additionally, Report Info Plugin does not support distributed builds.

This results in a path traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permission to retrieve Surefire failures, PMD violations, Findbugs bugs, and Checkstyle errors on the controller file system by editing the workspace path.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
