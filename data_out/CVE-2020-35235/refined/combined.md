I needed to access quickly to my cpanel. But somehow I lost my cpanel creds. I was looking for some other workaround, something like this plugin. It was so easy and handy to access to the root. Such an awesome plugin you made and probably the best file manager plugin available in the wp plugin. Great job üôÇ

# Authenticated RCE vulnerability in WordPress Secure File Manager plugin (unpatched).

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [November 23, 2020 - 11:10am [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:21pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/authenticated-rce-vulnerability-in-wordpress-secure-file-manager-plugin-unpatched/)

> This plugin is not maintained any longer and the vulnerability has never been fixed. Make sure to follow the recommendations below.

The WordPress [Secure File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/secure-file-manager/) plugin (¬±1,000 active installations) is prone to an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting version 2.5 and below.

### Authenticated Remote Code Execution

The plugin uses the same elFinder libraries as the [File Manager](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-zero-day-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-file-manager-700000-installations/) plugin we mentioned last September.

In the ‚Äúvendor/elfinder/php/connector.minimal.php‚Äù script, it loads elFinder:

```
if ( wp_validate_auth_cookie() ){
   runConnector();
}

```

The file manager communicates directly with the script using AJAX. There‚Äôs no capability check or security nonce, the only restriction being a call to the WordPress `wp_validate_auth_cookie` function L328, which checks if the user is authenticated or not.

Any logged-in user can run the file manager‚Äôs commands (e.g. upload, rename, create, view, delete etc). The command can be executed in any directory inside the vhost.

### Timeline

Due to unsuccessful attempts to contact the author on September 02, 2020, the issue was escalated to the wordpress.org plugins team and the plugin was removed from the repo on September 08.

### Recommendations

**We recommend to uninstall this plugin as there isn‚Äôt any security patch available.** If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.
