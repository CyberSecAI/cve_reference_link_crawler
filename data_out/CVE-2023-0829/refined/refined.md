Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in Plesk versions 17.0 up to 18.0.31. The vulnerability exists because of improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). Malicious input is not properly sanitized, allowing a malicious user to inject scripts into web pages.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A malicious subscription owner (either a customer or an additional user) can fully compromise the Plesk server.
    *   This compromise occurs if an administrator visits a specific page in Plesk related to the malicious subscription.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
    *   The attack is of low complexity (AC:L).
    *   The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L), as a subscription owner can perform the attack.
    *   The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a subscription owner (customer or additional user) within the Plesk system.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through their subscription to target an admin.

The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, by specifying that the XSS is stored and that the attacker can fully compromise the server, given an administrator visits a page related to the malicious subscription.
