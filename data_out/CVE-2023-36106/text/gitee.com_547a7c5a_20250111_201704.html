[PowerJob](https://github.com/PowerJob/PowerJob) is an open-source distributed computing and job scheduling framework which allows developers to easily schedule tasks in their own application.
Refer to [PowerJob Introduction](https://www.yuque.com/powerjob/en/introduce) for detailed information.
# Introduction
### Features
- \*\*Friendly UI:\*\* [Front-end](http://try.powerjob.tech/#/welcome?appName=powerjob-agent-test&password=123) page is provided and developers can manage their task, monitor the status, check the logs online, etc.
- \*\*Abundant Timing Strategies:\*\* Four timing strategies are supported, including CRON expression, fixed rate, fixed delay and OpenAPI which allows you to define your own scheduling policies, such as delaying execution.
- \*\*Multiple Execution Mode:\*\* Four execution modes are supported, including stand-alone, broadcast, Map and MapReduce. Distributed computing resource could be utilized in MapReduce mode, try the magic out [here](https://www.yuque.com/powerjob/en/za1d96#9YOnV)!
- \*\*Workflow(DAG) Support:\*\* Both job dependency management and data communications between jobs are supported.
- \*\*Extensive Processor Support:\*\* Developers can write their processors in Java, Shell, Python, and will subsequently support multilingual scheduling via HTTP.
- \*\*Powerful Disaster Tolerance:\*\* As long as there are enough computing nodes, configurable retry policies make it possible for your task to be executed and finished successfully.
- \*\*High Availability & High Performance:\*\* PowerJob supports unlimited horizontal expansion. It's easy to achieve high availability and performance by deploying as many PowerJob server and worker nodes.
### Applicable scenes
- Timed tasks, for example, allocating e-coupons on 9 AM every morning.
- Broadcast tasks, for example, broadcasting to the cluster to clear logs.
- MapReduce tasks, for example, speeding up certain job like updating large amounts of data.
- Delayed tasks, for example, processing overdue orders.
- Customized tasks, triggered with [OpenAPI](https://www.yuque.com/powerjob/en/openapi).
### Online trial
- Address: [try.powerjob.tech](http://try.powerjob.tech/#/welcome?appName=powerjob-agent-test&password=123)

[PowerJob-V4.3.8](/KFCFans/PowerJob/releases/tag/v4.3.8)

####

#### The Open Source Evaluation Index is derived from the OSS Compass evaluation system, which evaluates projects around the following three dimensions

1. Open source ecosystem

* Productivity: To evaluate the ability of open-source projects to output software artifacts and open-source value.
* Innovation: Used to evaluate the degree of diversity of open source software and its ecosystem.
* Robustness: Used to evaluate the ability of open-source projects to resist internal and external interference and self recover in the face of changing development environments.

2. Collaboration, People, Software

* Collaboration: represents the degree and depth of collaboration in open source development behavior.
* Observe the influence of core personnel in open source projects, and examine the evaluations of users and developers on open source projects from a third-party perspective.
* Software: Evaluate the value of products exported from open-source projects and their ultimate destination. It is also a concrete manifestation of "open source software", one of the oldest mainstream directions in open source evaluation.

3. Evaluation model

Based on the dimensions of "open source ecosystem" and "collaboration, people, and software", identify quantifiable indicators directly or indirectly related to this goal, quantitatively evaluate the health and ecology of open source projects, and ultimately form an open source evaluation index.
