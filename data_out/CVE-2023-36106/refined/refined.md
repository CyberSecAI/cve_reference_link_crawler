Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-36106

**Product:** PowerJob

**Affected Version:** PowerJob <= 4.3.2

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from "Incorrect Access Control" on interfaces related to container information queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsecured access control mechanisms on interfaces that handle container information.
- This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information leakage due to the ability to query container information without proper authorization. The content suggests the existence of "interfaces related to container information query," implying details about containers, which could include configuration details or application data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers exploit the vulnerable interfaces related to container information queries.
- The exact method of exploitation (e.g., specific API endpoint) is not detailed in the description but is implied that the interfaces are accessible without proper authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be in a position to access the vulnerable PowerJob interfaces, likely through the network (e.g., by being on the same network or by accessing the application via an exposed service).
- It is implied that no prior authentication or authorization is required, or the authorization mechanisms are easily bypassed or non-existent on the exploited interfaces.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of PowerJob up to and including 4.3.2.
- The github gist mentions "sensitive information leakage" which indicates a confidentiality breach.
