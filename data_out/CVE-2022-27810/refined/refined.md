- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An infinite recursion condition in the error handler of the Hermes JavaScript engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The error handler in Hermes can be triggered into an infinite recursion loop when processing specific, maliciously crafted JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The infinite recursion can potentially cause a denial-of-service condition due to excessive resource consumption.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires the execution of a specifically crafted malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code processed by a vulnerable version of the Hermes engine (prior to v0.12.0). It is noted that this is only exploitable in dev mode (when asserts are enabled).
