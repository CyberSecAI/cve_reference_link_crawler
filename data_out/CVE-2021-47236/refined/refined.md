- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `eem_tx_fixup` function in the `cdc_eem.c` driver does not free the original skb if `skb_copy_expand` fails, leading to a memory leak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak in the `eem_tx_fixup` function when `skb_copy_expand` fails.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Repeated triggering of the vulnerable code path can lead to a memory exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending network traffic through the cdc_eem interface that would require the skb to be fixed up. Specifically, the `skb_copy_expand` function needs to fail in order for the leak to occur.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic via a cdc_eem interface.
