- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SINEMA Remote Connect Server contains a file upload service that is vulnerable to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input during file uploads, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a malicious file through the vulnerable file upload service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileged access to the application to exploit this vulnerability.
