Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input passed to the `mepr-user-file` shortcode, which allows an attacker to inject a URL and make the server perform a request to that URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes a request to an attacker-controlled URL without sanitizing or validating it, leading to a blind SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can query internal services, potentially revealing sensitive data not intended for public access.
- **Modification of Internal Services:** The vulnerability could be leveraged to modify information on internal services, depending on the service's API or accessibility.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting a malicious URL into the `mepr-user-file` shortcode.
- **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based, involving the injection of a crafted URL through the shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor Access or Higher:** Attackers need to have at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site to be able to create content and use the vulnerable shortcode.
