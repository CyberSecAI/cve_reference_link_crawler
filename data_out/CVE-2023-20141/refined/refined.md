- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the affected device and then persuade a user of the management interface to visit a specific page containing malicious payloads. The attacker is considered remote and unauthenticated.
