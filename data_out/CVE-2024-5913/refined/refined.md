- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of input, which allows an attacker with physical access to tamper with the file system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical, requiring the attacker to have direct access to the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device's file system and must have high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
