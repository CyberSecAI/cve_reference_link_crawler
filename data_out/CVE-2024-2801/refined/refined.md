Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Shopkeeper Extender plugin for WordPress versions 3.6 and earlier is vulnerable due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the `image_slide` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page, potentially leading to:
    *   Account hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's `image_slide` shortcode. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through attributes of the shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.7 of the plugin
* The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci
