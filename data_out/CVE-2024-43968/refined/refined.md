Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue, which means there's a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Newspack WordPress plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to properly restrict access to certain plugin functionalities based on user roles or permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is described as low severity.
- An unprivileged user (e.g., a subscriber) could potentially execute actions that are intended for more privileged users, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or information disclosure, although this is not detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of access controls within the Newspack plugin.
- A user with subscriber privileges can attempt to execute actions meant for higher-privileged roles.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to have at least "Subscriber" level privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable versions are those prior to 3.8.7.
- The fixed version is 3.8.7.
- A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
- The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.
- The CVSS score is 4.3, which is considered low.
