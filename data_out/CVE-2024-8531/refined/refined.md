- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper verification of cryptographic signature during upgrade bundle processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software fails to properly verify the cryptographic signature of upgrade bundles, allowing manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate an upgrade bundle to include arbitrary bash scripts, which are then executed as root, leading to potential compromise of the Data Center Expert software and access to private data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the manipulation of the upgrade bundle.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to manipulate the upgrade bundle, which may require high privileges.
