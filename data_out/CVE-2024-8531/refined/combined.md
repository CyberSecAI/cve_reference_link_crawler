Remediation

Affected Product & Version

Remediation

EcoStruxure™ IT Data Center Expert
Versions 8.1.1.3 and earlier

(Formerly known as StruxureWare
Data Center Expert)

Version  8.2  of  EcoStruxure™  IT  Data  Center  Expert
includes fixes for these vulnerabilities and is available
upon request from Schneider Electric’s
Customer Care Center.

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to
their systems. We strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these
patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact
Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

Mitigations

•  Ensure that the principals of least privilege are being followed so that only those with need
have account access and that the level of their respective account authorization aligns
with their role, including Privileged Accounts as described in the Data Center Expert
Security Handbook.

•  Verify SHA1 checksums of upgrade bundles prior to executing upgrades as described in

the Upgrades section of the Data Center Expert Security Handbook..

•  Delete any existing “logcapture” archives present on the system and do not create any

new “logcapture” archives. Existing archives can be deleted from the
https://server_ip/capturelogs web page after authenticating.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
