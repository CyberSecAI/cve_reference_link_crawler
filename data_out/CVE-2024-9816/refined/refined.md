Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the uploaded file within the `/admin/change-image.php` file of the Codezips Tourist Management System. The application directly uses the `$_FILES` variable to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without any verification or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files due to the missing input validation and cleaning mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts), attackers can achieve RCE.
*  **File Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite existing files.
*   **File Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious code into existing files.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Attackers might be able to navigate the file system and access sensitive files.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By uploading large files or a large number of files, attackers can cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a multipart/form-data payload to the `/admin/change-image.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided information doesn't indicate any authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The provided proof-of-concept does not show any authentication headers or cookies.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code snippet is located around line 80 of the `/admin/change-image.php` file where the `$_FILES` variable is used directly to save uploaded files.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates uploading a PHP file containing `<?php system('ipconfig'); ?>` which resulted in successful execution of the script on the server.
