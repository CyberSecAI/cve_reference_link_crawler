- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Information Server allowed lower-level authenticated users to view the list of other users and groups.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, where lower-level authenticated users are able to view information about higher-level users and groups.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability allows lower-level authenticated users to gain visibility of higher-level users and groups. This could potentially be used for reconnaissance and could lead to further attacks. The access granted was limited to "VIEW access only".
- **Attack vectors**: A lower-level authenticated user can access a view of higher-level users and groups via the application interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid low-level user credentials to access the system.
