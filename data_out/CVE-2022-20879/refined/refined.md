- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Buffer Overflow (CWE-120)
  - OS Command Injection (CWE-77)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Remote code execution with root-level privileges.
  - Denial of service (DoS) by causing the device to restart unexpectedly.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device. The web-based management interface is accessible via LAN, and potentially WAN if remote management is enabled.
