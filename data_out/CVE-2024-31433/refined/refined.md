- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress versions 6.3.0 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to execute actions with the privileges of a logged-in user. The specific impact varies depending on the context but may include unauthorized modifications, data breaches, or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request that is triggered by a user with an active session on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site but needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering the malicious request.
