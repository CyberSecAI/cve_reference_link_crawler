**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-43684

**Vulnerability Description:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Microchip TimeProvider® 4100 Grandmaster.

**Root Cause:** The web front-end of the TimeProvider® 4100 Grandmaster does not implement anti-CSRF tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Lack of CSRF protection: The application doesn't use anti-CSRF tokens to validate requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can trick an authenticated user into making unintentional requests to the web server.
*   This can allow the attacker to execute malicious actions against the application on behalf of the victim.
*   The impact is limited by the privileges of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a forged request that targets the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker then uses social engineering or phishing to induce an authenticated user to visit this page, causing the forged request to be executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require direct access to the vulnerable system.
*   They need the ability to host a malicious webpage and deceive a valid user to access it, while this user is logged into the vulnerable application.
* The attacker would require to understand the API calls needed to perform an action.

**Mitigation:**
*   The application configures the `SameSite` attribute to "Strict" for the `ci_session` token to reduce the impact.
*   It is recommended not to expose the web interface on the management port to untrusted networks.
*   Disabling the web interface can be a possible mitigation.
