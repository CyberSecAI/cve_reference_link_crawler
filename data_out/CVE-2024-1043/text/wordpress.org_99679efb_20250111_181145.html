After version v1.0.95, the AMP menu is all garbled.Reverting to v1.0.95 is the only way for it to work correctly.
It seems that a while has passed, and it still hasn’t been fixed.

We’ve used their plugins for some time but stopped because, in our view, AMP is no longer relevant. We believe Google may also abandon it soon.
The developers don’t send reminder emails before your renewal is due, and they refuse to issue a refund even if you inform them you no longer want to use their product on the day of renewal.
Avoid doing business with companies that have poor business ethics; they will likely let you down when you need their support.
