### Description

The AMP for WP – Accelerated Mobile Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'amppb\_remove\_saved\_layout\_data' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.93.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to delete arbitrary posts on the site.
