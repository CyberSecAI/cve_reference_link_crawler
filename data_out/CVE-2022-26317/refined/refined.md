- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The framework does not properly verify if the request to retrieve the result of a Microflow execution call was made by the same user who initiated the call. Combined with predictable identifiers for Microflow execution calls, this allows unauthorized access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284). The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation to ensure a user requesting the results of a Microflow execution call is the same user who initiated the call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve information about arbitrary Microflow execution calls made by other users, potentially exposing sensitive data. The impact is limited to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected system and be able to make requests to the system over the network. They also need to know or predict the identifiers for Microflow execution calls.
