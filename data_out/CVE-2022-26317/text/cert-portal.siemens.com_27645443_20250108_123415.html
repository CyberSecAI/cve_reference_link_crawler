An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:

Vulnerability CVE-2022-26317

When returning the result of a completed Microﬂow execution call the affected framework does not
correctly verify, if the request was initially made by the user requesting the result. Together with
predictable identiﬁers for Microﬂow execution calls, this could allow a malicious attacker to retrieve
information about arbitrary Microﬂow execution calls made by users within the affected system.
