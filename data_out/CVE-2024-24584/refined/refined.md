The provided content relates to CVE-2024-24584.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `readMSH` function of the libigl library when processing `.msh` files. Specifically, the code assumes that the number of entries in the `ElementData` section of the file is synchronized with the number of elements in the `Element` section. If the `Element` section contains more elements than corresponding entries in `ElementData`, an out-of-bounds read occurs when accessing the `element_fields` vector.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read in `MshLoader::ELEMENT_TET` when accessing the `TetF` array.
- The code does not validate if the number of elements in the `Element` section matches the expected number based on the `ElementData` section.
- The `field` vector within `igl::MshLoader::parse_element_field` is resized based on user-controlled input from `$ElementData` without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read by providing a specially crafted `.msh` file.
- The vulnerability can lead to information disclosure by leaking heap data, potentially allowing attackers to bypass ASLR or access other sensitive information.
- In scenarios where the library is used by a higher-privilege service, the out-of-bounds read can be exploited in the context of privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides a malicious `.msh` file to an application using the vulnerable `libigl` library.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `readMSH` function parses the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted `.msh` file to a vulnerable application that uses the libigl library.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
