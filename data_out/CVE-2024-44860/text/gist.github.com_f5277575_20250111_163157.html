 [Raw](/walhajri/e03974097d1fd4eb698a6a80931bdd45/raw/d5cfd136286d5191a5629c6c12877ae60ba17af5/Sensitive%2520Information%2520Disclosure%2520in%2520Solvait%2520version%252024.4.2.md)

[**Sensitive Information Disclosure in Solvait version 24.4.2.md**](#file-sensitive-information-disclosure-in-solvait-version-24-4-2-md)

# Sensitive Information Disclosure in PrintQr Page

## Description

A security flaw has been found in Solvait version 24.4.2 that exposes sensitive employee data through an unauthenticated endpoint, `/Letter/PrintQr/`. By manipulating the worker ID, an attacker can access the "Employee Certificate," which includes full name, organization ID, nationality, government ID, and salary information. This vulnerability impacts all employees within the company who utilize this version of the solution.

## Affected target

This vulnerability was tested and found on Solvait version 24.4.2

`https://<domain>/Letter/PrintQr?RequestId=<ID>&RequestLetterId=<ID>&company=<CompnayID>&worker=<ID>` (worker parameter)

## Severity

**CVSS Score:** (9.2 / Critical) CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N

**CWE-ID:** CWE-284

**Vulnerability Class:** Improper Access Control

## Impact

The vulnerability of an unauthenticated endpoint at `https://<domain>/Letter/PrintQr/` can be attributed to the manipulation of the worker ID parameter. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the worker ID in the URL to access the "Employee Certificate," which includes sensitive information such as full name, organization ID, nationality, government ID, and salary information. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially access confidential employee data, leading to privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and other security risks for the organization.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1- Navigate to `https://<domain>/Letter/PrintQr/`.

2- In the URL, Append query parameters for RequestId, RequestLetterId, company, and worker in the URL.

3- Modify the `worker` ID parameter.

4- Send the request.

5- Observe the response for the "Employee Certificate" containing sensitive information.
