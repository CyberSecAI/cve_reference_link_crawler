- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the UHCI USB controller.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. On ESXi, the exploitation is contained within the VMX sandbox. On Workstation and Fusion, this may lead to code execution on the machine where Workstation or Fusion is installed.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires local administrative privileges on a virtual machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local administrative privileges within a virtual machine.
