The provided content is related to a security fix in MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) concerning the upload of organization logos. The commit `312d2d5422235235ddd211dcb6bb5bb09c07791f` addresses vulnerabilities related to insecure file uploads, specifically for organization logos.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of uploaded logo files. Prior to the fix, there was inadequate checking of file size, extension, and MIME type, potentially allowing users to upload malicious files disguised as images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Insecure file upload:** Lack of proper checks on file size, extension, and MIME type allowed the potential upload of malicious files.
2. **Bypass of image format:**  It was possible to bypass the expected image formats (PNG, SVG) via a manipulated file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker could potentially upload malicious files (e.g., SVG files containing embedded scripts) that could be executed in the context of other users' browsers viewing the logo, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other malicious outcomes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the organization logo upload functionality within the MISP platform.
- An attacker needs to be authenticated to be able to access this functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be an authenticated user in MISP with the permission to upload or modify organization logos.

**Technical details:**
- The commit introduces several security checks:
    -   **Maximum file size:** Limits the logo file size to 250KB.
    -   **File extension check:** Only allows `.png` and `.svg` extensions.
    -   **MIME type check:** Verifies that the MIME type of the file matches the declared extension and that the image is a valid format. Specifically, it uses `exif_imagetype` for PNG validation and checks the mime type for svg.
    -  **SVG support configuration**: An additional check is done to determine if SVG logo uploads are enabled based on the `Security.enable_svg_logos` configuration.

This commit fixes an exploitable vulnerability by implementing proper file validation to prevent the upload of malicious files disguised as logos.
