- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ERE Recently Viewed WordPress plugin (versions <= 1.3) is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection. This type of vulnerability arises when user-supplied data is unserialized by the `unserialize()` PHP function without proper sanitization, which can lead to the instantiation of arbitrary objects and the execution of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to execute code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and more. The specific impact depends on the presence of a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin, exploiting the unserialization of user-supplied data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
