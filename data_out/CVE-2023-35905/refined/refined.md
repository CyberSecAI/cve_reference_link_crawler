Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the `FileNet DetailedStatus` parameter name within IBM FileNet Content Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input within the `DetailedStatus` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they access a page with the vulnerable parameter.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to impersonate the user.
    - **Information theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `DetailedStatus` parameter in a URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the vulnerable parameter.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim to click on the link or access the vulnerable page via another means to trigger the execution of the malicious script within the victim's browser.
- No information is provided about the user privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
