Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `ForPass.php` component of the Online Job Portal application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code. This occurs in the `ForPass.php` file when handling user input, specifically during the password reset process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Data breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, including user credentials, personal details, and job-related data.
- **Data modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious user input:** Attackers can inject SQL code through the `txtUserName`, `cmbQue`, and `txtAnswer` parameters in the password reset form (`ForPass.php`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic web interaction:** The attacker should be able to interact with the web application, specifically the password reset functionality.
- **SQL injection knowledge:** A basic understanding of SQL injection techniques is required to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided SQL injection payload is:
  `rdUser=JobSeeker&txtUserName=aa' OR NOT 5555=5555-- ZRQC&cmbQue=What is Your Pet Name?&txtAnswer=bb&button2=Submit`
- This payload attempts to bypass authentication by injecting an SQL condition (`OR NOT 5555=5555`) that always evaluates to true.
- This allows an attacker to potentially access or modify data without correct authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable application is identified as "Online Job Portal - 2020," available from SourceCodester.
- The `ForPass.php` file is the specific location of the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The application uses PHP and MySQL.
- The github repository contains an example of successful exploitation using sqlmap.
