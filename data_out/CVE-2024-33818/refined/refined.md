Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the Globitel KSA SpeechLog v8.1 application. The application uses the `userID` parameter from user-supplied input to access user objects directly without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses the `userID` parameter from the request to retrieve user information.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The application does not properly validate if the user making the request has the necessary privileges to access the information of the specified `userID`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A low-privilege user can access and view the information of other users, including:
    *   Registered user names
    *   Emails
    *   Passwords
    *   Usernames
    *   Other user-related details

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker intercepts the HTTP request to the `/api/User/Get` endpoint.
*   **Parameter Modification:** The attacker modifies the `userID` parameter in the request to access different user objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the application:** The attacker must have access to the SpeechLog application.
*   **Network Interception:**  The attacker needs to intercept network traffic, which can be achieved using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to understand how to modify parameters in HTTP requests.
