Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9224

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient pathname validation within the `hello_world_lyric()` function of the Hello World WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses `file_get_contents()` on a user-provided file path without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin allows an attacker to supply an arbitrary file path to the `hello_world_lyric()` function via the `hello_world_lyrics` user option. The `file_exists()` check is not sufficient to prevent path traversal, as it only verifies that the file exists, not whether it's within an intended directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The use of `file_get_contents()` allows the attacker to read the contents of any file that the web server user has permission to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing configuration files, database credentials, source code, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network (HTTP/HTTPS).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site. This allows the attacker to set the `hello_world_lyrics` user option and trigger the vulnerable code.

**Technical Details:**
The `hello_world_lyric()` function retrieves a file path from user options using `get_user_option('hello_world_lyrics', get_current_user_id())`. This path is then passed to `file_exists()` for a basic check, followed by `file_get_contents()` to read the file's content. The lack of proper path sanitization and restriction allows an attacker to provide an arbitrary file path leading to arbitrary file read.

**Affected Versions:**
*   All versions of the Hello World plugin up to and including 2.1.1

**Patched Version:**
*  2.2.0

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `hello-world.php` file, specifically within the `hello_world_lyric()` function (around line 35).
*   The provided code snippets confirm the vulnerable logic within the `hello_world_lyric()` function.
*   The `hello_world_options()` function (around line 113) allows setting the `hello_world_lyrics` user option, which is used in the vulnerable function.
