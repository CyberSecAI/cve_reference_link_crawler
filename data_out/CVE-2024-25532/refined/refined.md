Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities present in RuvarOA, as detailed in the provided GitHub Gist:

**Overview:** The document describes a code audit of the RuvarOA system, revealing multiple security vulnerabilities. These include numerous SQL injection flaws, unauthorized access issues, XSS vulnerabilities, and sensitive information disclosure vulnerabilities. Additionally, a system design flaw is highlighted.

**1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**

The primary root cause of these vulnerabilities is the direct concatenation of user-supplied input from HTTP request parameters (query string) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries. This makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Unsanitized user input in SQL queries
    *   Direct use of `Request.QueryString`
    *   Lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary data access, modification, or deletion from the database
    *   Potential for complete compromise of the database server and the webserver if combined with other vulnerabilities (writing to server through SQL injection).
    *   Ability to extract sensitive information like database usernames, passwords, and system data

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Manipulating the query string parameters like `template_id`, `id`, `attach_id`, `sys_file_storage_id`, `file_id`, `email_attach_id`, `contentid`, `office_missive_id`, `filename` ,`table` and `project_id`.
   *    POST requests to `get_company.aspx` by manipulating the `txt_keyword` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
    *   No prior authentication required in many of the cases.
*   **Vulnerable Paths and Files (DLLs are in `/RuvarOA/bin/`):**
    *   `/WorkPlan/plan_template_preview.aspx` (`WorkPlan.dll`)
    *   `/bulletin/bulletin_template_show.aspx` (`bulletin.dll`)
    *    `/Mobile/WorkFlow/wf_file_download.aspx` (`Mobile.dll`)
    *   `/AddressBook/address_public_show.aspx` (`AddressBook.dll`)

    *   `/SysManage/wf_template_child_field_list.aspx` (`SysManage.dll`)
    *   `/SysManage/sys_blogtemplate_new.aspx` (`SysManage.dll`)
    *   `/WebUtility/MF.aspx` (`WebUtility.dll`)
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_work_print.aspx` (`WorkFlow.dll`)
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_get_fields_approve.aspx` (`WorkFlow.dll`)
    *   `/WorkFlow/wf_work_form_save.aspx` (`WorkFlow.dll`)
    *   `/WorkPlan/WorkPlanAttachDownLoad.aspx` (`WorkPlan.dll`)
    *   `/filemanage/file_memo.aspx` (`filemanage.dll`)
    *    `/ContractManage/get_company.aspx` (`ContractManage.dll`)
    *    `/PersonalAffair/worklog_template_show.aspx` (`PersonalAffair.dll`)
    *    `/ProjectManage/pm_gatt_inc.aspx` (`ProjectManage.dll`)
    *    `/WorkFlow/OfficeFileDownload.aspx` (`WorkFlow.dll`)
     *   `/WorkFlow/wf_work_stat_setting.aspx` (`WorkFlow.dll`)
     *   `/WorkFlow/wf_office_file_history_show.aspx` (`WorkFlow.dll`)
    *  `/WebUtility/SearchCondiction.aspx` (`WebUtility.dll`)
    *   `/WebUtility/get_find_condiction.aspx` (`WebUtility.dll`)
    *  `/include/get_dict.aspx` (`include.dll`)

**2. Information Leakage and Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:**

*   **Weaknesses**:
    *   Error messages reveal the physical paths.
    *   Lack of access control on file download pages, allowing direct access to files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Disclosure of the physical path of the website and the ability to download arbitrary files.
    *   Potential for attackers to gain further insight into the system's structure and potentially exploit other vulnerabilities.
*  **Attack Vectors**:
    * Accessing  `/WorkFlow/OfficeFileUpdate.aspx`  results in error message which discloses the web server's physical path.
    *   Accessing `/asset/asset_file_search_left.aspx` discloses server information.
    *   Iterating over `contentid` or `email_attach_id` values of `/Mobile/LHMail/AttachDown.aspx`  allows for the downloading of corresponding file types.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**3. XSS Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Direct output of URL parameters onto the page without proper encoding.
*  **Impact:**
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) can be exploited to inject malicious scripts, leading to session hijacking, defacement of the website, and potentially more advanced attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Manipulating the `PageTitle` parameter in `/SysManage/emailset_outside.aspx`
    *   Manipulating the `template_name` parameter in `/WebUtility/common_new_top.aspx`, `/WebUtility/common_show.aspx`, `/WebUtility/common_show_top.aspx`, and `/WebUtility/common_deal.aspx`, `/WebUtility/common_deal_top.aspx`
     *  Manipulating the `AutoPrint` parameter in `/WorkFlow/wf_work_print.aspx`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
    *   No prior authentication required.

**4. System Design Flaw**

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Exposing `dSql.aspx` which allows a user to generate SQL scripts.
    *   Generating log files which are accessible through a predictable path.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Generation of SQL scripts for the application that could expose sensitive information or aid an attacker if a user has access to the page.
    *   Exposing a log file that could expose sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    * Accessing `/WebUtility/dSql.aspx` allows for the generation of SQL scripts.
   * Accessing files in `/logfiles/` allows for the download of log files that could expose sensitive information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints,

**Affected Products:**

*   RuvarOA V6.01
*   RuvarOA V12.01

In summary, the analysis points to a poorly coded application with several severe vulnerabilities that could easily be exploited to compromise the entire system. The issues stem from a lack of secure coding practices such as input validation, parameterization, and proper output encoding. These issues, if combined, can lead to a full system compromise.
