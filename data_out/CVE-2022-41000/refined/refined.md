```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` with unchecked input sizes when parsing commands, leading to stack-based buffer overflows. The size of the `command_parameter_X` is not checked against the size of `stack_buffer`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to unchecked input sizes in `sprintf` calls within `DetranCLI` command parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted network packet with an overly long string for a command parameter to trigger the vulnerable `sprintf` within `DetranCLI`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and have access to the `DetranCLI` interface. Based on the CVSS vector, the attacker requires high privileges."
