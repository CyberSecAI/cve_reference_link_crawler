- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in several functions hooked to `admin_init`. This allows unauthenticated users to call these functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization and CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated user can unlink arbitrary users' Instagram accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a specific URL and sending it to the target site
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send a crafted URL to the vulnerable site. No specific user interaction or authentication is required.
