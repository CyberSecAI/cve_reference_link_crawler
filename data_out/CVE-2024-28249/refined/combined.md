# Possible unencrypted traffic between nodes when using IPsec and L7 policies

Moderate

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-j89h-qrvr-xc36
Mar 18, 2024

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

< 1.13.13
>= 1.14.0, < 1.14.8
>= 1.15.0, < 1.15.2

## Patched versions

1.13.13
1.14.8
1.15.2

## Description

### Impact

In Cilium clusters with IPsec enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies:

* Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted
* Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted

**Note:** For clusters running in native routing mode, IPsec encryption is not applied to connections which are selected by a L7 Egress Network Policy or a DNS Policy. This is a known limitation of Cilium's IPsec encryption which will continue to apply after upgrading to the latest Cilium versions described below.

### Patches

This issue affects:

* Cilium v1.15 before v1.15.2
* Cilium v1.14 before v1.14.8
* Cilium v1.13 before v1.13.13
* Cilium v1.4 to v1.12 inclusive

This issue has been resolved in:

* Cilium v1.15.2
* Cilium v1.14.8
* Cilium v1.13.13

### Workarounds

There is no workaround to this issue.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
