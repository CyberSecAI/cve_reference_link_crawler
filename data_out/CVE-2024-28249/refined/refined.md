The content is related to CVE-2024-28249.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly apply IPsec encryption to traffic between a node's Envoy or DNS proxy and pods on other nodes when Layer 7 policies are in place.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unencrypted traffic: Traffic intended to be encrypted via IPsec is sent in plaintext. This applies to traffic between a node's Envoy proxy or DNS proxy and pods on other nodes when Layer 7 policies are in effect.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Confidentiality breach: Sensitive data transmitted between nodes can be intercepted by unauthorized parties due to the lack of encryption.
- Data exposure: An attacker with access to network traffic could read the unencrypted data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network eavesdropping: An attacker positioned within the network can intercept the unencrypted traffic.
- Adjacent network: The vulnerability can be exploited from an adjacent network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network or have the ability to intercept traffic between the affected nodes.
- No privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.
