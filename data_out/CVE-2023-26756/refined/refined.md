Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary issue highlighted is the susceptibility of the Revive Adserver login page to brute-force attacks due to insufficient security measures. The blog post and the vendor response highlight differing views, with the blog post claiming that a lack of rate limiting, weak passwords, predictable usernames, and absence of account lockouts are the reasons for vulnerability. The vendor disputes this and states that measures are in place since 2016.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present (according to the blog post):**

*   **Lack of rate limiting:** The login page does not adequately restrict the number of login attempts within a specific timeframe, allowing attackers to make numerous attempts rapidly.
*   **Weak passwords:** The system (prior to version 5.4.0) may permit users to set easily guessed passwords, though this is disputed by the vendor who notes that passwords must have at least 12 characters.
*   **Lack of account lockout:** There is no mechanism to automatically lock out user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
*   **Predictable usernames:** The system might permit users to select predictable usernames, facilitating targeted brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful brute-force attacks would allow attackers to gain access to administrative accounts.
*   **System Compromise:** Gaining administrative access could lead to further malicious actions such as data theft, modification of advertisements, or complete compromise of the ad server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack is conducted remotely via the application's login page.
*   **Automated Tools:** Attackers use automated software or scripts (e.g., via Burp Suite Intruder) to launch brute-force attacks by trying multiple username/password combinations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the Revive Adserver login page via network.
*   **Basic knowledge of Burp suite or similar tools:** The attacker needs to be able to use tools that can automate brute force attacks
*   **Password Lists:** The attacker may require a dictionary of common passwords or a list of targeted credentials to increase the success rate.

**Additional notes based on the vendor response:**

*   The vendor claims they implemented a delay between login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks since 2016. They introduced a random delay of 1-5 seconds for failed authentication and a 4 times longer delay for concurrent authentication attempts.
*   They highlight that with the release of v5.4.0 a password length requirement of 12 characters was implemented and the zxcvbn library is used to indicate password strength.
*   They consider the PoC unrealistic since it found a password at the 212th request.
*   They emphasize that they take security very seriously and intend to implement stronger protections such as account lockouts and multi-factor authentication.

**Summary:**

The blog post describes a brute force vulnerability in Revive Adserver, specifically in version 5.4.1, due to the lack of rate limiting and other account security measures. It provides a detailed Proof of Concept showing how an attacker can compromise user accounts. The vendor acknowledges the report but rejects the assertion of vulnerability. They clarify that rate limiting mechanisms were implemented in 2016 and that password strength requirements have been improved in later versions. The vulnerability described in the blog post is still relevant even if the vendor has implemented counter-measures.

The vendor's response provides context and a different perspective. It emphasizes that the vendor already has some security measures in place and that the described attack scenario may be unrealistic.
