**Overview:-**

Revive Adserver 5.4.1
vulnerable to Brute Force attack attacker can do brute and attack can gain password.

.

**Details**

A login page that is
vulnerable to a brute force attack is a serious security vulnerability. Brute
force attacks are a common method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access
to a system by repeatedly trying different combinations of usernames and
passwords until they find the correct one.

A vulnerable login
page can be exploited by an attacker using automated software or tools to
launch a brute force attack. The attack can be successful if the login page
does not have sufficient measures in place to prevent or mitigate the attack.

Some of the factors
that can make a login page vulnerable to brute force attacks include:

Weak passwords: If the
system allows users to choose weak passwords that can be easily guessed, then
the attacker can use brute force techniques to try out different password
combinations and eventually gain access.

Lack of account
lockout: A login page that does not have an account lockout feature can be
exploited by an attacker who can keep trying different combinations of
usernames and passwords without being locked out after a certain number of failed
attempts.

Predictable usernames:
If the login page allows users to choose predictable usernames, such as their
email addresses, then attackers can use this information to launch a targeted
brute force attack.

Lack of rate limiting:
A login page that does not have rate limiting can be exploited by an attacker
who can keep trying different combinations of usernames and passwords at a very
high rate, overwhelming the system and eventually gaining access.

**Steps of PoC**

**Step -1 in this step
attack navigate to revive login  page <http://localhost/revive/www/admin/index.php> and attack will be try to
login**

**Step-2
attack will intercept the request via Burpsuite proxy**

**Step-4 in this step attacker will set the
payload for brute force attack.**

**Steps of remediation for brute force attack**

To prevent brute force attacks on a login
page, it is important to implement strong security measures such as:

Enforcing strong password policies and
requiring users to choose complex passwords that are difficult to guess.

Implementing an account lockout feature
that locks out users after a certain number of failed login attempts.

Using unpredictable usernames and not
allowing users to choose predictable usernames such as their email addresses.

Implementing rate limiting to limit the
number of login attempts that can be made within a certain time period.
