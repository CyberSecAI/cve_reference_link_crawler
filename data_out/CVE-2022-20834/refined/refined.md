- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. In some cases, it could also cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted input into various data fields in the affected interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated, remote attacker. The attacker needs to have a valid account on the affected system to be able to insert the malicious code.
