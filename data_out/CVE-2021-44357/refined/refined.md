{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cgiserver.cgi` process manages API requests, parsing commands and parameters provided in a JSON array within the request body. The code assumes that the JSON elements, especially the 'param' element, are always objects. However, by sending a crafted request where the 'param' value is not an object (e.g., an empty string), it leads to an assertion failure, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the device to reboot.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The `cgiserver.cgi` does not properly validate the type of JSON elements, specifically the 'param' element within the JSON command structure, before using it in subsequent operations.",
     "Denial of Service Vulnerability: By sending crafted requests with incorrect JSON types for the 'param' element, an attacker can trigger an assertion failure, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the device to reboot, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Lack of Type Checking: There is a lack of type checking on the JSON elements within the 'param' field. This results in the program attempting to access a non-object as an object using the subscription operator."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service condition where the device reboots, disrupting its intended functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the device's API endpoint `/cgi-bin/api.cgi`, with a JSON payload in the body. The JSON payload contains commands with the 'param' value set to a non-object (e.g., an empty string).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera. While most of these attacks require authentication, they can be performed without authentication by using the vulnerability described in TALOS-2021-1420."
