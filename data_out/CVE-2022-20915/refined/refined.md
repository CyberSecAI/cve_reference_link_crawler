- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper error handling of an IPv6 packet that is forwarded from an MPLS and ZBFW-enabled interface in a 6VPE deployment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper error handling. Specifically, the vulnerability exists when an IPv6 packet traverses an interface configured for both MPLS and Zone-Based Firewall (ZBFW) in a 6VPE setup.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reload the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted IPv6 packet sourced from a device on the IPv6-enabled virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) interface through the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
