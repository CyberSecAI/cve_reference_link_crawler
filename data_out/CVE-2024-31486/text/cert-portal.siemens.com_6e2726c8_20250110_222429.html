WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.
Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.
As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-31484

The affected devices contain an improper null termination vulnerability while parsing a specific HTTP header. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process or lead to denial of service condition.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 7.3 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-170: Improper Null Termination |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-31485

The web interface of affected devices is vulnerable to command injection due to missing server side input sanitation. This could allow an authenticated privileged remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.2 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 8.6 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-31486

The affected devices stores MQTT client passwords without sufficient protection on the devices. An attacker with remote shell access or physical access could retrieve the credentials leading to confidentiality loss.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 5.3 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 6.0 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information |
