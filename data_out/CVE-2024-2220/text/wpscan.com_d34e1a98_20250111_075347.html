## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Button contact VR < 4.7.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Button Contact > Hotline settings: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
