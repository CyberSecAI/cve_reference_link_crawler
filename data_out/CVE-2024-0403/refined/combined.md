## Support our work

Tandoor is developed by volunteers in their free time just because its fun. That said earning
some money with the project allows us to spend more time on it and thus make improvements we otherwise couldn't.
Because of that there are several ways you can support us

* **GitHub Sponsors** You can sponsor contributors of this project on GitHub: [vabene1111](https://github.com/sponsors/vabene1111)
* **Host at Hetzner** We have been very happy customers of Hetzner for multiple years for all of our projects. If you want to get into self-hosting or are tired of the expensive big providers, their cloud servers are a great place to get started. When you sign up via our [referral link](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=ISdlrLmr9kGj) you will get 20€ worth of cloud credits and we get a small kickback too.
* **Let us host for you** We are offering a [hosted version](https://app.tandoor.dev) where all profits support us and the development of tandoor (currently only available in germany).

## License

Beginning with version 0.10.0 the code in this repository is licensed under the [GNU AGPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.de.html) license with a
[common clause](https://commonsclause.com/) selling exception. See [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/vabene1111/recipes/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) for details.

> NOTE: There appears to be a whole range of legal issues with licensing anything other than the standard completely open licenses.
> I am in the process of getting some professional legal advice to sort out these issues.
> Please also see [Issue 238](https://github.com/vabene1111/recipes/issues/238) for some discussion and **reasoning** regarding the topic.

**Reasoning**
**This software and *all* its features are and will always be free for everyone to use and enjoy.**

The reason for the selling exception is that a significant amount of time was spend over multiple years to develop this software.
A paid hosted version which will be identical in features and code base to the software offered in this repository will
likely be released in the future (including all features needed to sell a hosted version as they might also be useful for personal use).
This will not only benefit me personally but also everyone who self-hosts this software as any profits made through selling the hosted option
allow me to spend more time developing and improving the software for everyone. Selling exceptions are [approved by Richard Stallman](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.en.html) and the
common clause license is very permissive (see the [FAQ](https://commonsclause.com/)).
