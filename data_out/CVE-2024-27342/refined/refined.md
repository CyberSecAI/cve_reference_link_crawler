- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PDF files within Kofax Power PDF, specifically due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This lack of validation can lead to a write operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Kofax Power PDF.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious PDF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF file or lure the victim to a malicious web page to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required, specifically the user needs to open the malicious file or visit the malicious webpage.
