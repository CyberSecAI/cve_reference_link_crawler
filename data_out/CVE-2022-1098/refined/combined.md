### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Michael Heinzl and Dusan Stevanovic of Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

**--------- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------**

Delta Electronics has fixed the reported vulnerabilities and recommends users [upgrade to version 1.9](https://downloadcenter.deltaww.com/en-US/DownloadCenter?v=1&q=DIAEnergie%20V1.9&sort_expr=cdate&sort_dir=DESC) or later

**--------- End Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------**

Delta also suggests users:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against “Path Traversal” and “SQL Injection” weakness.
* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing a VPN is only as secure as its connected devices

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
