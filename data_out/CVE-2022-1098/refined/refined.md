Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-1098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The DIAEnergie software is vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The application loads DLLs from an uncontrolled search path.
*   **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):**  This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2022-26839, allows an attacker to place malicious DLLs, which are then loaded due to the uncontrolled search path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Combined with the incorrect default permissions vulnerability, an attacker can escalate their privileges by placing and loading a malicious DLL. This could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code with higher privileges than they initially possessed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where DIAEnergie is installed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a low-privileged account on the target system.
*   **File Write Access:** The attacker must be able to write files in locations where DIAEnergie will search for and load DLLs. This is facilitated by the incorrect default permissions vulnerability (CVE-2022-26839).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document explicitly states this vulnerability (CVE-2022-1098) is exploitable when combined with the incorrect default permissions vulnerability (CVE-2022-26839).
*   The document also mentions that the vendor has released version 1.9 of the software, which patches this and other listed vulnerabilities.
