```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fromAddressNat` function in Tenda FH1205 firmware uses user-provided input from the `entrys` parameter of a POST request in a `sprintf` call without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack overflow",
    "Uncontrolled format string"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The stack overflow allows overwriting of the return address, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/goform/addressNat` with a large value for the `entrys` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device, implying network access to the device."
