### Description

The InstaWP Connect – 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file validation in the /wp-json/instawp-connect/v1/config REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.0.22. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files.
