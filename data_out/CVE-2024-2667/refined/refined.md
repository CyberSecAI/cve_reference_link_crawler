### Summary:
The provided content describes a critical vulnerability, **CVE-2024-2667**, affecting the InstaWP Connect WordPress plugin. It allows unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files due to insufficient file validation in the `/wp-json/instawp-connect/v1/config` REST API endpoint.

**Root Cause:**
Insufficient file validation within the `/wp-json/instawp-connect/v1/config` REST API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unrestricted file upload.
- Lack of proper validation of uploaded files, leading to the ability to upload arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file upload can lead to remote code execution, website defacement, data breaches, and other severe consequences, potentially leading to full compromise of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint `/wp-json/instawp-connect/v1/config`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no authentication or special privileges.
- The attacker can be remote (i.e., does not need to be on the same network or have local access).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by researcher AtaTurk1925.
- The vulnerable versions are up to and including 0.1.0.22.
- The patched version is 0.1.0.23, which includes the fix for the file upload vulnerability.
- The fix appears to involve some changes in how the `override_plugin_zip` parameter is handled within the `config()` function of the `class-instawp-rest-api.php`.
- The changeset also shows a new API endpoint `/post-cleanup` was introduced to handle post migration cleanup, and also additional checks were added to `class-instawp-tools.php`  to ensure that the files are both readable and valid before adding to a zip archive for local push.
