The provided content is related to CVE-2024-29275.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data in the `id` parameter within the `dmku/index.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands directly into the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability
- Unauthenticated access to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:
- Data exfiltration
- Data modification or deletion
- Full database compromise
- Server compromise by executing SQL queries that interact with the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests
- Manipulation of the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication required.
- Network access to the vulnerable web server.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `js/player/dmplayer/dmku/class/mysqli.class.php`, specifically in the function that processes the `id` parameter.
- The attacker can use SQL injection techniques such as `sleep` to confirm the injection and potentially extract data.
- The PoC exploits demonstrate how the `id` parameter can be used to inject a `select sleep(n)` payload to cause a time delay, confirming successful SQL injection.
