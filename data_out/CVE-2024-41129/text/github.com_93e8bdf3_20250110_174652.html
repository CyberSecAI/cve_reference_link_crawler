# Leaking secrets if `subprocess.CalledProcessError` happens with a `secret-\*` CLI command

## Affected versions

2.0.0 - 2.14.1

## Patched versions

## Description

### Summary

The issue here is that we pass the secret content as one of the args via CLI. This issue may affect any of our charms that are using: Juju (>=3.0), Juju secrets and not correctly capturing and processing `subprocess.CalledProcessError`.

There are two points I can see we may log this command, in different files:

First, if we have an error during a secret handling, we will get `subprocess.CalledProcessError`, which will contain the CLI comand + all its args. This is going to be logged in any logging level. This exception, if not caught by the charm, will bubble up to the `/var/log/juju/` logs and syslog journal. Now, on Ubuntu 22.04, these logs are protected with:

```
$ juju ssh -m controller 0 -- ls -la /var/log/juju/
total 224
drwxr-xr-x 2 syslog adm      4096 Jul 14 10:59 .
drwxrwxr-x 9 root   syslog   4096 Jul 14 10:58 ..
-rw-r----- 1 syslog adm     20124 Jul 14 11:10 audit.log
-rw-r----- 1 syslog adm    110432 Jul 14 11:10 logsink.log
-rw-r----- 1 syslog adm     80783 Jul 14 11:06 machine-0.log
-rw-r----- 1 syslog adm       766 Jul 14 11:10 machine-lock.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root        0 Jul 14 10:59 slow-query.log
-rw-r----- 1 syslog adm      3732 Jul 14 11:10 unit-controller-0.log

```

Second, I believe certain audit setups may log terminal commands, which would result in this command being logged with its secrets. I am not sure if this is done on ubuntu security benchmarks, such as CIS hardening.

We should keep in mind these logs may be copied or even backed up. Which exposes it to more services in the user's environment (e.g. my case, CI runs in GH - although these are dummy password generated per test only).

I'd say passing secrets straight via CLI is not advised. I see some ways out:

1. Redacting: we know which commands and which args represent secrets, then we can redact these. It would also mean capturing a `subprocess.CalledProcessError`, redacting its content and reissuing the same type of exception; this will not cover the case `auditd` is set to log CLI commands, if that is a risk
2. Temp files: secret-add, for example, can use a secret file instead, [as can be seen here](https://github.com/juju/juju/blob/20b7d944acc985ce91419728529d5fb2abd14d68/cmd/juju/secrets/add.go#L62). However, if we use a file, we need to be sure we will correctly remove it later
3. stdin: I am not sure it is accepted by secret-\* commands, but generally, secrets are not shown on CLI whilst typing them; I am not sure if auditd would capture that stdin

In any case, I recommend to discuss with security team what is the best path here.

### Severity Rationale

This is a [CWE-532](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html). Potentially, these secrets can lead to privilege escalation but Ubuntu default is to have logs only accessible to `adm` group users. I will not add [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) for now.

Marking this issue as "Moderate", as this report is not presenting a clear way on how to get access to the logs themselves: either getting local access to an `adm` group user (e.g. ubuntu) or recovering logs stored on a 3rd party service.

From CI: <https://github.com/canonical/opensearch-operator/actions/runs/9908987369/job/27376377521?pr=364>

### PoC

1. Deploy anything with juju
2. Run a dummy secret-add call that will fail
3. See the uncaught subprocess error

### Impact

Juju secrets are generally composed of private keys, passwords, etc; generally valuable credentials that, if leaked, will likely allow an attacker to get privileged access to its target or other targets in the environment.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-41129

### Weaknesses

[CWE-532](/advisories?query=cwe%3A532)
