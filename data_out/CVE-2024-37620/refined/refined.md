Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter within the `/phpvod/module/video/extension/upload/server/view/admin/view.php` file of PHPVOD v4.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied input through the `id` parameter is directly embedded into the HTML output without any encoding or sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `id` parameter. For example:
    `http://192.168.0.10:1020/admin/video/video/add.html?id=%3C/script%3E%3Csvg%20onload=alert(1)%3E`
    *   This specific PoC injects an `alert(1)` to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to induce a victim to click on the crafted URL, typically through social engineering or other methods (e.g., embedding in a malicious link).
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or access on the server side.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is present in the `uploaded.init_item()` function where the unsanitized `id` parameter is embedded.
* The vulnerable code snippet is: `uploaded.init_item(<?=phpvod::$app->request->get('id') ?? 0?>, $("#hash_set").val());`
