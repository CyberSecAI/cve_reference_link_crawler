Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of query parameters in the `/users` endpoint of the backend API. Specifically, the `sortDirection` parameter was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `sortDirection` query parameter was not restricted to the allowed values "asc" or "desc" before the fix.
- **Type Confusion/Injection:** The code used `z.union([z.literal("acs"), z.literal("desc")])` to validate the input type for 'sortDirection'. However, the typo in 'asc' as 'acs' suggests that input values outside of the expected "asc" or "desc" were likely not being correctly validated due to the typo and would have been passed through.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential for injection**: While the provided information is limited and doesn't go into full exploitation details, an attacker may have been able to manipulate the query parameter to inject malicious data.
- **Potential for unexpected behaviour or application crash**:  Although the details aren't present in this diff, improper validation of query params could have caused a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET method to the `/users` API endpoint.
- Attackers can manipulate the `sortDirection` query parameter by providing arbitrary string values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/users` API endpoint.
- No specific authentication is mentioned, but the `checkAccess("users", "list")` function suggests that access control might be present, so the attacker would likely have to be an authenticated user to exploit it or this could possibly be an access control bypass.

**Additional Notes**
The fix appears to be applying validation using the correct literal value for "asc", `z.literal("asc")`, instead of the typo `z.literal("acs")`.
The provided information suggests that the vulnerability has been patched in commit `6a0bc201181e0f4a0cc375ccf4ef0d7ae65c8a8e`
