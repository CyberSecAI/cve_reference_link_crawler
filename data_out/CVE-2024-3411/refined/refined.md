      "description": "The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) implementations in multiple manufacturer's Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software are vulnerable to IPMI session hijacking. An attacker with access to the BMC network (with IPMI enabled) can abuse the lack of session integrity to hijack sessions and execute arbitrary IPMI commands on the BMC.  The first vulnerability identifies the use of weak randomization while interacting with a BMC using IPMI sessions.  The researcher discovered that if both the IPMI session ID and BMC's random number are predictable or constant, an attacker can either hijack a session or replay a session without knowing the password that was set to protect the BMC. The second vulnerability from the reporter identifies certain cases where the BMC software fails to enforce previously negotiated IPMI 2.0 session parameters, allowing an attacker to either downgrade or disable session verification. An unauthenticated attacker with access to the BMC network can predict IPMI session IDs and/or BMC random numbers to replay a previous session or hijack an IPMI session. This can allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the BMC and be able to perform high-privileged functions (reboot, power-off, re-image of the machine) that are available to the BMC. The recommendation is to apply software updates and restrict network access to the BMC network."
