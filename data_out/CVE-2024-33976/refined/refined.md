- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization of the 'id' parameter in the `/admin/user/index.php` endpoint of the E-Negosyo System 1.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send a specially crafted JavaScript payload to an authenticated user. This can lead to partial takeover of the user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the 'id' parameter in the `/admin/user/index.php` URL. The victim needs to be authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and lure an authenticated user into clicking it.
