- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to missing authorization, authentication or nonce token checks in a function. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can perform actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through a function that lacks proper authorization checks, accessible to unprivileged users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber (unprivileged user) to exploit this vulnerability.
