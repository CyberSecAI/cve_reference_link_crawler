The provided content is a security bulletin for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) which includes information for CVE-2024-20784.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS), where malicious scripts are injected and stored within the application, leading to execution when users interact with the affected content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data breaches, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker injects malicious code into the application. A victim user with lower privileges must then interact with the malicious content to trigger the execution of the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges to inject the malicious payload and a user with higher privilege must trigger the XSS via a user interaction.
