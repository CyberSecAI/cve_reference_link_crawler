Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4452

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Google Language Translator plugin for WordPress. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts through multiple parameters.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.
*   The plugin does not sufficiently escape output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   If a user clicks on a malicious link crafted by the attacker, the injected script will execute within the user's browser.
*   This vulnerability affects users of older browsers (e.g. IE <= 9) that lack proper URL encoding support.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Attackers craft malicious links with embedded JavaScript code in parameters.
*   The victim must be tricked into clicking the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious link.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The victim must be using an older browser without proper URL encoding support.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.0.10 of the plugin by implementing proper escaping of user input in HTML attributes.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ram Gall from Wordfence.
*   The fix involved changes to the `google-language-translator.php` file to use `esc_url()`, `esc_attr()` and `htmlspecialchars()` functions and `html_entity_decode()`.
*   The vulnerability also impacts users with author role who can execute javascript code via glt shortcode
