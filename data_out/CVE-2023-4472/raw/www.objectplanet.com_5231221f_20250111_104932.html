<ul>
	<li>Added: Manage invitees screen now shows who has completed the survey response in the list (unless full anonymity is enabled).</li>
	<li>Matrix enhancement: Formulas in the matrix question caused issues if it showed "####" as the result of a calculation (f.example division by 0). It made it impossible to navigate to next/previous page. Now just clears the field.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: The privacy/security page did not always show correct level (display issue only).</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Fixed security vulnerability related to password retrieval.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Added: Added plugin API support for injecting text into the top of a survey page (below title and the first section heading).</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Adding questions to/from a library produced an error. Introduced in 7.21.</li>
</ul>

<P><span class="strong">Opinio Version 7.21</span> December 23rd, 2022</p>

</ul>

<P><span class="strong">Opinio Version 7.20</span> September 9th, 2022</p>

<ul>
	<li>Security update: Log4j upgrade to 2.17.2.</li>
	<li>Enhancement: configurable autocomplete attribute for the survey form was added. v7.13 set all survey HTML form elements to "autocomplete=off" for security reasons. This caused values not to be cached on the first survey page when the respondent clicked the browser back-button. Now configurable in the opinio.properties file.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Workaround for Firefox on the survey form. When clicking the browser back-button, Firefox thinks the form next-button is still clicked.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Introduction text was not shown in survey print.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Survey print error if a matrix question did not have any rows.</li>

	<li>Fixed bug: Error in raw data export if report was not specified (used when exporting via API).</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: "Most active surveys" did not work on the System status screen on Firefox.</li>

<ul>
	<li><span class="strong">This is a security update</span>. We recommend Java 1.7.40 or newer, due to security capabilities of newer java versions. Opinio is less secure with older versions of Java 1.7.</li>
	<li>Added: New password policy features; now possible to configure minimum letters, minimum digits, minimum special characters, and minimum lower/uppercase letters. Configured in the opinio.properties file.</li>
	<li>Added: Password history (encrypted), preventing users to reuse passwords. Configured in the opinio.properties file.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: The content of the matrix cell tooltip help was shown at the bottom of the survey page (in addition to the tooltip) due to changes in behavior in the updated jQuery UI library.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Quick-edit of cell labels in the matrix column/row editor did not work properly in Firefox and Safari. Labels were all listed on the same line.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Matrix cell help text did no longer work with HTML formatting after jQuery UI update due to changes in the jQuery UI tooltip behavior.</li>

	<li>Added: Suppressed browser autocomplete on the survey form, for those browsers that support it (most modern browsers do). Added by including the autocomplete=off attribute to HTML input and form tags.</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Increased upload limit for files in resources: 8 MB</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Possible XSS vulnerability removed from ajax-calls (related to the jQuery library).</li>
	<li>Enhancement: The jQuery library was updated to 3.5.1 (was 1.12). <span class="strong">Internet Explorer 8 and older is no longer supported</span>. This fixes some XSS vulnerabilities.</li>

</ul>

<P><span class="strong">Opinio Version 7.10</span> November 16th, 2018</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added: Optional MISSING values in the CSV data export (raw data), indicating form fields seen by the respondent, but not responded to.</li>
	<li>Change: Raw data export is no longer producing zeros for non-selected checkboxes (checked=1, unchecked=0) on the survey form if the question was not seen by the respondent.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: For admins: Some logging statements relating to clustering were written to standard out. These statements did not react to the log level set for the module, resulting in a lot of debug-level statements.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: in-text field names allowed characters that should not be used, because it caused issues with import/export of surveys. Characters disallowed changed from [<>"] to [#\%<>+&";'], not including the square brackets.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Survey locks not released on user deletion.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Branching filters were not updated correctly when the respondent was using back button and changing responses for questions with branching conditions. Only happened when questions affected by filter also had conditions attached.</li>

	<li>Fixed bug: Translations could in some cases become "out of sync" with surveys having questions with in-text fields.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Fixed error when moving surveys/folders, due to an upgrade of a 3rd party library (BeanUtils).</li>
	<li>Fixed bug: Too much logging when in clustered mode and multiple clusters on the same network. Caused by upgrade of the logging API in 7.8.</li>

<P><span class="strong">Opinio Version 7.9</span> April 11th, 2018</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added: Ability to include choices based on conditions in multiple choice type questions (previously it was only possible to filter away choices).</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Vulnerability removed that enabled attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code via the class parameter.</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Added the ability to style disabled ranking cells in the matrix (by editing the survey CSS), to make it possible to more easily see the difference between disabled and enabled cells.</li>
	<li>Enhancement: When creating/editing invitations, the invitation could not be saved with invalid/missing survey id. Now you can, but needs to be confirmed by user.</li>

	<li>Improved: Logs the progress of indexing search to log file (every 10 sec) instead of all folders, which would fill up the logfile if the number of folders is large.</li>
	<li>Improved: Increased the default size of cache for folders to 20mb (was 5mb).</li>
	<li>Improved: First login after restart could take a long time due to loading of survey/folder lists into cache. Now done in a background thread.</li>

	<li>Improved: Increased stability of response data export. It could fail on rare occasions if a respondent flag incorrectly indicated that additional attributes existed.</li>
	<li>Improved: For admins: Made Opinio's temp folder configurable in the opinio.properties file.</li>
	<li>Improved: Reduced the size of the report cache - this would potentially take too much memory, especially for reports containing information for a lot of questions/responses. Should reduce memory usage with minimal impact on performance.</li>
	<li>Bug fixed: Error during startup - got error when retrieving DB version on DB2.</li>
	<li>Bug fixed: On rare occasions, reports files were generated in multiple threads simultaneously for the same report (and same report type). Could cause memory/CPU spike.</li>
</ul>

<P><span class="strong">Opinio Version 7.6.5</span> June 2nd, 2017</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added: User account password expiration. Number of days to expiration is configurable (feature is disabled by default).</li>

	<li>Improved: If survey preview-URL is accessed outside the preview window, a "preview" notice is displayed to avoid confusion with viewing a live survey.</li>
	<li>Improved: For server admins: handled possible security error when setting the system property ENABLE_CLEAR_REFERENCES that is used by Tomcat. It now logs the security exception instead of failing to start.</li>
	<li>Bug fixed: Matrix formula did not always compute.</li>
	<li>Bug fixed: Non-super users needed access to invitations in order to modify a survey (only modify should be required). Introduced in 7.5.</li>

	does not apply in most cases, because ADMIN access to user is the most

	was installed on the same computer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Known problems:
	<ul>
		<li>Online users will be logged out when shutting down a cluster
		member gracefully. This is caused by a removal of session attributes
		before the session ends. When a cluster member is taken down by, say,
		killing the running webserver process the online users will still be
		logged in.</li>
		<li>If a file is not found on the original location, the cluster
		member will try to download the file from another cluster member. The
		file will not be found if the web servers on the cluster members are
		configured with different ports. SOLUTION: Keep the port number on all
		cluster members the same.</li>
