    before the session ends. When a cluster member is taken down by, say,
    killing the running webserver process the online users will still be
    logged in.
  + If a file is not found on the original location, the cluster
    member will try to download the file from another cluster member. The
    file will not be found if the web servers on the cluster members are
    configured with different ports. SOLUTION: Keep the port number on all
    cluster members the same.
