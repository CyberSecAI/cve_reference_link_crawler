# technology.openj9 With -Xgc:concurrentScavenge on IBM Z, arraycopy sequence could write or read into buffer beyond the end of array range

The Eclipse Foundation is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE) Numbering Authority. This issue it used to request and track the progress of the assignment of a CVE for a vulnerability in the project code for an Eclipse open source project.

## Basic information

**Project name:** OpenJ9

**Project id:** technology.openj9

**Request type:** publication

**Versions affected:** [0.13.0,0.43.0]

**Common Weakness Enumeration:**

* [CWE-805 - Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/805.html)
* [CWE-125 - Out-of-bounds Read](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)
* [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System:** {[cvss](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)}

**Summary:**

In Eclipse OpenJ9 release versions prior to 0.44.0 and after 0.13.0, when running with JVM option -Xgc:concurrentScavenge, the sequence generated for System.arrayCopy on the IBM Z platform with hardware and software support for guarded storage [1], could allow access to a buffer with an incorrect length value when executing an arraycopy sequence while the Concurrent Scavenge Garbage Collection cycle is active and the source and destination memory regions for arraycopy overlap. This allows read and write to addresses beyond the end of the array range.
