Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `username` parameter of the `ajax.php` file within the House Rental Management System. The system does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper sanitization or parameterization of the `username` input before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application directly constructs SQL queries using user-provided input, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Sensitive user data and system information can be exposed by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **System Compromise:** The system's security can be severely compromised, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `username` parameter within an HTTP request to `ajax.php`.
*   **Direct SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL statements are directly inserted into the SQL query via the vulnerable `username` parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system to send the crafted HTTP request.
*   **Understanding of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `username` parameter in `ajax.php`

**Additional Details:**
*   The specific payload provided in the submission is `username=1'+AND+(SELECT+1234+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(13)))Iuab)+AND+'1'='1`. This payload is designed to trigger a time-based SQL injection, where the execution of the query is delayed to confirm the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects House Rental Management System version 1.0 and possibly earlier versions, as per the provided submission information.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by "SSL_Seven_Security Lab_WangZhiQiang_XiaoZiLong" and submitted to VulDB.

This information provides more detail than a typical CVE description, which often lacks specifics on the vulnerable parameter and includes a specific payload example for exploitation.
