# Negative command ACLs can be circumvented by abbreviating commands

High

[pstorz](/pstorz)
published
GHSA-jfww-q346-r2r8
Sep 10, 2024

## Package

bareos-director

## Affected versions

>= 23.0.0, < 23.0.4
>= 22.0.0, < 22.1.6
< 21.1.11

## Patched versions

23.0.4
22.1.6
21.1.11

## Description

### Impact

When a command ACL is in place and a user executes a command in bconsole using an abbreviation (i.e. "w" for "whoami") the ACL check did not apply to the full form (i.e. "whoami") but to the abbreviated form (i.e. "w"). If the command ACL is configured with negative ACL that should forbid using the "whoami" command, you could still use "w" or "who" as a command successfully.

Users of Bareos that use command ACLs with Bareos version 23 prior to 23.0.4, version 22 prior to 22.1.6, version 21 prior to 21.1.11 and any older version may be affected if command ACLs are used.

### Patches

Fixes for the problem are shipped in Bareos versions 23.0.4, 22.1.6 and 21.1.11.

### Workarounds

If only positive command ACLs are used without any negation, the problem does not occur.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
