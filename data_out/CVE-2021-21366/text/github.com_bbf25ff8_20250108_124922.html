### Fixes

* Avoid misinterpretation of malicious XML input - [`GHSA-h6q6-9hqw-rwfv`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/security/advisories/GHSA-h6q6-9hqw-rwfv) ([CVE-2021-21366](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h6q6-9hqw-rwfv "CVE-2021-21366"))
  + Improve error reporting; throw on duplicate attribute

    BREAKING CHANGE: It is currently not clear how to consistently deal with duplicate attributes, so it's also safer for our users to fail when detecting them.

    It's possible to configure the `DOMParser.errorHandler` before parsing, to handle those errors differently.

    To accomplish this and also be able to verify it in tests I needed to

    - create a new `Error` type `ParseError` and export it
    - Throw `ParseError` from `errorHandler.fatalError` and prevent those from being caught in `XMLReader`.
    - export `DOMHandler` constructor as `__DOMHandler`
  + Preserve quotes in DOCTYPE declaration

    Since the only purpose of parsing the DOCTYPE is to be able to restore it when serializing, we decided that it would be best to leave the parsed `publicId` and `systemId` as is, including any quotes.

    BREAKING CHANGE: If somebody relies on the actual unquoted values of those ids, they will need to take care of either single or double quotes and the right escaping.

    (Without this change this would not have been possible because the SAX parser already dropped the information about the quotes that have been used in the source.)
