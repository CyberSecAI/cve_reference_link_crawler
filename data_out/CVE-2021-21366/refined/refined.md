Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21366:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `xmldom` library's incorrect handling of system identifiers, Formal Public Identifiers (FPIs), and namespaces when parsing and serializing maliciously crafted XML documents. Specifically, the library does not preserve these elements correctly during repeated parsing and serialization cycles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of system identifiers
- Incorrect preservation of FPIs
- Incorrect preservation of namespaces

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing
- Potential for bugs and security holes in downstream applications
- Possibility of misinterpretation of malicious XML input

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted XML documents
- Repeated parsing and serialization of these documents

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide/inject malicious XML input to applications using the vulnerable library.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required for the attack to be successful beyond providing a malicious XML document.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in `xmldom` versions 0.4.0 and older.
- The fix for the vulnerability is included in version 0.5.0 and later.
- A similar vulnerability was reported in the Go standard library.
- The vulnerability has a moderate severity rating.
- The fix involves preserving quotes in DOCTYPE declarations and improving error handling.
- Duplicate attributes are now treated as an error.
- The library now throws a `ParseError` on parsing errors.
- Downstream applications can validate the input and reject maliciously crafted documents as a workaround.
- The fix also includes a breaking change where users relying on unquoted values of publicId and systemId will need to handle single or double quotes.
