The provided content discusses a penetration test performed by Deloitte Middle East Cybersecurity team on a client's subdomain hosting a third-party application (V-QRS). The testing revealed two vulnerabilities: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and SQL Injection.

**Root cause of vulnerabilities:**
*   **IDOR:** Failure to properly validate user access to resources. The application did not adequately enforce user permissions when accessing user profiles through a URL parameter (user ID).
*   **SQL Injection:** Lax input validation mechanisms allowed malicious SQL queries to be injected into input fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  The application allowed users to access other user profiles by manipulating the user ID parameter in the URL (e.g., changing `/user-profile/6/` to `/user-profile/1/`).
*   **SQL Injection:** The application did not properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **IDOR:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data including employee names, positions, personal phone numbers, email addresses, and potentially photos. This data could be used for phishing attacks, creating fake advertisements, overloading communication channels, and brute force attacks on login portals.
*   **SQL Injection:** Data leakage from the database, potentially including usernames, password hashes, and other sensitive information. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **IDOR:** Manipulating the user ID parameter in the URL.
*   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code into the user ID parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **IDOR:** The attacker needs to be able to make web requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to make web requests to the vulnerable application and use tools like SQLmap to inject malicious SQL code.
