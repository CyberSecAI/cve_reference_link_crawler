Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `delete_log.php` file of Tongda OA. It stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of the `DELETE_STR` argument passed to the `delete_log.php` file, which allows for SQL injection. The application constructs SQL commands using externally influenced input without neutralizing special elements.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even disrupt the availability of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, specifically targeting the `delete_log.php` file. The vulnerable parameter is `DELETE_STR`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the `delete_log.php` endpoint. No prior authentication may be required to reach the vulnerable component. The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
*   The vulnerability affects Tongda OA versions prior to 11.10.
*   The vendor was contacted but did not respond.
*   The vulnerability can be discovered using Google Hacking techniques (inurl:general/system/seal_manage/dianju/delete_log.php)
