The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "scm" open-source software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `uredi_Korisnika.php` file. User-supplied data is directly passed to `upis_u_bazu.php` without filtering.
- The `upis_u_bazu.php` file then inserts this unsanitized data into the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation.
- Direct use of POST request parameters without proper handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the database by entering it into the affected input fields.
- When other users view the data containing the malicious script, the script will execute in their browsers, leading to potentially malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Modifying displayed content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user input fields in the `uredi_Korisnika.php` file.
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields.
- The vulnerable code is in `uredi_Korisnika.php`, specifically lines 42-50, and in `upis_u_bazu.php`, lines 136-141.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `uredi_Korisnika.php` page and have the ability to submit a POST request with malicious JavaScript code in the input fields.
