  "summary": "CVE-2024-6222 is a vulnerability found in Docker Desktop that allows an attacker with access to the Docker Desktop VM via a container breakout to further escape to the host. This is achieved by passing malicious IPC messages related to extensions and the dashboard. The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.29.0.",
  "details": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause",
      "detail": "The root cause of the vulnerability is insecure handling of IPC messages between extensions and the dashboard, allowing a container breakout to escalate to a host escape."
    },
    {
      "type": "Vulnerability",
      "detail": "The primary vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization or validation of IPC messages exchanged between extensions and the dashboard within Docker Desktop. This allows for the possibility of crafted messages that can be exploited for malicious actions."
    },
     {
      "type": "Impact",
      "detail": "An attacker who has gained access to the Docker Desktop VM through a container breakout can further escape to the host, potentially leading to full system compromise."

      "type": "Attack vectors",
      "detail": "The attack vector involves a crafted malicious extension or manipulated IPC messages from a container to the Docker Desktop dashboard to execute arbitrary code on the host."

      "type": "Attacker capabilities",
      "detail": "The attacker needs to have already achieved a container breakout within the Docker Desktop VM to be able to exploit this vulnerability."
