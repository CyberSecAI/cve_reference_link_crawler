  "cve": "CVE-2024-1233",
  "description": "A flaw was found in `JwtValidator.resolvePublicKey` in JBoss EAP, where the validator checks jku and sends a HTTP request. During this process, no whitelisting or other filtering behavior is performed on the destination URL address, which may result in a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4",
     "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0"
    ],
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `JwtValidator.resolvePublicKey` function in JBoss EAP does not properly validate the destination URL obtained from the `jku` header of a JWT, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs. This can potentially be used to read local files, access internal network resources, or interact with external services, depending on the network configuration and permissions of the server. This could lead to information disclosure, unauthorized access, or other forms of remote attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted JWT containing a `jku` header pointing to a malicious URL. The server will make a HTTP request to this URL when validating the JWT.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a JWT. This can be done by having a compromised client, or by intercepting and manipulating an existing JWT. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the server, or have any special privileges on the server itself."
  },
  "patch": [
   "The vulnerability has been addressed in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4.17, and 8.0.2 releases, which includes bug fixes and enhancements.",
    "The fix involves adding validation or filtering behavior to the destination URL to prevent SSRF."
