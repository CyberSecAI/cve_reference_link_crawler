|  |  | It is strongly recommended that you use signed JWTs in order to guarantee authenticity of tokens and make sure they were not tampered. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [NOTE] |
|  |  | ==== |
|  |  | During JWT validation, if the `jku` header is present in a token, it must exactly match one of the values |
|  |  | from a configured string of allowed values or token validation will fail. The allowed `jku` values for a `token-realm` |
|  |  | can be specified as a space separated string using the `wildfly.elytron.jwt.allowed.jku.values.<realm-name>` system |
|  |  | property. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | As an example, to set the allowed `jku` values for the `JwtRealm` to `https://somehost.com` and `https://someotherhost.com`, |
|  |  | we'd need to set the `wildfly.elytron.jwt.allowed.jku.values.JwtRealm` system property to `"https://somehost.com https://someotherhost.com"`. |
