 Authentication

__________________________________________________________________

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2022:2
__________________________________________________________________

Advisory ID:       | SQUID-2022:2
Date:              | September 23, 2022
Summary:           | Buffer Over Read
                    | in SSPI and SMB Authentication
Affected versions: | Squid 2.5.STABLE1 -> 2.7.STABLE9
                    | Squid 3.x -> 3.5.28
                    | Squid 4.x -> 4.17
                    | Squid 5.x -> 5.6
Fixed in version:  | Squid 5.7
__________________________________________________________________

  <<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41318>>
__________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

  Due to an incorrect integer overflow protection Squid SSPI and
  SMB authentication helpers are vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow
  attack.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

  This problem allows a remote client to perform a Denial of
  Service attack when Squid is configured to use NTLM or Negotiate
  authentication with one of the vulnerable helpers.

  This problem allows a remote client to extract sensitive
  information from machine memory when Squid is configured to use
  NTLM or Negotiate authentication with one of the vulnerable
  helpers. The scope of this information includes user credentials
  in decrypted forms, and also arbitrary memory areas beyond Squid
  and the helper itself.

  This attack is limited to authentication helpers built using the
  libntlmauth library shipped by Squid.

CVSS Score of 8.2
<<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:C/MC:X/MI:L/MA:H&version=3.1>>
__________________________________________________________________

Updated Packages:

This bug is fixed by Squid version 5.7.

  In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
  releases can be found in our patch archives:

Squid 4:
  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/SQUID-2022_2.patch>>

Squid 5:
  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/changesets/SQUID-2022_2.patch>>

  If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
  to the package vendor for availability information on updated
  packages.

__________________________________________________________________

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

  Run this command to view the configured authentication helpers:

    (squid -k parse 2>&1) | grep "Processing: auth_param"

  Your Squid may be vulnerable if the result contains any of the following:
    ntlm_smb_lm_auth
    ntlm_sspi_auth
    ntlm_fake_auth
    negotiate_sspi_auth

  All Squid-2.5 up to and including 4.17 have vulnerable helpers.

  All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.6 have vulnerable helpers.

__________________________________________________________________

Workaround:

Either,

  Disable use of the vulnerable authentication scheme.

Or,

  Replace the vulnerable helper with an alternative helper for the
  same authentication scheme.

Or,

  Replace the vulnerable helper binary with one built from an
  updated or patched Squid release. The remainder of Squid does not
  need updating to fix this.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
