# SQUID-2022:2 Buffer Over Read in SSPI and SMB Authentication

High

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-394c-rr7q-6g78
Sep 23, 2022

## Package

squid\_ntlm\_auth, ntlm\_smb\_lm\_auth, negotiate\_sspi\_auth, ntlm\_sspi\_auth, ntlm\_fake\_auth
(Squid)

## Affected versions

2.5-5.6

## Patched versions

5.7

## Description

Due to an incorrect integer overflow protection Squid SSPI and

SMB authentication helpers are vulnerable to a Buffer Overflow

attack.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a remote client to perform a Denial of

Service attack when Squid is configured to use NTLM or Negotiate

authentication with one of the vulnerable helpers.

This problem allows a remote client to extract sensitive

information from machine memory when Squid is configured to use

NTLM or Negotiate authentication with one of the vulnerable

helpers. The scope of this information includes user credentials

in decrypted forms, and also arbitrary memory areas beyond Squid

and the helper itself.

This attack is limited to authentication helpers built using the

libntlmauth library shipped by Squid.

CVSS Score of 8.2

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:C/MC:X/MI:L/MA:H&version=3.1>

---

### Updated Packages:

This bug is fixed by Squid version 5.7.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 4:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/SQUID-2022_2.patch>

#### Squid 5:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2022_2.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

Run this command to view the configured authentication helpers:

(squid -k parse 2>&1) | grep "Processing: auth\_param"

Your Squid may be vulnerable if the result contains any of the following:

ntlm\_smb\_lm\_auth

ntlm\_sspi\_auth

ntlm\_fake\_auth

negotiate\_sspi\_auth

All Squid-2.5 up to and including 4.17 have vulnerable helpers.

All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.6 have vulnerable helpers.

---

### Workaround:

Either,

Disable use of the vulnerable authentication scheme.

Or,

Replace the vulnerable helper with an alternative helper for the

same authentication scheme.

Or,

Replace the vulnerable helper binary with one built from an

updated or patched Squid release. The remainder of Squid does not

need updating to fix this.

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

### Credits:

This vulnerability was discovered by LWIC.

Fixed by Amos Jeffries of Treehouse Networks Ltd,

based on patch by LWIC.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
