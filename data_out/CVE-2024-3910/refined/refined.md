Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromDhcpListClient` function of the Tenda AC500 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `fromDhcpListClient` function takes the `page` parameter from a POST request and directly uses it in a `sprintf` function.
- This `sprintf` copies the user-provided data into a local variable on the stack without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack.
- This can allow for arbitrary code execution, giving an attacker control over the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/DhcpListClient` endpoint.
- The `page` parameter in the POST request carries the overflow payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router.
- This likely requires the attacker to be on the same network or have network access to the router.
- No authentication details are mentioned in the provided context.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is AC500 V2.0.1.9(1307).
- A Proof-of-Concept (POC) exploit is provided using Python's `requests` library, demonstrating how to send a large payload in the `page` parameter to trigger the overflow.
