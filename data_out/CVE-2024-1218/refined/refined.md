Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least a contributor role.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected REST API endpoints.
