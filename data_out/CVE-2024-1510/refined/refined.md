Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1510:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `su_tooltip` shortcode of the "Shortcodes Ultimate" WordPress plugin. Specifically, user-supplied attributes and HTML tags within the shortcode are not properly sanitized, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious scripts injected via the `su_tooltip` shortcode are stored in the database and executed whenever a user accesses a page containing the crafted shortcode.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-provided attributes of the `su_tooltip` shortcode.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the output of the shortcode attributes when rendering the tooltip.
- **Unrestricted HTML tags:** The `reference_tag` attribute of the shortcode was not validated against allowed tags which allows to inject arbitrary HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser session when they visit a page containing the crafted shortcode.
- **Data Theft:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal user session data, cookies, and potentially sensitive information.
- **Account Takeover:** If an administrator or editor views a page with the malicious code, their session could be compromised and exploited to gain full access of the site.
- **Website Defacement/Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can alter the website's content or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious code via the `su_tooltip` shortcode.
- **WordPress Post/Page Content:** This can be done by crafting a malicious post or page containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with "Contributor" level or higher permissions to create or edit posts/pages and inject the vulnerable shortcode.
- **Access to Post/Page Editor:**  The attacker needs access to the post or page editor where they can insert the shortcode.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in the `tooltip.php` file of the plugin.
- The fix involves sanitizing the `reference_tag` attribute using `in_array` to check it against the global `$allowedposttags` and not using `sanitize_key()` on it to avoid removing the tag.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 7.0.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.0.3.
