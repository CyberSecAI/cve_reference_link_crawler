Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prompt injection flaw within the Vanna library's "ask" API. Specifically, the library uses a prompt to generate visualizations, and this prompt can be manipulated through user-controlled input. By injecting malicious instructions into the prompt, an attacker can bypass the intended visualization code and execute arbitrary Python code instead.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prompt Injection:** The core issue is that the library does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input before incorporating it into the prompt used for visualization generation.
- **Uncontrolled Code Execution:** Successful prompt injection leads to the execution of arbitrary Python code, effectively allowing an attacker to run commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system hosting the vulnerable Vanna instance. This gives them the ability to perform a wide range of malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, and denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **"ask" API with `visualize` Set to True:** The primary attack vector is through the `ask` method when the `visualize` argument is set to `True`, which is the default behavior. By crafting a malicious query passed to the `ask` function, an attacker can inject a prompt that will execute their code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input to the `ask` Function:** The attacker needs to be able to supply an input to the `ask` function of the Vanna library. Typically, this means the attacker has access to an application or service utilizing the Vanna library that allows them to control the input.
