Information Disclosure Vulnerability in MELSEC iQ-R Series
Safety CPU and SIL2 Process CPU Module

Release date: February 13, 2024
Last update date: May 16, 2024
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation

Overview

Information disclosure vulnerability due to Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-2661) exists in MELSEC iQ-R Series Safety CPU
and SIL2 Process CPU modules. After a remote attacker logs into the CPU module as a non-administrator user, the attacker may
disclose the credentials (user ID and password) of a user with a lower access level than the attacker by sending a specially crafted
packet. (CVE-2023-6815)

Mitigations

Mitsubishi  Electric  recommends  that  customers  take  the  following  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  the  risk  of  exploiting  this
vulnerability:
- Use a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.
- Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.
- Use IP filter function* to block access from untrusted hosts.

*: For details on the IP filter function, please refer to the following manual for each product.
"1.13 Security" - "IP filter" in the MELSEC iQ-R Ethernet User’s Manual(Application)

- Restrict physical access to the affected product as well as to the personal computers and the network devices that can communicate

with it.

- Install antivirus software on your personal computer that can access the affected product.
