The provided content describes a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `rsa_decrypt` function of the HTTPD binary in multiple ZTE routers. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2024-45413.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `rsa_decrypt` function decrypts RSA encrypted ciphertext and stores the result on the stack without checking its length, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow if the decrypted data exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) in the `rsa_decrypt` function.

**Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) as root.

**Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted RSA encrypted data to the vulnerable function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable API function.
