# Zip Slip Vulnerability in .a Static Library Files

High

[ajinabraham](/ajinabraham)
published
GHSA-4hh3-vj32-gr6j
Aug 18, 2024

## Package

pip

mobsf
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=4.0.6

## Patched versions

4.0.7

## Description

### Summary

Upon reviewing the MobSF source code, I identified a flaw in the Static Libraries analysis section. Specifically, during the extraction of .a extension files, the measure intended to prevent Zip Slip attacks is improperly implemented.

Since the implemented measure can be bypassed, the vulnerability allows an attacker to extract files to any desired location within the server running MobSF.

### Details

Upon examining lines 183-192 of the `mobsf/StaticAnalyzer/views/common/shared_func.py` file, it is observed that there is a mitigation against Zip Slip attacks implemented as `a.decode('utf-8', 'ignore').replace('../', '').replace('..\\', '')`. However, this measure can be bypassed using sequences like `....//....//....//`. Since the replace operation is not recursive, this sequence is transformed into `../../../` after the replace operation, allowing files to be written to upper directories.

For the proof of concept, I created an .a archive file that renders MobSF unusable by writing an empty file with the same name over the database located at `/home/mobsf/.MobSF/db.sqlite3`.

I am including the binary used for the POC named `poc.VULN`. To test it, you need to rename this binary to `poc.a`.

**Warning:** As soon as you scan this file with MobSF, the database will be deleted, rendering MobSF unusable.

PoC Binary File ([poc.VULN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K2eHYIZ1hUbs-Vi5zhKAKecnd0nDB8lO/view?usp=share_link))

### PoC

poc.mov

### Impact

When a malicious .a file is scanned with MobSF, a critical vulnerability is present as it allows files to be extracted to any location on the server where MobSF is running. In this POC, I deleted the database, but it is also possible to achieve RCE by overwriting binaries of certain tools or by overwriting the /etc/passwd file.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
