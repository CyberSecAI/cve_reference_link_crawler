Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the "One Click Close Comments" WordPress plugin utilizing a test file (`bootstrap.php`) with `display_errors` set to "on". This configuration exposes the full server path of the web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the web application's full server path due to the `display_errors` setting in a test file that is publicly accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The full path disclosure itself doesn't directly cause harm. However, it provides an attacker with valuable information about the server's file structure which can aid in reconnaissance and can facilitate other attacks.
- **Aid for Further Attacks**: The revealed path can be used to target specific files/directories on the system in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.
- **Direct Access to Test File:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable `bootstrap.php` file through a web request, triggering the display of the full path information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Position Required:** The attacker needs no special position or credentials. They only need to be able to send a request to the vulnerable file.
- **Basic web request capabilities:**  The attacker requires basic web request capabilities to retrieve the content of the vulnerable file.
