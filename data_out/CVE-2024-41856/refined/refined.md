Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2024-41856:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly validate input. This lack of validation can lead to unexpected behavior when processing maliciously crafted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the victim's machine, taking complete control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
*   No privileges are required (PR:N), the attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The user must be tricked into some form of action (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to entice the user to open a specially crafted file.
*   The attacker needs to have some method of local access to the target system.
