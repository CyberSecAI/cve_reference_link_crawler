```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Android Signing Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing permission check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with Item/Read permission, but without Item/Workspace or Item/Configure permission, can check whether attacker-specified file patterns match workspace contents. A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list workspace contents.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the plugin's form validation endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs Item/Read permission to the Jenkins instance.
