- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Privilege Management. A non-admin authenticated user can perform privilege escalation by tampering with the binaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management. The vulnerability exists in how the software handles user privileges, allowing a low-privileged user to gain higher privileges by modifying executable files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access, loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the workstation. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full access to the system, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. An authenticated non-administrator user must tamper with the binaries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with non-administrator privileges on the workstation where Vijeo Designer is installed. They need to be able to access the file system and modify binaries.
