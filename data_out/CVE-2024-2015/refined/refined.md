The provided content describes two distinct vulnerabilities in ZhiCMS:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `getindexdata` function in `app/index/controller/mcontroller.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user input. It allows the execution of multiple SQL statements by using `;` as a separator.
*   **Weaknesses:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `getindexdata` function.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data manipulation, information disclosure, and potentially complete compromise of the database. In this specific example, the provided exploit resets the administrator's password.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/index.php?r=index/m/getindexdata` with malicious SQL statements within the `key` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, with the ability to craft SQL queries.

**Vulnerability 2: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via PHP code concatenation**

*   **Root Cause:** The `index` function in `app/manage/controller/setcontroller.php` concatenates user-supplied input with PHP code and writes this to a file.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure concatenation of user-controlled data with PHP code, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Impact:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code and achieve remote code execution on the server, allowing for complete control of the application and the server it runs on.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/index.php?r=manage/set/index` with malicious PHP code embedded within the `sitename` parameter, closing PHP code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, with the ability to manipulate the `sitename` parameter to inject malicious PHP code and execute the resulting file. Additionally, the attacker would require knowledge of the file location.
