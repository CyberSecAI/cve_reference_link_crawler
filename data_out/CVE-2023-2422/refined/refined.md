  "CVE-2023-2422": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in Keycloak. A Keycloak server configured to support mTLS authentication for OAuth/OpenID clients does not properly verify the client certificate chain. A client that possesses a proper certificate can authorize itself as any other client, therefore, access data that belongs to other clients.",
    "root_cause": "Keycloak server does not properly verify the client certificate chain during mTLS authentication for OAuth/OpenID clients.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper certificate chain validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious client can impersonate other clients and access their data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A client with a valid certificate can impersonate another client."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs a valid certificate."
