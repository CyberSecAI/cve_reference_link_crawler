Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36159:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of weak, hard-coded cryptographic keys for user authentication in Contec FLEXLAN FXA2000 and FXA3000 series devices. Specifically, the `/etc/shadow` file contains easily crackable password hashes for both the `root` and `user` accounts.
*   The `root` account password cannot be changed by the device owner and is likely reserved for the manufacturer's maintenance purposes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The devices ship with a default `root` password hash that is the same across all devices. This constitutes a major security flaw as it allows attackers to gain privileged access to any device of this series once the password is recovered.
*   **Weak Cryptography:** The password hashes used in `/etc/shadow` are easily brute-forced, allowing attackers to quickly obtain the plaintext passwords.
*   **Backdoor Account:** The `root` account, with its unchangeable, hard-coded credentials, acts as a backdoor. The fact that only the `user` account's password can be changed via the web interface makes it clear that the root account is meant for Contec's purposes, not user administration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Access:** An attacker who recovers the `root` password gains complete administrative control over the device. This includes:
    *   Access to all system files.
    *   Ability to execute arbitrary commands as root.
    *   Ability to modify system configurations.
    *   Potential to install malware and establish persistent access.
*   **Network Compromise:** Since many devices share the same hard-coded `root` password, compromising one device could lead to the compromise of many devices on the same network or from same vendor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Once the attacker gains access to the admin interface (using the default credentials for the 'user' account), the attacker can then execute the telnetd script and use the obtained root password to open a telnet connection directly into the device.
*   **Brute-force Attack:** The attacker performs a brute-force attack on the password hashes.
*  **Physical Access**: While not explicitly stated, the hardcoded passwords mean an attacker with physical access to the device could potentially extract the password hash and crack it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to the Device:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device and be able to access the web management interface.
*   **Basic Networking Skills:**  The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of how to access the devices, execute commands via a hidden page, run a shell script and connect via telnet.
*   **Password Cracking Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to perform a brute-force password attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all Contec FLEXLAN FXA3000 series devices with firmware version 1.15.00 and under and all Contec FLEXLAN FXA2000 series devices with firmware version 1.38.00 and under.
*   The report highlights a clear lack of secure development practices, with passwords being shared across devices, which greatly increases the attack surface.
