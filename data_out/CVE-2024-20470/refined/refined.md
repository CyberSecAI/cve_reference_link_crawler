- Full system compromise is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, over the network.
- The attacker sends crafted HTTP input to the vulnerable web-based management interface.
- Exploitation can occur over the LAN, or the WAN if remote management is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs valid *admin* credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
