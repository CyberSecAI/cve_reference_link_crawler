  "cveId": "CVE-2024-27405",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The Linux kernel's Network Control Model (NCM) USB gadget function incorrectly handles extra bytes appended to Network Transfer Blocks (NTBs) by some USB hosts. Specifically, when tethering is used over NCM with Windows 11 as a host, a one-byte pad is sometimes appended to the end of a valid NTB, which the kernel's parsing logic incorrectly interprets as a separate, potentially corrupt, NTB. This leads to dropping all datagrams in the receive list (rx_list).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of data padding in NCM USB gadget function.",
      "Failure to handle unexpected extra bytes in the received data stream.",
      "Dropping of valid datagrams due to a parsing failure of potentially corrupted NTBs"
    ],
    "impact": "Data loss due to dropped datagrams in the NCM USB gadget function, leading to connection issues and reduced throughput.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Tethering over NCM with a Windows 11 host",
      "Specifically crafted USB packets from a malicious host"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker would need to control the behavior of a USB host to trigger the appending of extra bytes to the NTB. This is typical in a tethering scenario where the host controls data transmission. No particular elevated privileges are needed."
  },
  "patch": "The patch adds a check to determine if the extra byte is a zero pad, and if so, ignores it, rather than treating it as a separate NTB, thus preventing the dropping of valid datagrams."
