Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-23577:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element in ITE Tech consumer infrared drivers.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability exists due to an uncontrolled search path element in the ITE Tech consumer infrared drivers. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious files into the search path, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to an escalation of privilege, allowing an attacker to gain higher-level access to the system.
*   **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for exploitation and it requires an authenticated user.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system.
    *   User interaction is required.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to place malicious files in locations that are part of the uncontrolled search path.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected product is ITE Tech consumer infrared drivers before version 5.5.2.1 for Intel NUC.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.7 (Medium).
*   Intel recommends updating the ITE Tech consumer infrared drivers to version 5.5.2.1 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
