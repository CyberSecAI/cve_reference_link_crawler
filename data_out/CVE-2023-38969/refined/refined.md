Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Badaso application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding or editing book details. Specifically, the "Title of book" parameter is vulnerable to XSS injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code injected into the "Title of book" field is stored in the database and executed when the book details are displayed on other pages, such as when adding or editing a borrowing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
*   **Data Theft:** The injected script could potentially steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, user data, or authentication credentials.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions.
*  **Website Defacement:** Malicious scripts could alter the appearance of the website.
*   **Other Malicious Activities:** The attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of the Badaso application, specifically via the "Racks" and "Borrowing" sections.
*   **Input Field:** The specific attack vector is the "Title of book" input field when adding or editing a book.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Badaso application with sufficient permissions to access the "Racks" section.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker must know the specific input field that is vulnerable to the XSS attack.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The attacker must craft a malicious JavaScript payload.
