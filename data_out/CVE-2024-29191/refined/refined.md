Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2024-29191** is associated with a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in `links.html`.

*   **Root Cause:** The `links.html` page directly appends the `src` GET parameter into the HTML using `innerHTML` without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, DOM-based XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, potentially leading to malicious actions within the user's browser, such as stealing cookies or redirecting to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL containing the payload in the `src` parameter, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when a user visits the crafted link.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to entice a user to click on a specially crafted URL.

**CVE-2024-29192** is associated with a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in `index.html`.

*   **Root Cause:** The `index.html` page fetches data from an API and iterates over the stream names, directly inserting them into the HTML using `innerHTML`, without sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, DOM-based XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, potentially leading to malicious actions within the user's browser, such as stealing cookies or redirecting to malicious sites.
*  **Attack Vectors**: By creating a custom stream with a malicious name via the API, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when a user visits the index page. Additionally, a drive-by attack is possible via a malicious website.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to either manipulate the go2rtc instance directly by sending a PUT request to create a custom stream or trick a victim into visiting a malicious webpage that performs this action.

**CVE-2024-29193** is associated with a Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in `/api/config` leading to arbitrary command execution.

*   **Root Cause:** The `/api/config` endpoint lacks CSRF protection, allowing modification of the go2rtc configuration through requests from any origin, combined with the ability to execute arbitrary commands through a custom stream using the `exec` handler.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of CSRF protection, insecure command execution.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can modify the configuration to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can send a crafted `PATCH` request to the `/api/config` endpoint to add a malicious stream, restart the go2rtc server and then trigger the command execution via the newly added stream. This can be achieved by tricking a victim into visiting a malicious webpage.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious web page that executes the series of requests against the go2rtc server.
