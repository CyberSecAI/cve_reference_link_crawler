{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The commit introduces a fix to address an exception within the AES key scheduling instruction (aes64ks1i) within the Zkn extension of the Rocket Chip. The exception occurs if bits \[23:20] of the instruction are greater than 0xA.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of instruction bits during AES key scheduling within the Zkn cryptographic extension.",
       "Lack of sufficient input validation for the AES key scheduling instruction."
    ],
    "impact": "Without the fix, an illegal instruction exception can be triggered. This may lead to the program's execution being interrupted, denial of service, or other abnormal behaviors. Specifically, when `id_ctrl.zkn` (Zkn extension enabled) and the instruction is `ZKN.FN_AES_KS1`, if bits \[23:20] of the instruction are greater than 0xA, it should result in a illegal instruction exception. ",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation requires a malicious actor to execute crafted instructions to trigger the bug during AES key scheduling.",
      "The vulnerability exists within the Zkn extension of the Rocket Chip's processor architecture."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to execute instructions on a processor core that has the Zkn extension enabled. Knowledge of the architecture and instruction set is needed."
