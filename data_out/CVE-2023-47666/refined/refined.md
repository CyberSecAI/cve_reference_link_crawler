- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Code Snippets plugin versions 3.5.0 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact will vary depending on the context of the actions that can be triggered, but could include arbitrary code execution if an attacker can create or modify code snippets.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin. The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into making this crafted request by for example a link or other website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that the targeted user will execute. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the vulnerable website. The user must be logged into the targeted website.
