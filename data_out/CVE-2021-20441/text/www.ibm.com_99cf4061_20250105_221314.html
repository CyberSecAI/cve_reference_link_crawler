# Security Bulletin: IBM Security Verify Bridge uses relatively weak cryptographic algorithms in two of its functions (CVE-2021-20441)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

In two instances, IBM Security Verify Bridge (ISVB) uses a relatively weak cryptographic algorithm. (1) If no transport layer security (TLS) preference is specified, ISVB defaults to TLS 1.0 which has known vulnerabilities. (2) When generating a random number during LDAP bind authentication, ISVB chooses an older, less secure randomizer. As of v1.0.5, ISVB is now defaulting to TLS 1.2 and is using a cryptographically strong random number generator.
