- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Security Verify Bridge (ISVB) uses relatively weak cryptographic algorithms in two instances.
    1. If no Transport Layer Security (TLS) preference is specified, ISVB defaults to TLS 1.0, which has known vulnerabilities.
    2. When generating a random number during LDAP bind authentication, ISVB uses an older, less secure randomizer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of TLS 1.0 which has known vulnerabilities.
    - Use of a weak random number generator during LDAP bind authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The use of weak cryptography can lead to potential compromise of data and user credentials. TLS 1.0 is known to be vulnerable to various attacks, and weak random number generation can make authentication less secure.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited when ISVB is used in environments where TLS 1.0 is allowed or when performing LDAP bind authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic to exploit the TLS 1.0 vulnerability and would need to have access to the system where the LDAP authentication is taking place to exploit the weak random number generator.
