# November 2023 Security Bulletin

It is important to note that the issues included in this bulletin are a recent increase in scope of our disclosures, previously we focused on disclosing first-party, critical-severity vulnerabilities via critical advisories. **The high-severity vulnerabilities included in this bulletin have a lower impact from the critical advisories we have published previously.** While this change results in an increase of visibility and disclosures, it does not mean there are more vulnerabilities. Rather, that we are taking a more proactive approach to vulnerability transparency and are committed to providing our customers with the information they need to make informed decisions about updating our products.

The vulnerabilities reported in this security bulletin include 26 high-severity vulnerabilities which have been fixed in new versions of our products, released in the last month. These vulnerabilities are discovered via our Bug Bounty program and pen-testing processes, as well as third party library scans.
