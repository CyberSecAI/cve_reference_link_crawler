Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_12.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Friday, March 12, 2021

The Stable channel has been updated to 89.0.4389.90 for Windows, Mac and Linux which will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

A full list of changes in this build is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/89.0.4389.82..89.0.4389.90?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in switching release channels?  Find out how [here](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](https://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [5](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call%2Cchrome+label%3ARelease-2-M89) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$500][[1167357](https://crbug.com/1167357)] High CVE-2021-21191: Use after free in WebRTC. Reported by raven (@raid\_akame)  on 2021-01-15

[$TBD][[1181387](https://crbug.com/1181387)] High CVE-2021-21192: Heap buffer overflow in tab groups. Reported by Abdulrahman Alqabandi, Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research on 2021-02-23

[$TBD][[1186287](https://crbug.com/1186287)] High CVE-2021-21193: Use after free in Blink. Reported by Anonymous on 2021-03-09

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

Google is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2021-21193 exists in the wild.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[1187298](https://crbug.com/1187298)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).
