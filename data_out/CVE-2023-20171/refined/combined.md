To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must have valid credentials on an affected device.  For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-file-delete-read-PK5ghDDd>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco ISE.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  **Note**: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of the Cisco ISE system. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure the access restrictions, choose **Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access**.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20171: Cisco Identity Services Engine Arbitrary File Deletion Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary files on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains certain character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete specific files that their configured administrative level should not have access to.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd38138](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd38138)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20171Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N  **CVE-2023-20106: Cisco Identity Services Engine Authorization Bypass Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass the authorization mechanisms for specific file management functions.  This vulnerability is due to the lack of server-side validation of *Administrator* permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to either download or delete certain files that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid r*ead-only Administrator* credentials.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd63674](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd63674), [CSCwc86067](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc86067)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20106Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2023-20172: Cisco Identity Services Engine Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid *Administrator-*level privileges on the affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains certain character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files that their configured administrative level should not have access to.

Bug ID(s): [CSCwd93718](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd93718)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20172Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.9CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
