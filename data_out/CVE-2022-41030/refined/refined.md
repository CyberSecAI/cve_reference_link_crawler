{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer without proper size checks, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
   "Attack vectors": [
        "A specially-crafted network packet containing a malicious command can trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send a sequence of requests to trigger the vulnerable commands. Authenticated access is required (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H indicates 'High' Privileges Required)."
