CVE-2023-45686: Authenticated Remote Code Execution via WebDAV Path Traversal
Root cause of vulnerability: The WebDAV handler in Titan MFT does not properly validate the path specified by the user.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal vulnerability. The software doesn't sanitize user-supplied paths in WebDAV requests, allowing the user to write files outside of their designated home directory.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can write arbitrary files to any location on the file system, leading to remote code execution.

Attack vectors: An attacker sends a crafted PUT request to the WebDAV endpoint, with `../` sequences in the URL to bypass path restrictions.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs a valid user account for authentication, and WebDAV must be enabled (non-default configuration). The attacker must have network access to the WebDAV interface (port 8080 by default).
