Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is insufficient user input validation of the `sid` parameter in the `updatedata.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries because the parameter is used directly in SQL queries without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL injection vulnerability in `updatedata.php`.
*   Lack of input sanitization or validation.
*   Direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized database access.
*   Sensitive data leakage.
*   Data tampering (modification or deletion).
*   Potential for comprehensive system control.
*   Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to `updatedata.php` with a malicious payload in the `sid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `updatedata.php` file of the "Crud Operation System" V1.0.
*   The `sid` parameter is vulnerable to both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection.
*   Proof-of-concept (POC) payloads are provided for both types of blind SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability affects the `Pharmacy/Medical Store Point of Sale System Using PHP/MySQL and Bootstrap Framework with Source Code` project
*   The vendor homepage is `https://code-projects.org/crud-operation-system-in-php-with-source-code/`
