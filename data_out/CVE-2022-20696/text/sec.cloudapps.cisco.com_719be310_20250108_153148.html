| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco SD-WAN vManage Software Authentication Bypass Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2  First Published: 2021 May 5 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvi69876](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvi69876)     CVE-2021-1284     CWE-284       CVSS Score: [Base 8.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2021-1284     CWE-284       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2/csaf/cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the web-based messaging service interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass authentication and authorization and modify the configuration of an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to access an associated Cisco SD-WAN vEdge device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based messaging service interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated *read* and *write* access to the affected vManage system. With this access, the attacker could access information about the affected vManage system, modify the configuration of the system, or make configuration changes to devices that are managed by the system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:    + IOS XE SD-WAN Software   + SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software   + SD-WAN vEdge Cloud Routers   + SD-WAN vEdge Routers   + SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s).
