  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-20696",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the messaging server container ports on an affected system lack sufficient protection mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient protection mechanisms on messaging server container ports."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and inject messages into the messaging service, which can cause configuration changes or cause the system to reload.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker who has access to the VPN0 logical network can access the messaging service ports on an affected system by connecting to the messaging service ports."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to interfaces within the VPN0 logical network. This network may be restricted to protect logical or physical adjacent networks, depending on device deployment configuration."
