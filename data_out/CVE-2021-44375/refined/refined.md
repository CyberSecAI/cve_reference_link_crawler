The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2021-44375.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the improper input validation within the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. Specifically, the parser assumes that the `param` field within a JSON command will always be a JSON object. However, if a string or other non-object type is provided for the `param` field, the parser attempts to use the subscription operator (`[]`) on it, leading to an assertion failure and subsequent process termination.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The `cgiserver.cgi` does not validate the type of JSON data it receives for the `param` field, leading to an unexpected assertion failure.
- Denial of Service: By sending a crafted HTTP request with a non-object type `param`, an attacker can trigger an assertion, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the device to reboot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Successful exploitation results in a denial of service by causing the device to reboot. This disrupts normal operation of the security camera.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially-crafted HTTP POST requests with a JSON body to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint. The JSON body contains a command with a `param` field that is not an object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the device.
- The attacker may need a valid session token for some APIs, however, a separate vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420) can allow an attacker to bypass authentication.

**Specific details for CVE-2021-44375:**

*   **Vulnerable Command:** `SetOsd`
*   **Payload:**
```json
[
    {
        "cmd": "SetOsd",
        "action": 0,
        "param":  ""
    }
]
```
*   When this payload is sent to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint, the `SetOsd` parameter parser will receive `""` as the value of `param`. It will assume it is an object and attempt to access it using the subscription operator, which will result in an assertion failure, causing a crash and reboot.

This report provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description, including specific vulnerable commands, example payloads, and the specific code location where the assertion failure occurs.
