Based on the provided information, this document describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the TP-Link TL-WR941ND V6 router firmware.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `stringModify` function within the `/userRpm/popupSiteSurveyRpm.htm` URL. The `ssid` parameter from a POST request is copied into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Stack buffer overflow
  - Insufficient input validation
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - The stack overflow can be used to overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device. This can lead to full device compromise, allowing for data exfiltration, denial of service, or further attacks on the network.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Sending a crafted POST request to the `/userRpm/popupSiteSurveyRpm.htm` endpoint with an overly long `ssid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface (typically on the LAN).
  - The attacker must know the correct path for the vulnerable page
  - The attacker needs valid administrative credentials to make the request. The provided PoC includes the necessary authorization header.

The provided PoC shows an example of how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a long string to the `ssid` parameter. This document provides details that go beyond the CVE description by detailing the vulnerable function and providing proof of concept code.
