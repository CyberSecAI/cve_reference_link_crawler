# BT: Unchecked user input in bap\_broadcast\_assistant

Moderate

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-r8h3-64gp-wv7f
Sep 13, 2024

## Package

zephyr
(zephyr)

## Affected versions

<=3.6

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

In `parse_recv_state` in `subsys/bluetooth/audio/bap_broadcast_assistant.c`, the `recv_state->num_subgroups` in not verified, leading to stack overflow in subsequent for loop.

### Details

The function `parse_recv_state` is invoked from `read_recv_state_cb`, and its third parameter, `recv_state`, is defined as a local stack variable within `read_recv_state_cb`.

In `parse_recv_state`, the number of subgroups is determined by user input through the following line of code:

```
recv_state->num_subgroups = net_buf_simple_pull_u8(&buf);

```

This value is not validated and is directly used as the upper limit in a subsequent for loop. During the loop's execution, the `subgroup` can eventually exceed the bounds of the `recv_state` array, causing a stack overflow.

```
for (int i = 0; i < recv_state->num_subgroups; i++) {
	struct bt_bap_bass_subgroup *subgroup = &recv_state->subgroups[i];

```

The maximum number of subgroups should be restricted to a predefined configuration value, ensuring that user input does not exceed CONFIG\_BT\_BAP\_BASS\_MAX\_SUBGROUPS.

```
struct bt_bap_bass_subgroup subgroups[CONFIG_BT_BAP_BASS_MAX_SUBGROUPS];

```
### Impact

Result of exploitation could lead to instability (i.e., crash) or denial of service attacks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
