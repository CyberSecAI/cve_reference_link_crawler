### FAQ & Features

See below why WP STAGING is used on more than 195.000 websites.

###### Where is the staging site located?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

You can copy the staging site to a sub folder of your main site or to a complete custom path. It stays
entirely on your server and none of your data will be transfered to any third parties. You can clone the
production site to another database and even to the same database of the live site. In that case, all
staging site database tables will be prefixed by wpstg\_. This ensures that the live WordPress site never
interferes with the staging site.

###### Can a customer make changes, and the agency or the developer copy them to the production site?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

That's absolutely possible. Your client can modify plugins or posts and the admin can push over the
content by using the pushing function.

###### Is the staging site indexed by Google, any SEO issues?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

The staging site is not available to the public and needs authentication before it can be accessed. So
there are no possible SEO issues here.

###### Does WP Staging work on WordPress.com?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

WP STAGING can create backups and migrate WordPress.com sites to another website or server. However, staging sites on the same server are not possible due to WordPress.com's platform limitations. Instead, you can use the WP STAGING backup feature to set up a staging site on a different platform easily.

###### Can I push a staging site which has been created with the WP STAGING basic version?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

Yes, just install WP STAGING | PRO! The free version will be deactivated and the staging site will be
detected by WP STAGING | PRO automatically. Then you can push the existing staging site to the live site.

###### Do I need technical skills to use it?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

There is no special knowledge needed to create a staging site. Just click on a button and the entire job
will be done for you.

###### Can we push database selectively and skip WooCommerce transactions?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

You can push specific database tables only and can exclude WooCommerce tables to prevent overwriting of
these data on the production site. You can also push files only and omit database data. If you made
changes in the \_posts and \_postmeta table of your staging site you need to export new orders first and
import them to the staging site before doing the migration. [Read
more...](https://wp-staging.com/docs/skip-woocommerce-orders-and-products/)

###### Can I back up my production website with WP STAGING?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

Yes, you can back up all your sites with one click. You can select the entire site including the database or can differentiate between database, plugins, themes and media files.
WP STAGING uses a very advanced and intelligent way for exporting data and is often much faster and reliable than other backup plugins.

You are able to schedule and plan automatic backups and to transfer your backups to FTP and cloud services like
S3 compatible storage providers like Amazon S3, DigitalOcean Spaces or Wasabi, Dropbox, SFTP, Google Drive.

###### Can I upgrade from a 1-site license plan to a higher one?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

Sure, you can upgrade anytime, and you pay only the difference amount between the smaller and the higher
license.

###### GDPR & Privacy - Is data submitted to any 3rd parties like cloud servers?

![](https://wp-staging.com/wp-content/themes/wp-staging-theme/assets/images/icon-select.svg)

WP STAGING does not use any external servers and does not submit any of your data to third parties. The
complete cloning, migration and data processing is done on your servers only. Even we do not have access
to any of your data.

### Description

The WP STAGING Pro WordPress Backup Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'sub' parameter called from the WP STAGING WordPress Backup Plugin - Backup Duplicator & Migration plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include any local files that end in '-settings.php' via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
