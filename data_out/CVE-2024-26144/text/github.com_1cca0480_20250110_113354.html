# Possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage

High

[jhawthorn](/jhawthorn)
published
GHSA-8h22-8cf7-hq6g
Feb 26, 2024

## Package

bundler

rails
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 5.2.0, < 7.1.0

## Patched versions

7.0.8.1, 6.1.7.7

## Description

# Possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage

There is a possible sensitive session information leak in Active Storage. By

default, Active Storage sends a `Set-Cookie` header along with the user's

session cookie when serving blobs. It also sets `Cache-Control` to public.

Certain proxies may cache the Set-Cookie, leading to an information leak.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-26144](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8h22-8cf7-hq6g "CVE-2024-26144").

Versions Affected: >= 5.2.0, < 7.1.0

Not affected: < 5.2.0, > 7.1.0

Fixed Versions: 7.0.8.1, 6.1.7.7

## Impact

A proxy which chooses to caches this request can cause users to share

sessions. This may include a user receiving an attacker's session or vice

versa.

This was patched in 7.1.0 but not previously identified as a security

vulnerability.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the

workarounds immediately.

## Releases

The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

## Workarounds

Upgrade to Rails 7.1.X, or configure caching proxies not to cache the

Set-Cookie headers.
