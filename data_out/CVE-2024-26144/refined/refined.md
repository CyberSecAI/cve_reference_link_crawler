Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2024-26144:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Active Storage, a component of Ruby on Rails, sending a `Set-Cookie` header, which includes the user's session cookie, along with a `Cache-Control: public` header when serving blobs. This combination allows certain proxies to cache the `Set-Cookie` header along with the content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Session Information Leak:** The core issue is the potential for the session cookie to be cached by intermediary proxies due to the `Cache-Control: public` directive being set.
- **Improper Cache Control:** The default configuration of Active Storage doesn't prevent caching of the `Set-Cookie` header, which it should not be doing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Sharing:** If a proxy caches the response containing the session cookie, other users might receive this cached response, including the session cookie of another user.
- **User Impersonation:** An attacker could potentially obtain another user's session, leading to unauthorized access to their account.
- **Cross-User Access:** A user might end up with another user's session, gaining access to their data and privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Proxies:** Any proxy situated between the user and the server that respects caching and the `Cache-Control: public` directive can cache the sensitive `Set-Cookie` header. This includes CDNs and other intermediary caching servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Interception Point:** The attacker does not need to directly interact with the Rails application. They only need to be able to access a compromised proxy or be positioned to have their requests routed via a proxy that is caching session information. This means the attacker's actions are indirect.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of Rails >= 5.2.0 and < 7.1.0.
- It was fixed in versions 7.0.8.1 and 6.1.7.7.
- The fix involves disabling sessions for proxy controllers, preventing the `Set-Cookie` header from being sent.

**NetApp Products:**
According to the NetApp advisory, none of their products are currently affected by this vulnerability, with some products under investigation.

**Summary of Fix:**
The fix for this issue involves disabling sessions in ActiveStorage's proxy controllers, thus avoiding the inclusion of the `Set-Cookie` header in responses that are potentially cached by proxies.
