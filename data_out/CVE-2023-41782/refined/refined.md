- **Root cause of vulnerability**: DLL hijacking vulnerability. The application loads DLLs from predictable paths without proper validation, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL file in a directory where the application will load it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue, where the application doesn't properly validate the DLL path/location.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute malicious code on the system where the vulnerable application is installed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must place a malicious DLL file in a specific directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system to place the malicious DLL. User interaction is required for the application to load the malicious DLL.
