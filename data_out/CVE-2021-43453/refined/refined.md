The content relates to CVE-2021-43453.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a parsing error when encountering an unterminated `let` statement within a JavaScript program. Specifically, the parser fails to handle the case where a `let` statement is immediately followed by a class declaration without a closing brace or semicolon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The primary vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow that can be triggered by crafting a malicious JavaScript program with specific syntax, which lacks proper termination of `let` statements.
- Improper parsing: The root cause of the heap overflow is a parsing error within the JavaScript engine's parser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The crafted JavaScript code can cause a segmentation fault (crash) in the application, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential Remote Code Execution: With ASAN enabled the heap-buffer-overflow has been observed. This indicates the potential for more severe impacts like Remote Code Execution if further exploited.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JavaScript code: The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted JavaScript program containing an unterminated let statement followed by a class declaration to the vulnerable JavaScript engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code using the vulnerable JerryScript engine.
