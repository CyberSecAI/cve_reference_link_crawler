Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect default file access permissions (CWE-276) when multiple Mitsubishi Electric FA engineering software products are installed in a folder other than the default installation directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect file access permissions are set during installation when the software is not installed in the default directory.
- This allows unauthorized users to potentially gain access to the installation files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A malicious local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Execute malicious code
- Achieve information disclosure
- Tamper with or delete information
- Cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to run malicious code in the context of the affected software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the software is installed outside the default installation path.
- The vulnerability is present in a wide range of Mitsubishi Electric FA engineering software products and all versions of them.
- The vendor has stated they do not plan to release fixed versions, recommending workarounds instead.
- The provided CISA document confirms the vulnerability and provides additional mitigation recommendations.
- The JVN document also confirms the vulnerability and provides the same mitigation recommendation, as well as a CVSS v3 score of 9.3.
