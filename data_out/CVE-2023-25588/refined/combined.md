| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2167505#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-02-06 20:13:49 UTC  ``` In Binutils, the field `the_bfd` of `asymbol` is uninitialized in function `bfd_mach_o_get_synthetic_symtab`.  Upstream bug:  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29677>  Upstream fix:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=d12f8998d2d086f0a6606589e5aedb7147e6f2f1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2167505#c1)  Nick Clifton    2023-02-07 12:39:34 UTC  ``` This bug only affects binutils versions that have been configured to support the Mach-O file format.  This is not the case on binutils builds for Fedora or RHEL-9 and only affects the binutils builds for the s390x target on RHEL 8/7/6.  See [BZ 2167467](show_bug.cgi?id=2167467 "NEW - CVE-2023-25584 binutils: Out of bounds read in parse_module function in bfd/vms-alpha.c") for more details on why bugs in Mach-O support is restricted to these releases.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2167505#c5)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2023-03-01 17:35:29 UTC  ``` This does not affect gdb in RHEL or Fedora; gdb does not have or build the affected code.   ``` |  |

PR29677, Field `the\_bfd` of `asymbol` is uninitialised

Besides not initialising the\_bfd of synthetic symbols, counting

symbols when sizing didn't match symbols created if there were any

dynsyms named "".  We don't want synthetic symbols without names

anyway, so get rid of them.  Also, simplify and correct sanity checks.
