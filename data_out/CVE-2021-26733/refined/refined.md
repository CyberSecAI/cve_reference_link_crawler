**CVE-2021-26733: spx_restservice FirstReset_handler_func Broken Access Control**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `FirstReset_handler_func` function within the `spx_restservice`. This function handles a first reset operation, but lacks proper access control checks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is a broken access control mechanism. The function doesn't verify the user's session or authorization before performing the reset action. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger the reset.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An unauthenticated attacker can trigger a reset of the device, disrupting its normal operation.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An unauthenticated attacker can send a malicious request to the affected endpoint `/api/FirstReset` to trigger the reset.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable BMC. No authentication or special user privileges are required.
