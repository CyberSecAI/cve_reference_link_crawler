Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-45320:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element within the Intel® VTune™ Profiler software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software does not properly control or validate the paths it searches for resources, which can lead to the loading of malicious or unintended files.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated local user could potentially achieve privilege escalation. This could allow the attacker to gain higher level access within the system or perform actions that are normally restricted to a system administrator.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access. An attacker needs to have access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system and have local access. The attack also requires user interaction because the CVSS vector includes UI:R.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Intel® VTune™ Profiler software versions prior to 2024.0.
*   Intel recommends updating to version 2024.0 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS Base Score is 6.7 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
