- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Stream plugin does not enforce proper authorization controls, allowing low-privileged users (subscribers) to create alerts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization leading to broken access control. Specifically, the plugin's alert creation functionality can be accessed by unauthorized users (subscribers).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with subscriber privileges can create alerts, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. Although the specific information that can be leaked is not detailed, it is implied it stems from the configuration of alerts available to the subscriber.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack through HTTP requests to the WordPress admin-ajax endpoint, specifically using the `save_new_alert` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have subscriber-level access to the WordPress site. They must also be able to craft HTTP POST requests and obtain a nonce, which is available via the site's admin-ajax endpoint.
