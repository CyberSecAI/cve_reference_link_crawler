On a system running ZFS 2.2.0, upgrade pools to enable the block cloning feature. 2. `emerge -1 dev-lang/go`, where Portage's TMPDIR is on ZFS. 3. After a successful install of Go, the files in `/usr/lib/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/compile` are corrupted.   I was able to reproduce with and without Portage's "native-extensions" feature. I was unable to reproduce after changing Portage's TMPDIR to another filesystem (such as tmpfs). Include any warning/errors/backtraces from the system logs |

| I'm also hit by this bug, happened after upgrade to ZFS 2.2.0. Mounting tmpfs on portage TMPDIR (build directory for go) solves the issue. Currently on kernel 6.5.9, originally happened on 6.5.7.  No idea if it's worth noting, but the remaining data in the files seems to be a repetition of the same base64 encoded data. Decoding it gave me nothing comprehensible. |

| After downgrading coreutils from 9.3 to 8.32, I am no longer able to reproduce this corruption. My understanding is 8.32 predates the switch to automatically using reflink?  No idea if it's worth noting, but the remaining data in the files seems to be a repetition of the same base64 encoded data. Decoding it gave me nothing comprehensible.  This is the Go BuildID.

| Had the same issue here... Upgraded from 2.1.13 to 2.2.0 last month right after it came out. I'm on Ubuntu and built the ZFS package from the 2.2.0 tag.  I am discovering random files that were being stored after the 2.2.0 upgrade have suffered silent corruption and either have repetitious data like [@thulle](https://github.com/thulle) reported or have large blocks of contiguous zeroes instead of the data that they should be filled with. I don't use or build `go` like the other posters.  `zpool scrub` reports no errors, `zpool status` reports no errors. Let me know if there is any other information needed. |

| [#11900 (comment)](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/11900#issuecomment-927568640) onwards is highly relevant. See also [#14753](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/14753) and [#11900](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/11900) as a whole.  It would be interesting to know if people here have all upgraded their pool for the new block cloning feature or if there's a mix here. |

| My understanding is that block cloning is enabled by default when upgrading to 2.2.0, but my not be getting used unless an application like `coreutils` is actually leveraging it.  Can people post the result of this:  `zpool get all tank | grep bclone`  (where `tank` is the name of their pool with the corruption) |

| My understanding is this: If the result is `0` for both `bcloneused` **and** `bclonesaved` then it's safe to say that you **don't** have silent corruption.  Any non-zero number for either field and you **may OR may not** have silent corruption. |

| Agreed, we don't know what we don't know, we need to:   1. Get a machine / test case to repro it **most** of the time (Ideally 100%). I think we're here already here with newer `coreutils` and building `go`. 2. Determine what we think is the bug and produce a patch 3. Patch the source, rerun the test(s), verify that this now happens 0% of the time   I don't know if there's a more robust way of figuring this out outside of that. And of course I'm handwaving 2 which could be a heavy lift. |

| I'd assume, not having looked, that it's something like copy\_file\_range isn't dirtying things so the thing that triggers a force txg sync on SEEK\_DATA/SEEK\_HOLE with a dirty thing isn't firing.  But as I'm somewhat occupied recovering from being badly ill at home, my time to test and debug this is rather finite, so I wouldn't assume I'll be doing that in a timely fashion. |

| I agree with [@rincebrain](https://github.com/rincebrain) on the rough theory. I did look, and landed on code I've looked at before while trying to get my head around corner cases in block cloning. I have been suspicious of it for a while now, and remain so.  When we start to clone a block, we indicate intent to modify the target dbuf by calling `dmu_buf_will_clone`, which is a special case that unwinds any changes on the dbuf, and then sets it to `DB_NOFILL`.  In `dmu.c`:  ``` void dmu_buf_will_clone(dmu_buf_t *db_fake, dmu_tx_t *tx) { 	dmu_buf_impl_t *db = (dmu_buf_impl_t *)db_fake;  	/* 	 * Block cloning: We are going to clone into this block, so undirty 	 * modifications done to this block so far in this txg. This includes 	 * writes and clones into this block. 	 */ 	mutex_enter(&db->db_mtx); 	VERIFY(!dbuf_undirty(db, tx)); 	ASSERT0P(dbuf_find_dirty_eq(db, tx->tx_txg)); 	if (db->db_buf != NULL) { 		arc_buf_destroy(db->db_buf, db); 		db->db_buf = NULL; 	} 	mutex_exit(&db->db_mtx);  	dmu_buf_will_not_fill(db_fake, tx); }  void dmu_buf_will_not_fill(dmu_buf_t *db_fake, dmu_tx_t *tx) { 	dmu_buf_impl_t *db = (dmu_buf_impl_t *)db_fake;  	mutex_enter(&db->db_mtx); 	db->db_state = DB_NOFILL; 	DTRACE_SET_STATE(db, "allocating NOFILL buffer"); 	mutex_exit(&db->db_mtx);  	dbuf_noread(db); 	(void) dbuf_dirty(db, tx); } ```  It seems there's a window there where the lock is down and the dbuf is not-dirty. That may be a place where a second thread can add a change to that block, which then gets trampled.  Unfortunately `dbuf_dirty` and `dbuf_undirty` are extremely complex, and the gap is tiny, and without a tight test case its gonna take me a lot of time to track this down, which I don't have at the moment[1](#user-content-fn-1-7becf6452cb8e02dd3593cda2403785a). So this is an unhelpful comment but maybe it gives someone else an idea of where to look. Footnotes  1. but you can [buy some of my time](https://klarasystems.com/support/zfs-support/) 😉 [↩](#user-content-fnref-1-7becf6452cb8e02dd3593cda2403785a) |

| I am curious if it is broken in the same way on FreeBSD. Has anyone managed to reproduce this with intentional reflink copies? From what I recall the implementer's main platform was FreeBSD.  Also some of these stack traces are blown assertions in the ZIL. Are we certain all of these are in regard to the BRT feature? I know a lot of the more recent optimizations with regard to ZIL messed with lock granularity, do we know that these things haven't happened with BRT not being leveraged? |

| Here is probably not the right place to debate whether the other bugs around the ZIL are or are not from BRT. At least in 15529, I only tagged the ones where it was explicitly the case that block cloning was happening.  I'm also not sure what you mean by "intentional reflink support" here - in both FreeBSD and Linux's case, they're calling a copy\_file\_range analogue that is going to reflink if it can and do a boring copy otherwise, nobody here is explicitly trying FICLONE, which has last I checked no analogue on FreeBSD at all. |

| By intentional I mean doing cp with a reflink argument, assuming the BSD variant of cp has it. I'd expect that by default it doesn't try to use it automatically like coreutils' --reflink=auto behavior. When something like make is copying things around with quickly generated build artifacts, I expect you're dealing with code that is likely to contend race conditions more than a file that's been stable on disk for a few seconds and is being copied once with the BRT backed clone feature. |

| Ah gotcha, so the benefits of the reduced syscall are there without requiring repeated userspace / kernelspace round trips, but the BRT based shortcut and space savings are prohibited behind that sysctl. Makes sense. I am curious if FICLONE is the issue here and copy\_file\_range worked just fine? |

| Since I have 1.42GB of possibly affected files I thought I'd check for stretches of zeroes in the other files to see if anything other than compiling go might have triggered this. The block cloning commit only seem to change zdb code regarding the ZIL, so I just want to verify that we have no way of dumping the BRT to check which files contain cloned blocks, right?  Currently dumping a list of all file blocks to check for multiple references to the same block. |

| Its not hard to dump, but also it doesn't really show what you want. Each entry is just the offset within a vdev (half a DVA), and the number of references to it. It doesn't know what a file is, nor even really what a block pointer is.  Probably the dumbest version is to extend the in-memory mini-BRT used in `zdb -b` to note the object in which cloned blocked were seen, and then dump those out at the end. It does mean a full scan though (about the same heft as a scrub).  Hmm, now I think about it, it might not help anyway. If the problem is that there was a race, and we applied a change in the wrong order, such that zeroes got written, then the clone itself was never performed - we did a real write, just with zero content. So there's no clone to look for. |

To add to [@classabbyamp](https://github.com/classabbyamp) answer, any software (besides coreutils) which tries to find holes in files it is both reading and writing at the same time is potentially affected. However, the potential timing window is so small and the access pattern so specific that the likelihood of actually tripping on this bug is rather small. |

| In that case, would zfs send/recv be affected and would rsync be affected? Or would that only really be the case if coreutils 9.x is present?  I did find some ppas I could look into like ppa:arter97/zfs and ppa:patrickdk/zfs and ppa:ofthesun/zfs at least so I can probably patch my Ubuntu systems, but I have a feeling patching my Proxmox systems may require me learning how to build zfs from source, although I did find kneutron/ansitest has a couple zfs build scripts so maybe that will help me learn building zfs from source.  Thanks for all the additional information, it's quite interesting learning about this bug even though it's been patched already.  Edit: Sounds like there's a newer Proxmox with this bug already fixed/backported so that's good at least.  Edit 2: I have gone with ppa:arter97/zfs and upgraded my Ubuntu systems to zfs 2.2.2 and upgraded my Proxmox systems to Proxmox 8.1 which supposedly includes the zfs fix backported to 2.2.0, so I suppose all is well for me now. |

    toradex_apalis_imx6_defconfig: add download hashes for linux/uboot

    The defconfig fetches Linux and U-Boot from a git repo using the
    unauthenticated git:// protocol, so add download hashes for them to ensure
    we get the right sources by adding a global patch dir and running
    utils/add-custom-hashes.

    The defconfig uses the Linux sources for the kernel headers, so make
    linux-headers/linux-headers.hash a symlink to linux/linux.hash so the same
    hash file is used.

    package/libpjsip: security bump to version 2.14

    Fix CVE-2023-38703: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia
    communication library written in C with high level API in C, C++, Java,
    C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a higher level media transport which
    is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE.
    Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower
    level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This
    vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability
    (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other
    than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from unexpected
    application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The
    patch is available as a commit in the master branch.

    package/erlang: disable for uclibc, fix glibc-build

    Commit 2cfa86a54882(package/erlang: bump version to 26.0.2) added a
    patch to restore building on uClibc.

    However, that patch is not upstream, and has been rejected:

        https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/7500

        Please open a PR to https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit instead and we
        will get the fix next time we sync with upstream. We do not want
        theirs and our implementation to diverge.

    Furthermore, it happens to work on uClibc, because uClibc does not
    expose sys/auxv.h, but it fails to work on glibc, because the define is
    not propagated to \"sub-trees\", and thus is never defined where it is
    checked for, even when sys/auxv.h is available. This causes build
    failures such as:

        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp: In function ‘void asmjit::_abi_1_10::detectHWCaps(CpuInfo&, long unsigned int, const LinuxHWCapMapping*, size_t)’:
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:840:24: error: ‘getauxval’ was not declared in this scope
          840 |   unsigned long mask = getauxval(type);
              |                        ^~~~~~~~~
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp: In function ‘void asmjit::_abi_1_10::detectARMCpu(CpuInfo&)’:
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:972:21: error: ‘AT_HWCAP’ was not declared in this scope
          972 |   detectHWCaps(cpu, AT_HWCAP, hwCapMapping, ASMJIT_ARRAY_SIZE(hwCapMapping));
              |                     ^~~~~~~~
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:973:21: error: ‘AT_HWCAP2’ was not declared in this scope
          973 |   detectHWCaps(cpu, AT_HWCAP2, hwCapMapping2, ASMJIT_ARRAY_SIZE(hwCapMapping2));
              |                     ^~~~~~~~~

    Yet, sys/auxv.h was detected at configure time:

        checking for sys/auxv.h... yes

    This defconfig is enough to reproduce the error:

        BR2_aarch64=y
        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL=y
        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL_BOOTLIN=y
        BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG=y

    Since upstream refused the patch, and there is no fix that was submitted
    to the actual upstream (asmjit), drop the rejectred patch, and disable
    for uClibc: the patch is incorrect, and we can't fix a build issue on
    uClibc by introducing another on glibc.

    package/libxml2: security bump to version 2.11.6

    Fix CVE-2023-45322: libxml2 through 2.11.5 has a use-after-free that can
    only occur after a certain memory allocation fails. This occurs in
    xmlUnlinkNode in tree.c. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"I don't think
    these issues are critical enough to warrant a CVE ID ... because an
    attacker typically can't control when memory allocations fail.\"

    board/raspberrypi: fix autoprobing of bluetooth driver

    The commit 689b9ac439 (package/rpi-firmware: rework boot/config file
    handling) has split in two the property:

    	dtoverlay=miniuart-bt,krnbt=on

    Into:

    	dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
    	dtoverlay=krnbt=on

    The initial property contained the dtbo file miniuart-bt[1] and its
    parameter krnbt=on[2][3].

    The first syntax is correct while the second is not. The krnbt=on is not
    a dtoverlay[4] but a dtparam[5]. Therefore the property dtparam must be
    used instead.

    package/netsnmp: revert back to 5.9.3, backport security fix

    In commit 13fc9dcb34926e9b6310b23662920c55c96d83a1, netsnmp was bumped
    from 5.9.3 to 5.9.4 to fix two CVEs.

    However, even though it's a minor version bump, there are actually 163
    commits upstream between those two minor releases, and some of them
    are breaking existing use-cases. In particular upstream
    a2cb167514ac0c7e1b04e8f151e0b015501362e0 now requires that config_()
    macros in MIB files are terminated with a semicolon, causing a build
    breakage with existing MIB files that were totally valid with 5.9.3.

    This commit therefore proposes to revert back to 5.9.3, by reverting
    those two commits:

    56caafceab3ec12669ccb7aa6fc8b653778064e1 package/netsnmp: fix musl build
    13fc9dcb34926e9b6310b23662920c55c96d83a1 package/netsnmp: security bump to version 5.9.4

    and instead backport the one upstream commit that fixes both CVEs.

    package/zfs: fix zfs autotools cross-compilation

    This commit addresses a long-standing bug encountered during ZFS
    compilation in cross-platform environments. The issue arises because ZFS
    autoconf triggers a `make modules` to detect if the kernel can compile
    modules [1]. The problem occurs when autoconf uses the host environment
    instead of the cross-platform environment.

    To fix this, we export necessary environment variables to ensure that ZFS
    autoconf utilizes the cross-platform environment correctly.

    This patch resolves ZFS cross-platform compilations:

    package/zfs: don't download patch generated from github

    Git-generated patches embed the short-hash of the objects in the
    repository. The length of those short hashes are subject to change
    in at least three cases:

      - the number of objects in the repository increases, so git increases
        the length of short hashes to get a good change there is no
        collision;

      - the git configuration changes, see core.abbrev in git-config;

      - the heuristic to compute the length changes in a newer git version.

    Since the bump to zfs 2.1.4 in commit 68dfd09708c6, the patch generated
    by github has changed, causing download failures:

    And indeed, the length of short hashes has increased by one since then.

    Fix that by bundling the patch, with the short hashes that were known
    then, so that it matches the sha256 we had for it.

    package/gcc: fix disabling the documentation

    gcc.mk attempts to disable building the documentation by setting
    MAKEINFO=missing, but it is not working.  If makeinfo is installed
    and recent enough, gcc still uses it.  This can be checked easily:

    grep BUILD_INFO='info' host-gcc-initial-*/build/gcc/config.log

    It happens because the root ./configure script will check
    $MAKEINFO --version (aka 'missing --version') and will overwrite it with
    MAKEINFO='missing makeinfo' because the version does not match.

    Having MAKEINFO='missing makeinfo' is a problem because
    'missing makeinfo' will actually attempt to run 'makeinfo' before
    failing with an error message.  If makeinfo is installed on the host,
    then 'missing makeinfo' will successfully run makeinfo anyway.

    Many gcc subprojects will check $MAKEINFO --version and enable building
    the documentation if it is recent enough.  This patch overrides these
    checks by forcing gcc_cv_prog_makeinfo_modern=no.

    Building the GCC documentation can fail with the wrong makeinfo version.
    It happened at least when building GCC 11.3.0 with makeinfo 7.1.

    toradex_apalis_imx6_defconfig: add download hashes for linux/uboot

    The defconfig fetches Linux and U-Boot from a git repo using the
    unauthenticated git:// protocol, so add download hashes for them to ensure
    we get the right sources by adding a global patch dir and running
    utils/add-custom-hashes.

    The defconfig uses the Linux sources for the kernel headers, so make
    linux-headers/linux-headers.hash a symlink to linux/linux.hash so the same
    hash file is used.

    package/libpjsip: security bump to version 2.14

    Fix CVE-2023-38703: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia
    communication library written in C with high level API in C, C++, Java,
    C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a higher level media transport which
    is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE.
    Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower
    level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This
    vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability
    (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other
    than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from unexpected
    application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The
    patch is available as a commit in the master branch.

    package/gsl: fix musl build on m68k

    Update patch to fix the following musl build failure with m68k which is
    only raised (for an unknown reason) since bump to version 2.7.1 in commit
    [3e48f83](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/3e48f8358e519f9c24262a6549d8f6c78ee01add):

    package/erlang: disable for uclibc, fix glibc-build

    Commit [2cfa86a](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/2cfa86a54882f2831b36a78a0ca642aa3a4bd0a4)(package/erlang: bump version to 26.0.2) added a
    patch to restore building on uClibc.

    However, that patch is not upstream, and has been rejected:

        [erlang/otp#7500](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/7500)

        Please open a PR to <https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit> instead and we
        will get the fix next time we sync with upstream. We do not want
        theirs and our implementation to diverge.

    Furthermore, it happens to work on uClibc, because uClibc does not
    expose sys/auxv.h, but it fails to work on glibc, because the define is
    not propagated to "sub-trees", and thus is never defined where it is
    checked for, even when sys/auxv.h is available. This causes build
    failures such as:

        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp: In function ‘void asmjit::_abi_1_10::detectHWCaps(CpuInfo&, long unsigned int, const LinuxHWCapMapping*, size_t)’:
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:840:24: error: ‘getauxval’ was not declared in this scope
          840 |   unsigned long mask = getauxval(type);
              |                        ^~~~~~~~~
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp: In function ‘void asmjit::_abi_1_10::detectARMCpu(CpuInfo&)’:
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:972:21: error: ‘AT_HWCAP’ was not declared in this scope
          972 |   detectHWCaps(cpu, AT_HWCAP, hwCapMapping, ASMJIT_ARRAY_SIZE(hwCapMapping));
              |                     ^~~~~~~~
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:973:21: error: ‘AT_HWCAP2’ was not declared in this scope
          973 |   detectHWCaps(cpu, AT_HWCAP2, hwCapMapping2, ASMJIT_ARRAY_SIZE(hwCapMapping2));
              |                     ^~~~~~~~~

    Yet, sys/auxv.h was detected at configure time:

        checking for sys/auxv.h... yes

    This defconfig is enough to reproduce the error:

        BR2_aarch64=y
        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL=y
        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL_BOOTLIN=y
        BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG=y

    Since upstream refused the patch, and there is no fix that was submitted
    to the actual upstream (asmjit), drop the rejectred patch, and disable
    for uClibc: the patch is incorrect, and we can't fix a build issue on
    uClibc by introducing another on glibc.

    package/libxml2: security bump to version 2.11.6

    Fix [CVE-2023-45322](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqpg-m25j-7558 "CVE-2023-45322"): libxml2 through 2.11.5 has a use-after-free that can
    only occur after a certain memory allocation fails. This occurs in
    xmlUnlinkNode in tree.c. NOTE: the vendor's position is "I don't think
    these issues are critical enough to warrant a CVE ID ... because an
    attacker typically can't control when memory allocations fail."

    docs/website: fix favicon

    When the favicon image was added in [f26e613](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/f26e61319f3f9ba0bfed214197480e70a2058791) (docs/website: add
    favicon.png), it was added to a different directory then where the header's
    icon link points. This causes the favicon to fail to load with 404.

    While we are here, remove the "shortcut" rel attribute as it is non-standard
    and it's recommended not to use it[1].

    board/raspberrypi: fix autoprobing of bluetooth driver

    The commit [689b9ac](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/689b9ac439ab7b507c8982b6102bddf59d03efbf) (package/rpi-firmware: rework boot/config file
    handling) has split in two the property:

    	dtoverlay=miniuart-bt,krnbt=on

    Into:

    	dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
    	dtoverlay=krnbt=on

    The initial property contained the dtbo file miniuart-bt[1] and its
    parameter krnbt=on[2][3].

    The first syntax is correct while the second is not. The krnbt=on is not
    a dtoverlay[4] but a dtparam[5]. Therefore the property dtparam must be
    used instead.

    This fixes:

    	# cat /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/chosen/user-warnings
    	Failed to load overlay 'krnbt=on'

    package/netsnmp: revert back to 5.9.3, backport security fix

    In commit [13fc9dc](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/13fc9dcb34926e9b6310b23662920c55c96d83a1), netsnmp was bumped
    from 5.9.3 to 5.9.4 to fix two CVEs.

    However, even though it's a minor version bump, there are actually 163
    commits upstream between those two minor releases, and some of them
    are breaking existing use-cases. In particular upstream
    a2cb167514ac0c7e1b04e8f151e0b015501362e0 now requires that config_()
    macros in MIB files are terminated with a semicolon, causing a build
    breakage with existing MIB files that were totally valid with 5.9.3.

    This commit therefore proposes to revert back to 5.9.3, by reverting
    those two commits:

    [56caafc](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/56caafceab3ec12669ccb7aa6fc8b653778064e1) package/netsnmp: fix musl build

    and instead backport the one upstream commit that fixes both CVEs.

    package/zfs: fix zfs autotools cross-compilation

    This commit addresses a long-standing bug encountered during ZFS
    compilation in cross-platform environments. The issue arises because ZFS
    autoconf triggers a `make modules` to detect if the kernel can compile
    modules [1]. The problem occurs when autoconf uses the host environment
    instead of the cross-platform environment.

    To fix this, we export necessary environment variables to ensure that ZFS
    autoconf utilizes the cross-platform environment correctly.

    This patch resolves ZFS cross-platform compilations:

    package/zfs: don't download patch generated from github

    Git-generated patches embed the short-hash of the objects in the
    repository. The length of those short hashes are subject to change
    in at least three cases:

      - the number of objects in the repository increases, so git increases
        the length of short hashes to get a good change there is no
        collision;

      - the git configuration changes, see core.abbrev in git-config;

      - the heuristic to compute the length changes in a newer git version.

    Since the bump to zfs 2.1.4 in commit [68dfd09](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/68dfd09708c66f1aeca3bf5725eb83c7ea5b35c8), the patch generated

    And indeed, the length of short hashes has increased by one since then.

    Fix that by bundling the patch, with the short hashes that were known
    then, so that it matches the sha256 we had for it.

    package/gcc: fix disabling the documentation

    gcc.mk attempts to disable building the documentation by setting
    MAKEINFO=missing, but it is not working.  If makeinfo is installed
    and recent enough, gcc still uses it.  This can be checked easily:

    grep BUILD_INFO='info' host-gcc-initial-*/build/gcc/config.log

    It happens because the root ./configure script will check
    $MAKEINFO --version (aka 'missing --version') and will overwrite it with
    MAKEINFO='missing makeinfo' because the version does not match.

    Having MAKEINFO='missing makeinfo' is a problem because
    'missing makeinfo' will actually attempt to run 'makeinfo' before
    failing with an error message.  If makeinfo is installed on the host,
    then 'missing makeinfo' will successfully run makeinfo anyway.

    Many gcc subprojects will check $MAKEINFO --version and enable building
    the documentation if it is recent enough.  This patch overrides these
    checks by forcing gcc_cv_prog_makeinfo_modern=no.

    Building the GCC documentation can fail with the wrong makeinfo version.

| I have been testing this, using this command: `parallel --lb --halt-on-error now,fail=1 ./zhammer.sh /data 10000000 16k 10000 ::: $(seq $(nproc))`  I haven't been able to replicate this issue using zhammer on a PC running Ubuntu 22.04 with kernel 6.2.0-37-generic, zfs-2.1.6-0york1~22.04, and zfs-kmod-2.1.9-2ubuntu1.1.  I also haven't been able to replicate it using zhammer on another PC running Proxmox pve-manager/7.4-17/513c62be (running kernel: 5.15.131-1-pve) with zfs-2.1.11-pve1 and zfs-kmod-2.1.11-pve1.  I thought that this issue definitely affected version 2.1.11 and above, and possibly even earlier versions (like the 2.1.6/2.1.9 I am running on my other PC) - or am I mistaken and this is not the case?  Same thing here.  I am using Proxmox 7.4-3 with coreutils version 8.32-4+b1 and zfsutils-linux: 2.1.11-pve1 and zfs-2.1.11-pve1 and zfs-kmod-2.1.11-pve1 and I've tested 640 million files (64 threads \* 10 million files/thread) and haven't been able to replicate the issue on my end neither.  When I check my Solaris 10 1/13 system, GNU coreutils is NOT installed by default.  As far as I can so, it looks like (until I can find information otherwise, or someone else can educate me) that the core software libraries used for system administration is installed under the Solaris package SUNWadmc, so I am guessing that that's where the tool `cp` for Solaris comes through (rather than through GNU coreutils).  This should suggest that the probability of there being an issue with Solaris ZFS for this specific issue, should be relatively rather low, given that as far as I can tell, it doesn't use the same method to copy files as GNU coreutils `cp` does -- but again, I can be wrong.  Thanks. |

If the bug is present in that version of ZFS, then it should theoretically be possible to trigger with anything that seeks to the next hole in a file, regardless of what that program may be. If coreutils 9.x can build for solaris, then that could be a way to try to reproduce the bug. Even a minimal program that just does the equivalent to coreutils `cp` would be enough. |

Over its history this the dirty dnode test has been changed between
checking for a dnodes being on `os_dirty_dnodes` (`dn_dirty_link`) and
`dn_dirty_record`.

  66aca2473 SEEK_HOLE should not block on txg_wait_synced()

Also illumos/illumos-gate@c543ec060d illumos/illumos-gate@2bcf0248e9

It turns out both are actually required.

In the case of appending data to a newly created file, the dnode proper
is dirtied (at least to change the blocksize) and dirty records are
added.  Thus, a single logical operation is represented by separate
dirty indicators, and must not be separated.

The incorrect dirty check becomes a problem when the first block of a
file is being appended to while another process is calling lseek to skip
holes. There is a small window where the dnode part is undirtied while
there are still dirty records. In this case, `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_DATA)`
would not know that the file is dirty, and would go to
`dnode_next_offset()`. Since the object has no data blocks yet, it
returns `ESRCH`, indicating no data found, which results in `ENXIO`
being returned to `lseek()`'s caller.

Since coreutils 9.2, `cp` performs sparse copies by default, that is, it
uses `SEEK_DATA` and `SEEK_HOLE` against the source file and attempts to
replicate the holes in the target. When it hits the bug, its initial
search for data fails, and it goes on to call `fallocate()` to create a
hole over the entire destination file.

This has come up more recently as users upgrade their systems, getting
OpenZFS 2.2 as well as a newer coreutils. However, this problem has been
reproduced against 2.1, as well as on FreeBSD 13 and 14.

This change simply updates the dirty check to check both types of dirty.
If there's anything dirty at all, we immediately go to the \"wait for
sync\" stage, It doesn't really matter after that; both changes are on
disk, so the dirty fields should be correct.

Previously, dmu_buf_will_clone() would roll back any dirty record, but
would not clean out the modified data nor reset the state before
releasing the lock. That leaves the last-written data in db_data, but
the dbuf in the wrong state.

This is eventually corrected when the dbuf state is made NOFILL, and
dbuf_noread() called (which clears out the old data), but at this point
its too late, because the lock was already dropped with that invalid
state.

Any caller acquiring the lock before the call into
dmu_buf_will_not_fill() can find what appears to be a clean, readable
buffer, and would take the wrong state from it: it should be getting the
data from the cloned block, not from earlier (unwritten) dirty data.

Even after the state was switched to NOFILL, the old data was still not
cleaned out until dbuf_noread(), which is another gap for a caller to
take the lock and read the wrong data.

This commit fixes all this by properly cleaning up the previous state
and then setting the new state before dropping the lock. The
DBUF_VERIFY() calls confirm that the dbuf is in a valid state when the
lock is down.

| I found out why second copy from my comment [#15526 (comment)](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1830827761) is done by seeking hole/data:  ZFS reports number of blocks that is less than size of file thats why second copy is sparse but it shouldn't. Of course it whouldn't be good for reproducer but the real question:  Do we have another bug in zfs in reporting number of blocks ?  BEcause of that cp doesn't to copy\_file\_Range as it should and perform faster :) For me it should report real number of blocks. |

As a mitigation until more is understood and fixes are tested & reviewed, change
the default of zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync from 1 to 0, as it was before
05b3eb6d232009db247882a39d518e7282630753 upstream.

There are no reported cases of The Bug being hit with zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync=1:
that does not mean this is a cure or a real fix, but it _appears_ to be at least
effective in reducing the chances of it happening. By itself, it's a safe change
anyway, so it feels worth us doing while we wait.

Note that The Bug has been reproduced on 2.1.x as well, hence we do it for both
2.1.13 and 2.2.1.

`[02fdf2e](/gentoo-mirror/linux-be/commit/02fdf2eca358def32b52f4dbdeb56b176a5941c4)`

```
As a mitigation until more is understood and fixes are tested & reviewed, change
the default of zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync from 1 to 0, as it was before
05b3eb6d232009db247882a39d518e7282630753 upstream.

There are no reported cases of The Bug being hit with zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync=1:
that does not mean this is a cure or a real fix, but it _appears_ to be at least
effective in reducing the chances of it happening. By itself, it's a safe change
anyway, so it feels worth us doing while we wait.

Note that The Bug has been reproduced on 2.1.x as well, hence we do it for both
2.1.13 and 2.2.1.

| We're still hitting this bug in 2.2.3 and it hasn't been fully fixed yet. I found this issue here, more people are still experiencing it: [#15933](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15933)  Just wanted to keep people aware and to keep checking your data for silent corruption. |
