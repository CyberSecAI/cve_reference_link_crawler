#### Supported Platforms

* **Linux**: compatible with 3.10 - 6.5 kernels
* **FreeBSD**: compatible with releases starting from 12.2-RELEASE

#### Changes

**Note**: This release contains an important fix for a data corruption bug. Full details are in the issue ([#15526](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526)) and bug fix ([#15571](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571)). There's also a developer's [bug summary](https://gist.github.com/rincebrain/e23b4a39aba3fadc04db18574d30dc73) that gives a good overview. We recommend everyone either upgrade to 2.2.2 or 2.1.14 to get the fix. The bug can cause data corruption due to an incorrect dirty dnode check. This bug is very hard to hit, and really only came to light due to changes in `cp` in coreutils 9.x. It's extremely unlikely that the bug was ever hit on EL7 or EL8 when running `cp` since they all use coreutils 8.x which performs file copies differently.

*Updated (12/1/23):*

EL9 was previously vulnerable since it uses coreutils 8.32 with the SEEK\_DATA/SEEK\_HOLE patches backported from coreutils 9.x.

* copy-builtin: add hooks with sed/>> [#13316](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/13316)
* Zpool can start allocating from metaslab before TRIMs have completed [#15395](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15395)
* dnode\_is\_dirty: check dnode and its data for dirtiness [#15571](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571) [#15526](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526)
