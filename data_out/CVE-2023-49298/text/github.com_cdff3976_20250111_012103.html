### @robn **[robn](/robn)** commented [Nov 24, 2023](#issue-2009761649) • edited Loading

### Motivation and Context

Closes [#15526](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526).

### Description

Over its history this the dirty dnode test has been changed between checking for a dnodes being on `os_dirty_dnodes` (`dn_dirty_link`) and `dn_dirty_record`.

[de198f2](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/de198f2d9507b6dcf3d0d8f037ba33940208733e) Fix lseek(SEEK\_DATA/SEEK\_HOLE) mmap consistency

[2531ce3](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/2531ce372015a90f090176ae61105a9ea1a8f992) Revert "Report holes when there are only metadata changes"

[ec4f9b8](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/ec4f9b8f30391a3fb46c8d4a31c2dc9250dca1bb) Report holes when there are only metadata changes

[454365b](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/454365bbaacc153f98d2a3adaf33b13a6183d45d) Fix dirty check in dmu\_offset\_next()

[66aca24](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/66aca24730adfb2e3875e5148a03dd1fb435d438) SEEK\_HOLE should not block on txg\_wait\_synced()

Also [illumos/illumos-gate@c543ec060d](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/c543ec060d) [illumos/illumos-gate@2bcf0248e9](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/2bcf0248e9)

It turns out both are actually required.

In the case of appending data to a newly created file, the dnode proper is dirtied (at least to change the blocksize) and dirty records are added. Thus, a single logical operation is represented by separate dirty indicators, and must not be separated.

The incorrect dirty check becomes a problem when the first block of a file is being appended to while another process is calling lseek to skip holes. It can happen that the dnode part is undirtied, while dirty records are still on the dnode for the next txg. In this case, `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_DATA)` would not know that the file is dirty, and would go to `dnode_next_offset()`. Since the object has no data blocks yet, it returns `ESRCH`, indicating no data found, which results in `ENXIO` being returned to `lseek()`'s caller.

Since coreutils 9.2, `cp` performs sparse copies by default, that is, it uses `SEEK_DATA` and `SEEK_HOLE` against the source file and attempts to replicate the holes in the target. When it hits the bug, its initial search for data fails, and it goes on to call `fallocate()` to create a hole over the entire destination file.

This has come up more recently as users upgrade their systems, getting OpenZFS 2.2 as well as a newer coreutils. However, this problem has been reproduced against 2.1, as well as on FreeBSD 13 and 14.

This change simply updates the dirty check to check both types of dirty. If there's anything dirty at all, we immediately go to the "wait for sync" stage, It doesn't really matter after that; both changes are on disk, so the dirty fields should be correct.

### How Has This Been Tested?

[@tonyhutter](https://github.com/tonyhutter) produced a repro script in [#15526](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526) which has been extremely useful. Its not perfect, but it can usually trip the issue in a couple of minutes. With the patch in place, no one has been able to trigger the issue. [@rincebrain](https://github.com/rincebrain) has been driving it reasonably hard (I think), no hits.

Full test suite run has passed.

I've done some general sanity and stress tests on customer workloads. They don't exercise the bug, but they all did fine, so this maybe hasn't broken anything.

I'd like to write a test for this case, since its bitten a few times in the past, but it requires `lseek()` to be called after the dnode proper being undirtied but before the dbufs are undirtied. I don't have that kind of control from outside. Ideas welcome.

Even if it isn't a complete fix, and it seems to work well as that for me, it seems like a pretty safe change given how we kept bouncing between "if A" or "if B" for this check historically.

| Two different Gentoo Linux systems running a patched ZFS (with this commit): they are no longer being able to reproduce the corruption after 4-5 dozens of attempts done with `reproducer.sh` while the issue was triggering fairly easily after 3-4 runs in a row before. Good job! |

| Yeah it's not exactly an attack vector that could be controlled, you'd need an application with permission to modify the file to begin with.  Also both bug fixes need to land in 14, security vulnerability or not. Hopefully an SA is not required for a revised .0 release. |

I have no idea who made the original report (I discovered it today, through [conversation in Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!IBdGSejslGivmIcnQs:matrix.org/$170096766828NOkQr:synapse.scientiam.org?via=matrix.org&via=mozilla.org&via=tchncs.de)).  Re: the CVE, I respectfully suggest discussion elsewhere (Matrix, maybe); so that discussion here can remain focused on *the PR*.  Thanks |

| [@grahamperrin](https://github.com/grahamperrin) worse, the information is misleading (unless I am missing something). Quoting:  OpenZFS through 2.1.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.1, in certain scenarios involving applications that try to rely on efficient copying of file data, can replace file contents with zero-valued bytes  This is simply not true, the corruption issue being spotted on older versions as well. |

| Just to clarify, beyond the minor suggestions for changes in wording, the intention behind my proposal is to make the comment as intelligible/readable as possible.  Especially since it seems that this part of the code has been critically misunderstood (resp. prone to errors) in the past. |

`[dnode_is_dirty: check dnode and its data for dirtiness](/openzfs/zfs/commit/9b9b09f452a469458451c221debfbab944e7f081 "dnode_is_dirty: check dnode and its data for dirtiness

Over its history this the dirty dnode test has been changed between
checking for a dnodes being on `os_dirty_dnodes` (`dn_dirty_link`) and
`dn_dirty_record`.

  66aca2473 SEEK_HOLE should not block on txg_wait_synced()

Also illumos/illumos-gate@c543ec060d illumos/illumos-gate@2bcf0248e9

It turns out both are actually required.

In the case of appending data to a newly created file, the dnode proper
is dirtied (at least to change the blocksize) and dirty records are
added.  Thus, a single logical operation is represented by separate
dirty indicators, and must not be separated.

The incorrect dirty check becomes a problem when the first block of a
file is being appended to while another process is calling lseek to skip
holes. There is a small window where the dnode part is undirtied while
there are still dirty records. In this case, `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_DATA)`
would not know that the file is dirty, and would go to
`dnode_next_offset()`. Since the object has no data blocks yet, it
returns `ESRCH`, indicating no data found, which results in `ENXIO`
being returned to `lseek()`'s caller.

Since coreutils 9.2, `cp` performs sparse copies by default, that is, it
uses `SEEK_DATA` and `SEEK_HOLE` against the source file and attempts to
replicate the holes in the target. When it hits the bug, its initial
search for data fails, and it goes on to call `fallocate()` to create a
hole over the entire destination file.

This has come up more recently as users upgrade their systems, getting
OpenZFS 2.2 as well as a newer coreutils. However, this problem has been
reproduced against 2.1, as well as on FreeBSD 13 and 14.

This change simply updates the dirty check to check both types of dirty.
If there's anything dirty at all, we immediately go to the \"wait for
sync\" stage, It doesn't really matter after that; both changes are on
disk, so the dirty fields should be correct.

search for data fails, and it goes on to call `fallocate()` to create a
hole over the entire destination file.

This has come up more recently as users upgrade their systems, getting
OpenZFS 2.2 as well as a newer coreutils. However, this problem has been
reproduced against 2.1, as well as on FreeBSD 13 and 14.

This change simply updates the dirty check to check both types of dirty.
If there's anything dirty at all, we immediately go to the "wait for
sync" stage, It doesn't really matter after that; both changes are on
disk, so the dirty fields should be correct.

It turns out both are actually required.

In the case of appending data to a newly created file, the dnode proper
is dirtied (at least to change the blocksize) and dirty records are
added.  Thus, a single logical operation is represented by separate
dirty indicators, and must not be separated.

The incorrect dirty check becomes a problem when the first block of a
file is being appended to while another process is calling lseek to skip
holes. There is a small window where the dnode part is undirtied while
there are still dirty records. In this case, `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_DATA)`
would not know that the file is dirty, and would go to
`dnode_next_offset()`. Since the object has no data blocks yet, it
returns `ESRCH`, indicating no data found, which results in `ENXIO`
being returned to `lseek()`'s caller.

Since coreutils 9.2, `cp` performs sparse copies by default, that is, it
uses `SEEK_DATA` and `SEEK_HOLE` against the source file and attempts to

`[dnode_is_dirty: use dn_dirty_txg to check dirtiness](/robn/zfs/commit/531af601a15d69b6c09af9c288ca214d3b68ee6f "dnode_is_dirty: use dn_dirty_txg to check dirtiness

dn_dirty_ctx is always set to the highest txg that has ever dirtied the
dnode. It is set in dbuf_dirty() when a data or metadnode dbuf is
dirtied, and never cleared.

[analysis of bug #15526 and fix #15571 below, for future readers]

The previous dirty check was:

    for (int i = 0; i < TXG_SIZE; i++) {
        if (multilist_link_active(&dn->dn_dirty_link[i])
            [dnode is dirty]

However, this check is not \"is the dnode dirty?\" but rather, \"is the
dnode on a list?\".

There is a gap in dmu_objset_sync_dnodes() where the dnode is moved from
os_dirty_dnodes to os_synced_dnodes, before dnode_sync() is called to
write out the dirty dbufs. So, there is a moment when the dnode is not
on a list, and so the check fails.

It doesn't matter that the dirty check takes dn_mtx, because that lock
isn't used for dn_dirty_link. The os_dirty_dnodes sublist lock is held
in dmu_objset_sync_dnodes(), but trying to take that would mean possibly
waiting until everything on that sublist has been synced.

The correct fix has to check something that positively asserts the dnode
is dirty, rather than an implementation detail. dn_dirty_txg (via
DNODE_IS_DIRTY()) is that - its a normal bit of dnode state, under the
dn_mtx lock, and unambiguously indicates whether or not there's changes
pending.

    toradex_apalis_imx6_defconfig: add download hashes for linux/uboot

    The defconfig fetches Linux and U-Boot from a git repo using the
    unauthenticated git:// protocol, so add download hashes for them to ensure
    we get the right sources by adding a global patch dir and running
    utils/add-custom-hashes.

    The defconfig uses the Linux sources for the kernel headers, so make
    linux-headers/linux-headers.hash a symlink to linux/linux.hash so the same
    hash file is used.

    package/libpjsip: security bump to version 2.14

    Fix CVE-2023-38703: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia
    communication library written in C with high level API in C, C++, Java,
    C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a higher level media transport which
    is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE.
    Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower
    level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This
    vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability
    (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other
    than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from unexpected
    application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The
    patch is available as a commit in the master branch.

    package/erlang: disable for uclibc, fix glibc-build

    Commit 2cfa86a54882(package/erlang: bump version to 26.0.2) added a
    patch to restore building on uClibc.

    However, that patch is not upstream, and has been rejected:

        https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/7500

        Please open a PR to https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit instead and we
        will get the fix next time we sync with upstream. We do not want
        theirs and our implementation to diverge.

    Furthermore, it happens to work on uClibc, because uClibc does not
    expose sys/auxv.h, but it fails to work on glibc, because the define is
    not propagated to \"sub-trees\", and thus is never defined where it is
    checked for, even when sys/auxv.h is available. This causes build
    failures such as:

        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp: In function ‘void asmjit::_abi_1_10::detectHWCaps(CpuInfo&, long unsigned int, const LinuxHWCapMapping*, size_t)’:
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:840:24: error: ‘getauxval’ was not declared in this scope
          840 |   unsigned long mask = getauxval(type);
              |                        ^~~~~~~~~
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp: In function ‘void asmjit::_abi_1_10::detectARMCpu(CpuInfo&)’:
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:972:21: error: ‘AT_HWCAP’ was not declared in this scope
          972 |   detectHWCaps(cpu, AT_HWCAP, hwCapMapping, ASMJIT_ARRAY_SIZE(hwCapMapping));
              |                     ^~~~~~~~
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:973:21: error: ‘AT_HWCAP2’ was not declared in this scope
          973 |   detectHWCaps(cpu, AT_HWCAP2, hwCapMapping2, ASMJIT_ARRAY_SIZE(hwCapMapping2));
              |                     ^~~~~~~~~

    Yet, sys/auxv.h was detected at configure time:

        checking for sys/auxv.h... yes

    This defconfig is enough to reproduce the error:

        BR2_aarch64=y
        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL=y
        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL_BOOTLIN=y
        BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG=y

    Since upstream refused the patch, and there is no fix that was submitted
    to the actual upstream (asmjit), drop the rejectred patch, and disable
    for uClibc: the patch is incorrect, and we can't fix a build issue on
    uClibc by introducing another on glibc.

    Fix CVE-2023-45322: libxml2 through 2.11.5 has a use-after-free that can
    only occur after a certain memory allocation fails. This occurs in
    xmlUnlinkNode in tree.c. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"I don't think
    these issues are critical enough to warrant a CVE ID ... because an
    attacker typically can't control when memory allocations fail.\"

    When the favicon image was added in f26e61319f3f (docs/website: add
    favicon.png), it was added to a different directory then where the header's
    icon link points. This causes the favicon to fail to load with 404.

    board/raspberrypi: fix autoprobing of bluetooth driver

    The commit 689b9ac439 (package/rpi-firmware: rework boot/config file
    handling) has split in two the property:

    	dtoverlay=miniuart-bt,krnbt=on

    Into:

    	dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
    	dtoverlay=krnbt=on

    The initial property contained the dtbo file miniuart-bt[1] and its
    parameter krnbt=on[2][3].

    The first syntax is correct while the second is not. The krnbt=on is not
    a dtoverlay[4] but a dtparam[5]. Therefore the property dtparam must be
    used instead.

    This fixes:

    	# cat /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/chosen/user-warnings
    	Failed to load overlay 'krnbt=on'

    package/netsnmp: revert back to 5.9.3, backport security fix

    In commit 13fc9dcb34926e9b6310b23662920c55c96d83a1, netsnmp was bumped
    from 5.9.3 to 5.9.4 to fix two CVEs.

    However, even though it's a minor version bump, there are actually 163
    commits upstream between those two minor releases, and some of them
    are breaking existing use-cases. In particular upstream
    a2cb167514ac0c7e1b04e8f151e0b015501362e0 now requires that config_()
    macros in MIB files are terminated with a semicolon, causing a build
    breakage with existing MIB files that were totally valid with 5.9.3.

    This commit therefore proposes to revert back to 5.9.3, by reverting
    those two commits:

    56caafceab3ec12669ccb7aa6fc8b653778064e1 package/netsnmp: fix musl build
    13fc9dcb34926e9b6310b23662920c55c96d83a1 package/netsnmp: security bump to version 5.9.4

    and instead backport the one upstream commit that fixes both CVEs.

    package/zfs: fix zfs autotools cross-compilation

    This commit addresses a long-standing bug encountered during ZFS
    compilation in cross-platform environments. The issue arises because ZFS
    autoconf triggers a `make modules` to detect if the kernel can compile
    modules [1]. The problem occurs when autoconf uses the host environment
    instead of the cross-platform environment.

    To fix this, we export necessary environment variables to ensure that ZFS
    autoconf utilizes the cross-platform environment correctly.

    This patch resolves ZFS cross-platform compilations:

    package/zfs: don't download patch generated from github

    Git-generated patches embed the short-hash of the objects in the
    repository. The length of those short hashes are subject to change
    in at least three cases:

      - the number of objects in the repository increases, so git increases
        the length of short hashes to get a good change there is no
        collision;

      - the git configuration changes, see core.abbrev in git-config;

      - the heuristic to compute the length changes in a newer git version.

    Since the bump to zfs 2.1.4 in commit 68dfd09708c6, the patch generated
    by github has changed, causing download failures:

    And indeed, the length of short hashes has increased by one since then.

    Fix that by bundling the patch, with the short hashes that were known
    then, so that it matches the sha256 we had for it.

    package/gcc: fix disabling the documentation

    gcc.mk attempts to disable building the documentation by setting
    MAKEINFO=missing, but it is not working.  If makeinfo is installed
    and recent enough, gcc still uses it.  This can be checked easily:

    grep BUILD_INFO='info' host-gcc-initial-*/build/gcc/config.log

    It happens because the root ./configure script will check
    $MAKEINFO --version (aka 'missing --version') and will overwrite it with
    MAKEINFO='missing makeinfo' because the version does not match.

    Having MAKEINFO='missing makeinfo' is a problem because
    'missing makeinfo' will actually attempt to run 'makeinfo' before
    failing with an error message.  If makeinfo is installed on the host,
    then 'missing makeinfo' will successfully run makeinfo anyway.

    Many gcc subprojects will check $MAKEINFO --version and enable building
    the documentation if it is recent enough.  This patch overrides these
    checks by forcing gcc_cv_prog_makeinfo_modern=no.

    Building the GCC documentation can fail with the wrong makeinfo version.
    It happened at least when building GCC 11.3.0 with makeinfo 7.1.

    toradex_apalis_imx6_defconfig: add download hashes for linux/uboot

    The defconfig fetches Linux and U-Boot from a git repo using the
    unauthenticated git:// protocol, so add download hashes for them to ensure
    we get the right sources by adding a global patch dir and running
    utils/add-custom-hashes.

    The defconfig uses the Linux sources for the kernel headers, so make
    linux-headers/linux-headers.hash a symlink to linux/linux.hash so the same
    hash file is used.

    package/libpjsip: security bump to version 2.14

    Fix CVE-2023-38703: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia
    communication library written in C with high level API in C, C++, Java,
    C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a higher level media transport which
    is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE.
    Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower
    level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This
    vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability
    (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other
    than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from unexpected
    application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The
    patch is available as a commit in the master branch.

    package/erlang: disable for uclibc, fix glibc-build

    Commit [2cfa86a](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/2cfa86a54882f2831b36a78a0ca642aa3a4bd0a4)(package/erlang: bump version to 26.0.2) added a
    patch to restore building on uClibc.

    However, that patch is not upstream, and has been rejected:

        [erlang/otp#7500](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/7500)

        Please open a PR to <https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit> instead and we
        will get the fix next time we sync with upstream. We do not want
        theirs and our implementation to diverge.

    Furthermore, it happens to work on uClibc, because uClibc does not
    expose sys/auxv.h, but it fails to work on glibc, because the define is
    not propagated to "sub-trees", and thus is never defined where it is
    checked for, even when sys/auxv.h is available. This causes build
    failures such as:

        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp: In function ‘void asmjit::_abi_1_10::detectHWCaps(CpuInfo&, long unsigned int, const LinuxHWCapMapping*, size_t)’:
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:840:24: error: ‘getauxval’ was not declared in this scope
          840 |   unsigned long mask = getauxval(type);
              |                        ^~~~~~~~~
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp: In function ‘void asmjit::_abi_1_10::detectARMCpu(CpuInfo&)’:
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:972:21: error: ‘AT_HWCAP’ was not declared in this scope
          972 |   detectHWCaps(cpu, AT_HWCAP, hwCapMapping, ASMJIT_ARRAY_SIZE(hwCapMapping));
              |                     ^~~~~~~~
        asmjit/core/cpuinfo.cpp:973:21: error: ‘AT_HWCAP2’ was not declared in this scope
          973 |   detectHWCaps(cpu, AT_HWCAP2, hwCapMapping2, ASMJIT_ARRAY_SIZE(hwCapMapping2));
              |                     ^~~~~~~~~

    Yet, sys/auxv.h was detected at configure time:

        checking for sys/auxv.h... yes

    This defconfig is enough to reproduce the error:

        BR2_aarch64=y
        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL=y
        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL_BOOTLIN=y
        BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG=y

    Since upstream refused the patch, and there is no fix that was submitted
    to the actual upstream (asmjit), drop the rejectred patch, and disable
    for uClibc: the patch is incorrect, and we can't fix a build issue on
    uClibc by introducing another on glibc.

    package/libxml2: security bump to version 2.11.6

    Fix [CVE-2023-45322](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqpg-m25j-7558 "CVE-2023-45322"): libxml2 through 2.11.5 has a use-after-free that can
    only occur after a certain memory allocation fails. This occurs in
    xmlUnlinkNode in tree.c. NOTE: the vendor's position is "I don't think
    these issues are critical enough to warrant a CVE ID ... because an
    attacker typically can't control when memory allocations fail."

    icon link points. This causes the favicon to fail to load with 404.

    While we are here, remove the "shortcut" rel attribute as it is non-standard
    and it's recommended not to use it[1].

    board/raspberrypi: fix autoprobing of bluetooth driver

    The commit [689b9ac](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/689b9ac439ab7b507c8982b6102bddf59d03efbf) (package/rpi-firmware: rework boot/config file
    handling) has split in two the property:

    	dtoverlay=miniuart-bt,krnbt=on

    Into:

    	dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
    	dtoverlay=krnbt=on

    The initial property contained the dtbo file miniuart-bt[1] and its
    parameter krnbt=on[2][3].

    The first syntax is correct while the second is not. The krnbt=on is not
    a dtoverlay[4] but a dtparam[5]. Therefore the property dtparam must be
    used instead.

    This fixes:

    	# cat /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/chosen/user-warnings
    	Failed to load overlay 'krnbt=on'

    package/netsnmp: revert back to 5.9.3, backport security fix

    In commit [13fc9dc](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/13fc9dcb34926e9b6310b23662920c55c96d83a1), netsnmp was bumped
    from 5.9.3 to 5.9.4 to fix two CVEs.

    However, even though it's a minor version bump, there are actually 163
    commits upstream between those two minor releases, and some of them
    are breaking existing use-cases. In particular upstream
    a2cb167514ac0c7e1b04e8f151e0b015501362e0 now requires that config_()
    macros in MIB files are terminated with a semicolon, causing a build
    breakage with existing MIB files that were totally valid with 5.9.3.

    This commit therefore proposes to revert back to 5.9.3, by reverting
    those two commits:

    [56caafc](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/56caafceab3ec12669ccb7aa6fc8b653778064e1) package/netsnmp: fix musl build
    [13fc9dc](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/13fc9dcb34926e9b6310b23662920c55c96d83a1) package/netsnmp: security bump to version 5.9.4

    and instead backport the one upstream commit that fixes both CVEs.

    package/zfs: fix zfs autotools cross-compilation

    This commit addresses a long-standing bug encountered during ZFS
    compilation in cross-platform environments. The issue arises because ZFS
    autoconf triggers a `make modules` to detect if the kernel can compile
    modules [1]. The problem occurs when autoconf uses the host environment
    instead of the cross-platform environment.

    To fix this, we export necessary environment variables to ensure that ZFS
    autoconf utilizes the cross-platform environment correctly.

    This patch resolves ZFS cross-platform compilations:

    package/zfs: don't download patch generated from github

    Git-generated patches embed the short-hash of the objects in the
    repository. The length of those short hashes are subject to change
    in at least three cases:

      - the number of objects in the repository increases, so git increases
        the length of short hashes to get a good change there is no
        collision;

      - the git configuration changes, see core.abbrev in git-config;

      - the heuristic to compute the length changes in a newer git version.

    Since the bump to zfs 2.1.4 in commit [68dfd09](https://github.com/Relms12345/buildroot/commit/68dfd09708c66f1aeca3bf5725eb83c7ea5b35c8), the patch generated

    And indeed, the length of short hashes has increased by one since then.

    Fix that by bundling the patch, with the short hashes that were known
    then, so that it matches the sha256 we had for it.

    package/gcc: fix disabling the documentation

    gcc.mk attempts to disable building the documentation by setting
    MAKEINFO=missing, but it is not working.  If makeinfo is installed
    and recent enough, gcc still uses it.  This can be checked easily:

    grep BUILD_INFO='info' host-gcc-initial-*/build/gcc/config.log

    It happens because the root ./configure script will check
    $MAKEINFO --version (aka 'missing --version') and will overwrite it with
    MAKEINFO='missing makeinfo' because the version does not match.

    Having MAKEINFO='missing makeinfo' is a problem because
    'missing makeinfo' will actually attempt to run 'makeinfo' before
    failing with an error message.  If makeinfo is installed on the host,
    then 'missing makeinfo' will successfully run makeinfo anyway.

    Many gcc subprojects will check $MAKEINFO --version and enable building
    the documentation if it is recent enough.  This patch overrides these
    checks by forcing gcc_cv_prog_makeinfo_modern=no.

    Building the GCC documentation can fail with the wrong makeinfo version.
    It happened at least when building GCC 11.3.0 with makeinfo 7.1.

Over its history this the dirty dnode test has been changed between
checking for a dnodes being on `os_dirty_dnodes` (`dn_dirty_link`) and
`dn_dirty_record`.

  66aca2473 SEEK_HOLE should not block on txg_wait_synced()

Also illumos/illumos-gate@c543ec060d illumos/illumos-gate@2bcf0248e9

It turns out both are actually required.

In the case of appending data to a newly created file, the dnode proper
is dirtied (at least to change the blocksize) and dirty records are
added.  Thus, a single logical operation is represented by separate
dirty indicators, and must not be separated.

The incorrect dirty check becomes a problem when the first block of a
file is being appended to while another process is calling lseek to skip
holes. There is a small window where the dnode part is undirtied while
there are still dirty records. In this case, `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_DATA)`
would not know that the file is dirty, and would go to
`dnode_next_offset()`. Since the object has no data blocks yet, it
returns `ESRCH`, indicating no data found, which results in `ENXIO`
being returned to `lseek()`'s caller.

Since coreutils 9.2, `cp` performs sparse copies by default, that is, it
uses `SEEK_DATA` and `SEEK_HOLE` against the source file and attempts to
replicate the holes in the target. When it hits the bug, its initial
search for data fails, and it goes on to call `fallocate()` to create a
hole over the entire destination file.

This has come up more recently as users upgrade their systems, getting
OpenZFS 2.2 as well as a newer coreutils. However, this problem has been
reproduced against 2.1, as well as on FreeBSD 13 and 14.

This change simply updates the dirty check to check both types of dirty.
If there's anything dirty at all, we immediately go to the \"wait for
sync\" stage, It doesn't really matter after that; both changes are on
disk, so the dirty fields should be correct.
