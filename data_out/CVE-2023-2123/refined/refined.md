Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2123:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization and escaping of the `message` parameter within the WP Inventory Manager plugin before it is outputted back into the page's HTML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which means that the malicious script is injected through a crafted URL, and executed by the victim's browser when they visit that URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code: A successful XSS attack can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Displaying misleading content

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted URL parameters: The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a specific parameter (`message`) containing the XSS payload. This URL is then delivered to the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious crafted link. No authentication is required.
- Knowledge of vulnerable plugin: The attacker needs to know that the target site is using the vulnerable WP Inventory Manager plugin and its vulnerable parameter.
- Payload encoding: The attacker must URL-encode the XSS payload. Double encoding can also be used to bypass some security controls.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in WP Inventory Manager versions prior to 2.1.0.13.
- The PoC involves:
    1. Creating an inventory item.
    2. Adding the `[wpinventory]` shortcode to a page.
    3. Viewing the page and the item.
    4. Adding the `message` URL parameter with a script payload.
- The provided PoC uses `%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C%2Fscript%3E` (URL encoded `<script>alert(1)</script>`) and a double-encoded payload `%253Cscript%253Ealert%2528%2522pwned%2520by%2520daniloalbuqrque%2522%2529%253C%252Fscript%253E` to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 7.5 (high).
