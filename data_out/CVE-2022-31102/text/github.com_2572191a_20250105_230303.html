# A leaked API server encryption key can allow XSS for SSO users

Low

[crenshaw-dev](/crenshaw-dev)
published
GHSA-pmjg-52h9-72qv
Jul 12, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/argoproj/argo-cd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

2.3.0 through 2.3.5, 2.4.4

## Patched versions

2.3.6, 2.4.5

## Description

### Impact

All versions of Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser.

This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have SSO enabled.

The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link.

The vulnerability is classified as low severity, because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key.

### Patches

A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:

* v2.4.5
* v2.3.6

### Workarounds

There is no workaround besides upgrading.

### Credits

Disclosed by ADA Logics in a security audit of the Argo project sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF. Thanks to Adam Korczynski and David Korczynski for their work on the audit.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
