Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `clj_media_size` function within the `devices/gdevclj.c` file of Ghostscript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `clj_media_size` function attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition, as reported in the Debian LTS advisory.
- The ASAN report shows a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow during a read operation outside the allocated memory region.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted PDF file or PostScript language input. Specifically, the provided poc.pdf triggers the vulnerability.
- The `clj_pr_put_params`, `default_subclass_put_params`, `gs_putdeviceparams`, and `zputdeviceparams` functions are part of the call chain that leads to the vulnerable function `clj_media_size`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF or PostScript file to Ghostscript for processing to trigger the vulnerability. This could be through a variety of means depending on how Ghostscript is used within an application.
