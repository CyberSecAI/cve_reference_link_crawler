- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets sent to the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist (CWE-120 and CWE-77). Specifically, these are buffer overflow and command injection vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with root-level privileges or cause the device to restart unexpectedly, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of the routers. The interface can be accessed through the LAN or WAN (if remote management is enabled).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid Administrator credentials on the affected device. Remote access is possible if the remote management feature is enabled.

The advisory explicitly states that the affected products are end-of-life and no fixes will be released. It also lists multiple CVEs affected by the same root cause and provides the CVSS score (4.7) and vector for the issue.
