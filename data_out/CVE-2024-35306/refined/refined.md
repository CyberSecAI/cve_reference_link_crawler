**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-35306

**Description:** OS Command injection in Ajax PHP files through HTTP Request

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of input parameters in Ajax PHP files, allowing an attacker to inject OS commands through HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**Attack vectors:**
*   HTTP Request: The attack is carried out through crafted HTTP requests, targeting specific Ajax PHP files with malicious OS command injections.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and target the vulnerable Ajax PHP files.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 777 of Pandora FMS.
