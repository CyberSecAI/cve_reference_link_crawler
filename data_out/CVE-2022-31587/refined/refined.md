*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided input (`filename`, `path` parameters) before passing it to the `send_file` function.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially including sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker can send crafted HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires no special privileges, nor any user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Scope Change:**  The scope is changed, meaning a vulnerability in one component (the Flask application) can be used to impact resources beyond that component, i.e. the server's filesystem.
*   **CWE:** The weakness is consistently categorized as CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').
*   **CVSS:**  Most vulnerabilities listed have a base score of **9.3 (Critical)**. CVE-2022-31570 has a CVSS score of **9.8 (Critical)** and CVE-2022-31566 has a CVSS score of **8.6 (High)**.
*   **Remediation:** The suggested fix is to avoid using `flask.send_file` with unsanitized user input. Instead, `flask.safe_join` or `flask.send_from_directory` should be used, or the untrusted input should not be used for file path construction.

**Important Note:**

The provided information highlights a common vulnerability pattern across multiple Flask applications, namely, insecure usage of the `send_file` function. It is essential to understand and address this vulnerability when developing Flask web applications to prevent potential absolute path traversal attacks. The suggested fixes using `safe_join` or `send_from_directory` are standard and should be incorporated to prevent this vulnerability. The comments from `skavanagh` also bring to light some of the issues when security tools give false positives or generate a CVE when a project does not have the basic requirements.
