Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a file inclusion flaw in the INOTEC Sicherheitstechnik GmbH WebServer CPS220/64 V.3.3.19. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary files on the server's file system to be read by the webserver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **File Inclusion:** The primary vulnerability is a file inclusion vulnerability. The webserver application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input to the 'file' parameter in the `/cgi-bin/display` endpoint. This allows for the inclusion of arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the server. The example provided shows reading the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains user information (although passwords are often hashed). This could potentially expose usernames or other system information.
*   **Remote Code Execution Potential:** The description mentions this vulnerability *may* lead to remote code execution, although it does not specify how. Usually this can be achieved if a readable file is also executable, or if an attacker can write a configuration file and then read it with the file inclusion vulnerability. This is a serious potential consequence that could allow the attacker to take full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to a specific URL.
*   **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `file` parameter in the URL to point to the file they wish to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable INOTEC WebServer.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `/cgi-bin/display` endpoint and its `file` parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the description, the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it easier to exploit.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   **Vulnerable Product:** The specific product affected is INOTEC Sicherheitstechnik GmbH WebServer CPS220/64 V.3.3.19
*   **Vulnerable URL Example:** `http://<ip address>/cgi-bin/display?file=/etc/passwd` demonstrates how to access the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   **Reference:** The vendor's website is referenced (`https://www.inotec-licht.de/`)
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Safvan Parakkal
