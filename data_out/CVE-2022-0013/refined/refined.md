- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A file information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent that enables a local attacker to read arbitrary files with elevated privileges when generating a support file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: File and Directory Information Exposure (CWE-538)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can read the contents of arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, user interaction required (generating a support file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local attacker with low privileges is required and needs user interaction to generate support files.
