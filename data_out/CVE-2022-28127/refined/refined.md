- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `/ajax/remove/` API of the Robustel R1510 web server. Specifically, the API checks for `..` to prevent path traversal, but it doesn't prevent absolute paths from being used in the `file_name` parameter.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The web server does not properly validate the input provided to the `/ajax/remove/` API. It only checks for `..` but not other methods to perform file system traversal.
    - **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Due to the lack of proper input validation, an attacker can manipulate the `file_name` parameter to delete any file on the system.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files and directories on the affected system, which could lead to denial of service, data loss, or other malicious activities.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted network request to the `/ajax/remove/` API endpoint, specifically controlling the `file_name` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web server and control the `file_name` parameter within the request. The report does not explicitly mention specific authentication requirements, but the CVSS score indicates that high privileges are needed, meaning it's not an anonymous vulnerability.
