The provided content is related to CVE-2014-125083.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-provided input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the code concatenates user-supplied values (username and domain) directly into a SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization, which leads to the risk of SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the direct concatenation of user-provided strings into SQL queries without proper escaping, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to unauthorized access or modification of the database, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the username or domain parameters to include malicious SQL syntax, which is then concatenated into the query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to control or manipulate the username or domain values that are used to construct the SQL query. This could be achieved through various means depending on where these values are sourced within the application such as through a form or an API endpoint.

**Technical Details:**
The code changes include:
- **DctmAuthenticationManager.java:** Modification in the `getUserName` method where the user login name and domain name are concatenated into a SQL query. The change adds `DqlUtils.escapeString` and `DqlUtils.escapePattern` to mitigate SQL injection risks by escaping special characters in the user input.
- **DqlUtils.java:** Addition of `escapeString` and `escapePattern` methods. `escapeString` escapes single quotes by doubling them, while `escapePattern` escapes single quotes and SQL LIKE wildcards (%) and underscore (_), using a given escape character.
- **DctmMockAuthenticationManagerTest.java:** Addition of tests to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **DqlUtilsTest.java:** Addition of tests for the `escapeString` and `escapePattern` methods, covering null, empty, unescaped and escaped string scenarios.

The code changes address the SQL injection vulnerability by properly escaping the single quotes (') and special characters like % and _ used in LIKE clauses, within the user-provided values.
