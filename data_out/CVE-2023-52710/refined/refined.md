- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect check on the size of a memory buffer. An improperly-sized memory buffer is crafted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions leading to a memory buffer issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could cause OS service exceptions.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with common privileges is required. The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable PC.
