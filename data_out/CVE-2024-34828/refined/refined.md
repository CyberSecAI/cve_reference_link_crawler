  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that makes the crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site but needs to trick an authenticated user to perform the malicious action. The attacker needs to know the target WordPress site URL."
