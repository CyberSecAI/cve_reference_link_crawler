Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `/Admin/changepassword.php` file of the SourceCodester Prison Management System 1.0. Specifically, the values of `txtold_password`, `txtnew_password`, and `txtconfirm_password` parameters are directly echoed into the HTML code without any encoding or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application directly embeds the user-provided input into the HTML response, which allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage. This code can then be used for various malicious purposes, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Modifying the content of the page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Keylogging.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `/Admin/changepassword.php` page.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `txtold_password`, `txtnew_password`, and `txtconfirm_password` parameters. This payload, containing JavaScript, will be reflected back in the HTML response and executed by the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   They must know the location of the vulnerable page `/Admin/changepassword.php` and the names of the vulnerable parameters (`txtold_password`, `txtnew_password`, and `txtconfirm_password`).
*   The attacker can target any user who visits the vulnerable page with the crafted payload.
