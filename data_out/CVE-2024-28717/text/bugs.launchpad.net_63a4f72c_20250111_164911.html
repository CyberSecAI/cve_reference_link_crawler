### Bug Description

The vulnerability is at <https://github.com/openstack/storlets/blob/928de77bac448c9bc04a274c494608ce7190563a/storlets/gateway/gateways/docker/gateway.py#L320C20-L320C30>

Take gateway.py#L320C20-L320C30 for example:

```

 with open(cache\_target\_path, 'wb') as fn:

                for data in data\_iter:

                    fn.write(data)

if not is\_storlet:

                if not perm:

                    perm = '0600'

                os.chmod(cache\_target\_path, int(perm, 8))

```

When a file is first written and then its permissions are later changed using chmod, there exists a potential security risk known as a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) attack. In this type of attack, an attacker exploits the time window between when the file is initially written and when its permissions are modified. During this time window, the attacker may gain access to the file.

commit 5ad58804af885db3eb7a78bea5000c401eeeb70e

Author: Takashi Kajinami <email address hidden>

Date: Sun Jan 21 02:30:33 2024 +0900

Restrict access to local storlet/dependency files

Now swift and storlet daemon inside containers run with consistent uid

    so we don't need group/other permissions.

Also chown should be executed before actual file content is written,

    so that the content is not read by a different user.

Closes-Bug: #2047723
