### @orta **[orta](/orta)** commented [Mar 22, 2022](#issue-1177129095)

It's possible to engineer a string which would cause the hg or git command to run shell commands, this has been blocked up in trunk already ([CocoaPods/trunk.cocoapods.org#324](https://github.com/CocoaPods/trunk.cocoapods.org/pull/324)) and this fixes it client-side

Sorry, something went wrong.
