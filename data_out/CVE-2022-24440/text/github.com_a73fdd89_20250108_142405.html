### @orta **[orta](/orta)** commented [Mar 31, 2022](#issue-1188409970)

The refactor in [#127](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader/pull/127) moved everything into the `download` path (as all API consumers would have to use that eventually) but `self.preprocess_options` can get called before that (and independently of it) and so this handles that case.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`--` was added to the version of git shipped with 2.25, but version 2.24 is still pretty actively used by default in osx as Apple Git-128 somewhere about 2 years ago - we shouldn't rely solely on the `--` IMO

I'm trying to get an old git to test that this param is ignored ATM
