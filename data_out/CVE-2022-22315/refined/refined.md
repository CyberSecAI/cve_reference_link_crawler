- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in resource creation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Users with `create-resource` permission for standard resource types can create child resources that inherit custom types, even if they lack permission to create the custom resource type directly. This allows privilege escalation by exploiting the inheritance mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create resources with custom types, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over the system's resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack through the UrbanCode Deploy application interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an account with `create-resource` permission for standard resources within UrbanCode Deploy.
