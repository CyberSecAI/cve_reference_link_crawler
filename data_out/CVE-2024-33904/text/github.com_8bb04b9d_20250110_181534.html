| Does it actually allow an attacker to do anything that can't be done with `hyprctl plugin load malware-plugin.so`? |

| No. Someone needs access to write to /tmp/hypr, so... they have to be running code on your system already, at which point they can also `rm -rf /`. That's why this CVE is a joke.  The only "issue" is that other users could do this as well, which they now can't after [28c8561](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/commit/28c85619243e6320e75d7abcfe8244fa99d054dd). ~~Though, other users can still technically `hyprctl --instance x plugin load malware.so`, maybe I should restrict --instance to same user.~~ Never mind, it's 770. |

Awesome work on Hyprland btw, keep it up. |
