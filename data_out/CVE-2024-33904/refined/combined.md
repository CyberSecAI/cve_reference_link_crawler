Subject: Suspicious hook-loading mechanism in hyprland

Hi!

Someone passed along <https://blog.vaxry.net/articles/2024-own-malloc> to
me, and I noticed some curious bits.

hyprland seems to have committed an interesting homebrew malloc
implementation (which is fine in theory), but the reasons for it
existing & how it works are not so fine.

Fisrt, it relies on writing an object file at a predictable
path in /tmp and reading it back later.

It was needed to facilitate a trampoline which looks.. unsound. The
whole hook system looks terrifying.

Initial reading:
* <https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/965a2e5b213eee595808bc7bff28e7df59442720/src/plugins/HookSystem.cpp#L138>
* <https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/965a2e5b213eee595808bc7bff28e7df59442720/src/plugins/HookSystem.cpp#L188>

There are some primitives that may be useful even once the hook setup is
done too.

I have charitably termed the mechanism "not robust". I haven't reported
it upstream because of their hostility on other matters. I don't feel
too guilty about not having reported it given it fell out so immediately
upon inspection.

I don't plan on spending more time on this, sorry, but I felt like I had
to share it.

thanks,
sam

| It's a joke and not a CVE. Nobody even assigned it a CVE. What are you on about?  Anyways, it's fixed already: [28c8561](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/commit/28c85619243e6320e75d7abcfe8244fa99d054dd) |

| Does it actually allow an attacker to do anything that can't be done with `hyprctl plugin load malware-plugin.so`? |

| No. Someone needs access to write to /tmp/hypr, so... they have to be running code on your system already, at which point they can also `rm -rf /`. That's why this CVE is a joke.  The only "issue" is that other users could do this as well, which they now can't after [28c8561](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/commit/28c85619243e6320e75d7abcfe8244fa99d054dd). ~~Though, other users can still technically `hyprctl --instance x plugin load malware.so`, maybe I should restrict --instance to same user.~~ Never mind, it's 770. |

Awesome work on Hyprland btw, keep it up. |
