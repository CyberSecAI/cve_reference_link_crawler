Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/05/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_7.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, May 7, 2024

The Stable channel has been updated to 124.0.6367.155/.156 for Mac and Windows and 124.0.6367.155 for Linux which will roll out over the coming days/weeks. A full list of changes in this build is available in the [Log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/124.0.6367.118..124.0.6367.156?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

The Extended Stable channel has been updated to 124.0.6367.155 for Mac and  Windows which will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [2](https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1223088:3-M124) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[TBD][[337766133](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/337766133)] High CVE-2024-4558: Use after free in ANGLE. Reported by gelatin dessert on 2024-04-29

[TBD][[331369797](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/331369797)] High CVE-2024-4559: Heap buffer overflow in WebAudio. Reported by Cassidy Kim(@cassidy6564) on 2024-03-26

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

Interested in switching release channels? Find out how [here](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](https://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://support.google.com/chrome/community) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
