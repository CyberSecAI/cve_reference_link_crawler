Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-28056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how AWS Amplify CLI and Amplify Studio manage IAM role trust policies when an authentication component is removed from an Amplify project. Specifically, when authentication is removed, the tool modifies the IAM role trust policy to allow any Cognito Identity pool to assume the role, effectively making it publicly assumable. This occurs because the condition that restricts access to the role to only specific Cognito Identity Pools is removed during the removal of the authentication component.

Additionally, older versions of the Amplify CLI (between July 2018 and August 2019) created IAM roles with overly permissive trust policies by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Overly Permissive IAM Role Trust Policies:** IAM roles associated with AWS Amplify projects were configured to allow `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com` to assume the role without proper conditions to restrict access to specific Cognito Identity Pools.
    *   Variant 1: Removing the authentication component from an Amplify project via CLI or Studio resulted in a trust policy without any condition.
    *   Variant 2: Older versions of Amplify CLI created roles with a default trust policy that lacked the condition of the `aud` claim.
2.  **Lack of Least Privilege:** IAM roles retained their privileges even after the authentication component was removed, meaning that a compromised role could be used to carry out actions that the role was authorized to perform.
3. **Clear Text Exposure of ARNs:** The ARNs of vulnerable roles are discoverable through public Github repositories.
4. **Basic Authflow Vulnerability:** Using the Basic authflow in Cognito identity pools allows users to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API call, with the ARN of the role in the victim account. This can be exploited even when the role's trust policy contains an `authenticated` condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can assume vulnerable IAM roles, gaining unauthorized access to AWS resources.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Because roles often have broad permissions (including full access policies), an attacker can gain control over resources associated with those roles.
*   **Data Breach/Resource Modification:** Attackers could read, modify, or delete data or resources within the AWS account depending on the permissions associated with the assumed role.
* **Cross-Account access:** An attacker can assume a vulnerable role in a victim AWS account, from a different AWS account that they control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Publicly Accessible IAM Role ARNs:** Attackers can find IAM role ARNs through public GitHub repositories and other methods.
*   **Cognito Identity Pools:** Attackers can create their own Cognito Identity Pools to generate the necessary tokens to assume vulnerable roles. They can use either unauthenticated or authenticated tokens, depending on the IAM role trust policy condition.
*   **sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity:** The vulnerable roles can be assumed using this API call.
*   **Amplify CLI/Studio:** The vulnerability occurs when removing the authentication component in Amplify CLI and Studio.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **AWS Account:** Attackers need an AWS account to create their own Cognito Identity Pools.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Role ARNs:** Attackers must know the ARN of the vulnerable IAM role.
*   **Basic understanding of AWS authentication and authorization:** Attackers need basic skills to perform the steps necessary to assume an IAM role using sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity and generate necessary tokens.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Timeline:** The vulnerability was present in Amplify CLI since August 2019, and earlier versions had the vulnerability by default (since July 2018).
*   **Mitigation:** AWS mitigated this issue with changes to the Security Token Service (STS) and IAM control plane. These changes block cross-account role assumption with vulnerable policies and prevent new vulnerable roles from being created.
*  **Vulnerable Configurations**
    *   Variant One: `Effect: Allow` without any `Condition`.
    *   Variant Two: `Effect: Allow` with `ForAnyValue:StringLike` condition set for `"cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:amr"` and a value of either `authenticated` or `unauthenticated`
