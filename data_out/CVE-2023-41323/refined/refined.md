- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to enumerate user logins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** User login enumeration due to improper access controls.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can enumerate existing user logins, potentially facilitating further attacks (e.g., brute-force login attempts). The confidentiality of user login information is compromised, although there is no impact on integrity or availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction is required. An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
