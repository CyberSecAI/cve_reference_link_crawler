Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `icon_align` attribute within the Content Switcher widget of the Elementor Addon Elements plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious code injected through the `icon_align` attribute is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts (e.g., JavaScript) in the context of a user's browser session when they visit a page containing the vulnerable widget.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  While not directly stated, XSS can be leveraged to perform actions on behalf of a victim user, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications, data theft, or further attacks.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin:** The attack vector is through a vulnerable WordPress plugin, specifically the 'Elementor Addon Elements' plugin.
*   **Content Switcher Widget:** The vulnerability exists within the Content Switcher widget of the plugin.
*   **`icon_align` Attribute:** The injection point is the `icon_align` attribute of the Content Switcher widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user.
*   **Contributor Level Access or Higher:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to WordPress. This level of access allows the attacker to modify content and utilize the vulnerable widget.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Elementor Addon Elements plugin up to and including version 1.12.12.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.13. The provided code diff shows the fix implemented in version 1.13 uses the `esc_attr()` function to escape the `icon_align` attribute, mitigating the XSS risk.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Nikolas - mdr.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-1393 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the Elementor Addon Elements plugin. It allows authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher to inject malicious scripts by exploiting the lack of sanitization in the `icon_align` attribute of the Content Switcher widget. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser when visiting an affected page.
