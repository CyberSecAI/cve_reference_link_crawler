Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `password` parameter, before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `password` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code such as `'or'1'='1`, an attacker can bypass the login authentication and gain access to the application without valid credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log in with an administrator account, giving them elevated privileges and access to sensitive data and functionalities within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the login form of the application, specifically by manipulating the `password` input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable application.
*   They need to be able to inject SQL code into the `password` parameter. No prior authentication or specific privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `/hrm/index.php` of the "Human Resource Management System 1.0".
*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how an attacker can log in using the payload `'or'1'='1` to bypass authentication.
*   The content includes images showcasing the login bypass and the vulnerable source code snippet.
