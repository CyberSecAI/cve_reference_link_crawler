- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ZKTeco WDMS application performs input validation only on the frontend, while lacking proper backend validation. This allows an attacker to bypass the frontend restrictions by intercepting and modifying the request before it reaches the backend.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application stores user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the "Emp Name" (EName) field of the employee data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities against other users of the application.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker intercepts the HTTP request to modify employee information using a tool like Burp Suite.
    - The attacker modifies the "Emp Name" field to include a malicious JavaScript payload, bypassing the frontend input restrictions.
    - The modified request is then sent to the server.
    - The malicious script is stored in the database and executed when any user views the employee information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the ZKTeco WDMS system with the ability to modify employee information and have the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
