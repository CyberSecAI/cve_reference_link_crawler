Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35190:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip` module in Asterisk. Specifically, after the introduction of the 'transport' identify\_by option, the logic for matching incoming SIP requests to configured endpoints was flawed. Instead of correctly comparing the source IP address, the code was matching against the *local* IP address of the Asterisk server. This is because it was trying to match based on the bound address of the transport, instead of the source address of the traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect matching logic:** The `ip_identify_match_check` function, when used with the 'transport' identifier, incorrectly matched all unauthorized SIP requests with the local server's endpoint, regardless of the actual source IP.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access/calls:** Due to the faulty matching logic, any unauthorized SIP request was incorrectly identified as originating from the local Asterisk server. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and make unauthorized calls, potentially leading to toll fraud or other forms of abuse.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability**: The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and no impact on integrity or availability. However, the ability to make unauthorized calls can have broader negative consequences on an organization.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if the Asterisk server is exposed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Asterisk server.
*   **SIP knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) to formulate requests.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was introduced in versions 18.23.0, 20.8.0, and 21.3.0 of Asterisk.
* The vulnerability was addressed by reverting the changes introduced in PR #602, which added the 'transport' identify\_by option.
* Patched versions are 18.23.1, 20.8.1, and 21.3.1, which remove the vulnerable code.
* The vulnerability was assigned CWE-303, CWE-480, and CWE-670.
* The pull requests #600 and #602 are directly related to the vulnerability, and PR #739 reverts the changes from PR #602 due to the security flaw.
