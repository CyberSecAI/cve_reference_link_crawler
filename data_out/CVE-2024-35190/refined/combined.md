# res\_pjsip\_endpoint\_identifier\_ip: wrongly matches ALL unauthorized SIP requests

Moderate

[gtjoseph](/gtjoseph)
published
GHSA-qqxj-v78h-hrf9
May 17, 2024

## Package

asterisk
(Asterisk)

## Affected versions

= 18.23.0
= 20.8.0
= 21.3.0

## Patched versions

18.23.1
20.8.1
21.3.1

## Description

### Summary

After upgrade to 18.23.0 I found out that ALL unauthorized SIP requests are identified as PJSIP Endpoint of local asterisk server.

Suspicious PRs

[#600](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/pull/600)

[#602](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/pull/602)

### Details

I have PJSIP Endpoint 'local\_asterisk' which is identified by ip of local asterisk server ip-address.

```
[udp_local]
type=transport
protocol=udp
bind=192.168.0.1

[asterisk_local]
type=endpoint
transport=udp_local

[asterisk_local]
type=identify
endpoint=asterisk_local
identify_by=ip
match=192.168.0.1/32

```

Client SIP request from source ip-address 192.168.0.2 to asterisk 192.168.0.1

Debug log of res\_pjsip\_endpoint\_identifier\_ip for version 18.23.0

```
res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: Address 192.168.0.2:21320 does not match identify 'asterisk_local'
res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: Address 192.168.0.1:5060 matches identify 'asterisk_local'
res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: Transport UDP matches identify 'asterisk_local'
res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: Identify 'asterisk_local' SIP message matched to endpoint asterisk_local

```

Debug log of res\_pjsip\_endpoint\_identifier\_ip for version 18.22.0

```
res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip.c: Source address 192.168.0.2:7276 does not match identify 'asterisk_local'

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Add ability to match against PJSIP request URI.

Use the 'request\_uri' identifier in the identify\_by field.

Fixes: [#599](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/issues/599)

| I've updated the commit message to the requested format.  Yep but you also need to update it in the PR description or the issue won't get closed when the PR merges. You also didn't amend your previous commit so now you have 2 commits again. you still need to add the 'cherry-pick" lines ~~and sign the CLA~~.

We usually don't have multiple alembic changes going on at the same time but unfortunately, you got caught again. You're going to have to rebase your PR on current master again and change the Revises and down\_revision to 8fce8496f03e

Add ability to match against PJSIP request URI.

UserNote: this new feature let users match endpoints based on the
indound SIP requests' URI. To do so, add 'request_uri' to the
endpoint's 'identify_by' option. The 'match_request_uri' option of
the identify can be an exact match for the entire request uri, or a
regular expression (between slashes). It's quite similar to the
header identifer.

Add a new identify\_by option to res\_pjsip\_endpoint\_identifier\_ip called 'transport' this matches endpoints based on the bound ip address (local) instead of the 'ip' option, which matches on the source ip address (remote).

Fixes: [#672](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/issues/672)

This doesn't quite do what you document throughout this. It identifies traffic based on the bound address of the transport the traffic is received on. Within signaling that may or may not be the destination address, if such things like NAT are involved.

Just use pj\_sockaddr\_print instead of differentiating based on IPv4/IPv6.

Unfortunately pj\_sockaddr\_print expects the first argument to be a const pj\_sockaddr\_t, however transport->local\_addr is a union pj\_sockaddr \_(without the *t suffix)*. So I would like to leave this as it is.

### **[gtjoseph](/gtjoseph)** commented [May 17, 2024](#issuecomment-2118041357)

| NOTE: This PR has been reverted because as implemented it created a security issue: [GHSA-qqxj-v78h-hrf9](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-qqxj-v78h-hrf9 "GHSA-qqxj-v78h-hrf9") While it could be corrected by fixing the "if" statement predicate in ip\_identify\_match\_check there are new concerns about the necessity and implementation. |
