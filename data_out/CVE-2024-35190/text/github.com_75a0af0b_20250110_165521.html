### @viktike **[viktike](/viktike)** commented [Feb 12, 2024](#issue-2130454750) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

Add a new identify\_by option to res\_pjsip\_endpoint\_identifier\_ip called 'transport' this matches endpoints based on the bound ip address (local) instead of the 'ip' option, which matches on the source ip address (remote).

Fixes: [#672](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/issues/672)

This doesn't quite do what you document throughout this. It identifies traffic based on the bound address of the transport the traffic is received on. Within signaling that may or may not be the destination address, if such things like NAT are involved.

Just use pj\_sockaddr\_print instead of differentiating based on IPv4/IPv6.

Unfortunately pj\_sockaddr\_print expects the first argument to be a const pj\_sockaddr\_t, however transport->local\_addr is a union pj\_sockaddr \_(without the *t suffix)*. So I would like to leave this as it is.

### **[gtjoseph](/gtjoseph)** commented [May 17, 2024](#issuecomment-2118041357)

| NOTE: This PR has been reverted because as implemented it created a security issue: [GHSA-qqxj-v78h-hrf9](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-qqxj-v78h-hrf9 "GHSA-qqxj-v78h-hrf9") While it could be corrected by fixing the "if" statement predicate in ip\_identify\_match\_check there are new concerns about the necessity and implementation. |
