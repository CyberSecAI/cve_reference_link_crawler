Add ability to match against PJSIP request URI.

Use the 'request\_uri' identifier in the identify\_by field.

| I've updated the commit message to the requested format.  Yep but you also need to update it in the PR description or the issue won't get closed when the PR merges. You also didn't amend your previous commit so now you have 2 commits again. you still need to add the 'cherry-pick" lines ~~and sign the CLA~~.

This should also have test coverage under the testsuite for inclusion in release branches. There are existing tests in the testsuite for matching.

We usually don't have multiple alembic changes going on at the same time but unfortunately, you got caught again. You're going to have to rebase your PR on current master again and change the Revises and down\_revision to 8fce8496f03e

Add ability to match against PJSIP request URI.

UserNote: this new feature let users match endpoints based on the
indound SIP requests' URI. To do so, add 'request_uri' to the
endpoint's 'identify_by' option. The 'match_request_uri' option of
the identify can be an exact match for the entire request uri, or a
regular expression (between slashes). It's quite similar to the
header identifer.

Fixes: #599")`
