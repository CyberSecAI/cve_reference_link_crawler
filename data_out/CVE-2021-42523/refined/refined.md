The content is related to CVE-2021-42523.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sqlite3_exec` function in `libsqlite3` can return error messages as strings via a parameter, which the calling application is responsible for freeing using `sqlite3_free()`. The code in `colord` was not freeing these error message strings, leading to a memory leak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak due to not freeing the error message string returned by `sqlite3_exec`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leak.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during normal program operation when certain SQL queries fail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special attacker capabilities or position needed. It is a flaw within the software itself that occurs during normal operations.
