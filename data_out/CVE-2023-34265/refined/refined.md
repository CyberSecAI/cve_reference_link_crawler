Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing FPJ files within Fatek Automation FvDesigner. This insufficient validation allows for a write past the end of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability caused by improper handling of user-provided input when parsing FPJ files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the currently running process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File/Page:** Exploitation requires user interaction. Specifically, the target must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious FPJ file. This indicates a typical attack vector where a malicious file or webpage is used to deliver the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into either opening a specially crafted FPJ file or visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability when the vulnerable software processes the file. The attacker needs to create and deliver a malicious FPJ file or malicious webpage to the target.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2022-08-26.
- The vendor acknowledged the report on 2022-08-29.
- The ZDI informed the vendor that the case will be published as a zero-day advisory on 2023-05-24, and the advisory was released publicly on 2023-05-31.
- The mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the application.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.8 with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, meaning it requires local access, has low attack complexity, no required privileges, requires user interaction, and has high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
