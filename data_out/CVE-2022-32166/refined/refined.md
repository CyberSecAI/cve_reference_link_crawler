{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An unsafe comparison of “minimasks” within the `minimask_equal` function in `flow.c` could lead to accessing an unmapped region of memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer over-read (CWE-125). The vulnerability arises due to an incorrect size calculation during the comparison of minimask structures using `memcmp`. When comparing minimasks of different lengths, memcmp could read past the allocated memory leading to a crash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to a crash of the software, memory modification, and potentially remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network. By crafting specific network packets that trigger the vulnerable code path, an attacker can cause the over-read.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable Open vSwitch instance and to have knowledge of the protocol used by Open vSwitch."
