- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Auto Login New User After Registration plugin, in versions 1.9.6 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, which allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability. The specific impact varies based on the actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, executes the attacker's intended action within the context of that user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must trick a logged-in user into submitting the forged request. This can be achieved through social engineering or by embedding the malicious request on a website or email. The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
