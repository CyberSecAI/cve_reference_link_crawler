- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress postMash plugin (versions 1.2.0 and earlier) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, leading to redirects, display of unwanted advertisements, or other malicious HTML payloads being executed when users visit the affected website. This could lead to a variety of negative outcomes, including user compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through injection of malicious scripts into the vulnerable input fields of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
