- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability lies in the Flatpress installer where user-supplied input in the email field is not properly sanitized, allowing for injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the email field in the Flatpress installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can inject a malicious payload into the email field during the installation process. This requires the ability to access the Flatpress setup page and modify input fields.
