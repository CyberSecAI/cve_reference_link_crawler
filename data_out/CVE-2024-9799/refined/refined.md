Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-9799:

**Vulnerability Details**
*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the "Profile Registration without Reload/Refresh" application. Specifically, the `add.php` file fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Multiple parameters are affected, including `email_address`, `address`, `company_name`, `job_title`, and `jobDescription`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters. This code is then executed in the browser of any user who views the affected data in the admin dashboard. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the admin interface
    *   Stealing sensitive information

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the user registration form of the application. An attacker can inject the XSS payload into the vulnerable fields of the registration form.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the user registration form and submit a registration request with the malicious XSS payload embedded in the vulnerable parameters. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to register.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerable parameters are: email_address, address, company_name, job_title, jobDescription in the add.php file.
* The XSS payload used for testing is: `<script>alert('parameter_name XSS')</script>`.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2024-9092 but differs in that the input does not need to be encoded, and there is no front-end logic checking the input.

*   The vulnerability is found in version 1.0 of the "Profile Registration without Reload/Refresh" application.

*   The provided content includes screenshots demonstrating the successful execution of the XSS attack in the admin dashboard after the payload is submitted through the user registration form.
