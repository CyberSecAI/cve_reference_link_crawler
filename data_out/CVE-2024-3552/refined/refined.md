- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in an SQL query, which is accessible via an AJAX action to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLI). Specifically, the vulnerability allows for UNION, time-based, and error-based SQL injection techniques.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible via an AJAX action with the parameter `locations_ids[]` sent via a `POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can access the vulnerable endpoint remotely.
