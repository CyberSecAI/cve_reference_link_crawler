- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database, leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or denial of service. The provided PoC demonstrates a time-based SQL injection, causing a delayed response from the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the vulnerable `action` parameter `wccm_get_orders_tot_num` and a malicious SQL payload within the `max_amount_total` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a Subscriber role or a Shop Manager or above role to exploit the vulnerability.
