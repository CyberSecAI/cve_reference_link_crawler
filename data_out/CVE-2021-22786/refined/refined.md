- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An Information Exposure vulnerability exists due to insufficient protection of sensitive information stored in the controller's memory during Modbus TCP communication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information, including application password hashes and project data, through Modbus TCP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain read access to the controller's memory, potentially exposing sensitive information like application password hashes and project data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via Modbus TCP communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the affected controller over the network using the Modbus TCP protocol. No specific user privileges are required on the controller for the exploitation.
