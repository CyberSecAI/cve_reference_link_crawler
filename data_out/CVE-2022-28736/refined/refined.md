Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28736:

**CVE-2022-28736:**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the `grub_cmd_chainloader()` function.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `chainloader` command, used to boot operating systems lacking multiboot support, triggers a use-after-free when executed more than once.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data if an attacker controls GRUB2's memory allocation pattern.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution if an attacker carefully manipulates memory layout.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access. An attacker needs to be able to execute the `chainloader` command multiple times.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires high privileges, indicating that an attacker likely needs administrative access to manipulate the GRUB configuration or directly execute GRUB commands.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs when the `chainloader` command is executed multiple times, leading to a use-after-free condition. This can allow an attacker to corrupt memory and possibly execute arbitrary code if they can control memory allocation patterns. The vulnerability is in the `grub_cmd_chainloader()` function.
