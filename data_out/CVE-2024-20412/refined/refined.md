- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the presence of static accounts with hard-coded passwords on affected systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Static credentials (hard-coded passwords).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
    - Access the affected system.
    - Retrieve sensitive information.
    - Perform limited troubleshooting actions.
    - Modify some configuration options.
    - Render the device unable to boot to the operating system, requiring a reimage of the device.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Logging in to the CLI of an affected device using the static credentials. The CLI can be accessed via the physical serial port or SSH (enabled by default on the management interface, and possibly on data interfaces).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the affected system is required. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
    - The attacker needs to be able to access the CLI of the device.

- Affected Products: Cisco Firepower 1000, 2100, 3100, and 4200 Series running FTD Software Release 7.1 through 7.4 with VDB release 387 or earlier (except for devices upgraded from a release earlier than 7.1).
- Instructions to check for the presence of static accounts using the `show local-user` command in the Cisco FXOS CLI.
- Instructions to determine if the static accounts have been recently accessed.
