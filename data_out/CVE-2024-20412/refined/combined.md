This vulnerability is due to the presence of static accounts with hard-coded passwords on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the CLI of an affected device with these credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the affected system and retrieve sensitive information, perform limited troubleshooting actions, modify some configuration options, or render the device unable to boot to the operating system, requiring a reimage of the device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-statcred-dFC8tXT5>  This advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability may affect the following Cisco products if they are running Cisco FTD Software Release 7.1 through 7.4 with a vulnerability database (VDB) release of 387 or earlier:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 3100 Series   + Firepower 4200 Series **Note:** Devices that were upgraded from a Cisco FTD Software release earlier than Release 7.1 to Release 7.1 or later are not affected.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether Static Accounts Are Present To check for the presence of specific static accounts on a device, use the **show local-user** command from the **security** scope in the Cisco FXOS CLI. The following **show local-user** output indicates the presence of the specific static accounts:  ```   Firepower# scope securityFirepower /security # show local-userUser Name       First Name      Last name--------------- --------------- ---------...csm_processesreportsftop10userSourcefireSRU...Firepower /security #   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + FTD Software when it is running on the following platforms:     - ASA 5500-X Series     - Firepower 4100 Series     - Firepower 9300 Series     - Secure Firewall ISA3000   + Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software   + Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual, formerly FTDv/NGFWv  Details  * There are two methods to access the CLI of a device that is running Cisco FTD Software. The first is using the physical serial port, which can be connected to a terminal server for remote access. The second is using SSH, which is enabled by default on the management interface of the device. SSH can also be enabled on data interfaces. To determine whether SSH is enabled on a data interface, use the **show running-config ssh** command in the CLI. The following output shows that SSH is enabled on the outside interface:  ```   > show running-config sshssh 10.1.2.0 255.255.255.0 outside>    ```  **Note:** If there is no output for the **show running-config ssh** command, SSH is enabled only on the management interface.  While SSH access can be limited by an access control list (ACL), this only reduces the attack surface and does not mitigate the vulnerability.  For more information on configuring management access to a device, see the following documentation:    + For Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), [Configuring Management Access](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/740/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-740/fptd-fdm-system.html#id_10224)   + For Cisco FMC Software, [SSH Access](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/management-center/device-config/740/management-center-device-config-74/interfaces-settings-platform.html#task_42B3A06C70E8415E8C024AE76FE79774)  Indicators of Compromise  * To determine whether access to any of the static accounts has occurred recently on a device, use the **zgrep -E "Accepted password for (csm\_processes|report|sftop10user|Sourcefire|SRU)" /ngfw/var/log/messages\*** command from **expert** mode as the *root* user. The following output shows successful access by the **report** user:  ```   > expertadmin@intel-x86-6d:~$ sudo su rootadmin@intel-x86-6d:~$ zgrep -E "Accepted password for (csm_processes|report|sftop10user|Sourcefire|SRU)" /ngfw/var/log/messages*/ngfw/var/log/messages:Jun 17 16:55:56 intel-x86-6d sshd[48987]: Accepted password for report from 10.1.2.3 port 56261 ssh2admin@intel-x86-6d:~$   ```  **Note:** The **zgrep -E "Accepted password for (csm\_processes|report|sftop10user|Sourcefire|SRU)" /ngfw/var/log/messages\*** command must be entered on a single line.  If no output is returned, the vulnerable accounts have not been accessed on the device during the retention period of the logs. To check the retention period, review the dates that are associated with the /ngfw/var/log/messages\* files.  Workarounds  * A workaround for this vulnerability is available for customers who cannot upgrade to a fixed release. To coordinate implementation of the workaround, contact the [Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC)](https://www.cisco.com/go/tac/).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco FTD VDB Update If a customer does not wish to apply a base software upgrade that requires a reload of the system, they can install VDB Release 388 or later on affected devices. This VDB release will resolve the vulnerability.
