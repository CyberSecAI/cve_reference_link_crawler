Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Duplicator plugin for WordPress does not properly authenticate or authorize users before displaying sensitive system information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to access system information such as server software details, PHP version, and the full file system path to the site. This is achieved by accessing the `main.installer.php` file with the `view` parameter set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can gain knowledge about the server environment, including software versions and file paths, which can aid in further attacks. This information can be used to identify known vulnerabilities in the server software, PHP version, or potentially other components of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `main.installer.php` file with the `view` parameter.
- **Specific URL:** The vulnerable endpoint is typically located at `http://example.com/wp-content/backups-dup-lite/dup-installer/main.installer.php?view=1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the WordPress site.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or authorization.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** WordPress Duplicator plugin versions less than 1.4.7.1 are affected.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4.7.1
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium), indicating a moderate level of risk.
- **OWASP Category:** This vulnerability falls under the OWASP Top 10 category "A3: Sensitive Data Exposure."
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified under CWE-200, which refers to "Information Exposure."
- **Proof of Concept:**
  - Accessing the URL `http://example.com/wp-content/backups-dup-lite/dup-installer/main.installer.php?view=1` discloses system information.
  - Using a debug parameter `http://example.com/wp-content/backups-dup-lite/dup-installer/main.installer.php?debug=1` can also reveal more information.
