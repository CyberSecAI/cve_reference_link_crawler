### @potiuk **[potiuk](/potiuk)** commented [Feb 13, 2023](#issue-1582316328)

File Task Handler should apply different permissions to log files generated by Airflow in order to handle impersonation. This change exposes mechanism to bettet control the extend of permissions granted depending on individual preferences of the users. Default permissions are set to "group-writeable" allowing for impersonation use case, but it can be more relaxed or more limited by configuration.
