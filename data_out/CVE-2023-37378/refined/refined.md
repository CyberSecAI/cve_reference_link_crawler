{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control for the uninstaller directory created by NSIS. Specifically, the directory and its contents could be modified or deleted by non-administrator users, leading to potential tampering or denial-of-service scenarios.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Mishandling of access control",
      "Inadequate permissions on the uninstaller directory"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially tamper with the uninstaller, causing it to malfunction or execute arbitrary code during the uninstall process. It could also lead to a denial of service scenario by deleting the uninstaller directory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system",
       "Modification of uninstaller directory"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have write access to the directory where the installer creates uninstaller directory. This is typically in the user's temporary directory. They also need to be able to create or remove the files and subdirectories. An attacker with a non-admin user on the system can exploit this vulnerability."
