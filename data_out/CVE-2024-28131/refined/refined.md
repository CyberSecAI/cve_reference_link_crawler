- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application "EasyRange" has an insecure executable file search path. When displaying an extracted file on Explorer, it may load an executable file located in the same folder as the extracted file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper handling of the executable file search path (CWE-427).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the running program.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user extracts a compressed file using EasyRange, and then the application tries to display the extracted file in explorer. If a malicious executable is present in the same folder as the extracted file, it will be loaded by "explorer.exe" due to the insecure search path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a compressed file containing a malicious executable and have a user extract the file using EasyRange. The attacker needs to be able to place the malicious executable in the same folder that the user extracts the target file to. The user needs to run the program and extract the malicious file.
