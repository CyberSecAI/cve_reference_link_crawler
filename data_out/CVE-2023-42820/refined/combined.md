# Random seed leakage results in the user password being reset.

High

[ibuler](/ibuler)
published
GHSA-7prv-g565-82qp
Sep 26, 2023

## Package

jumpserver

## Affected versions

v2.24 - v3.6.4

## Patched versions

>= v2.28.19, >= v3.6.5

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability is due to a third-party library exposing the random number seed to the API, potentially allowing the randomly generated verification codes to be replayed, which could lead to password resets.

The affected versions: v2.24 - v3.6.4.

If MFA is enabled not affect.

If not using local auth not affect (admin may be local if not disabled).

To prevent the vulnerability from being exploited, the more details are withheld for now.

### Patches

Upgrade to safe versions:

v2 version: >= v2.28.19

v3 version: >= v3.6.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
