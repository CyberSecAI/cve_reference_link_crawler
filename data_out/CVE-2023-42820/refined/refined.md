```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a third-party library exposing the random number seed to the API.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of the random number seed used in generating verification codes.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially replay randomly generated verification codes, leading to unauthorized password resets.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote, no privileges or user interaction is required, the attack complexity is high.",
   "Additional Information": "The vulnerability does not affect systems where MFA is enabled or if local authentication is not used. The provided patch commit replaces the predictable `random.choice` with a custom function `random_string` in apps/users/models/user.py, and also removes `random.seed()` from `apps/common/utils/random.py`."
