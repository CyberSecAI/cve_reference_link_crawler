**Analysis**

This document is a broad advisory, not a specific analysis of CVE-2017-3395. However, it allows us to extract the following information about CVE-2017-3395 based on its risk matrix entry:

*   **Root Cause:**  The root cause is within the user interface component of Oracle E-Business Suite. The nature of this vulnerability is not disclosed beyond this.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a security flaw in the user interface that could be exploited over HTTP.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to cause "High" integrity impact, meaning they could modify data, but would only have "Low" confidentiality impact, meaning that there would be low impact to confidential data disclosure. There is no availability impact, meaning the system would remain operational.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is over a network via HTTP.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network without needing prior authentication. They also require the knowledge to target this vulnerability and interact with the system in an exploit specific way.

**Additional Notes**

*   The document indicates that multiple CVEs in the E-Business Suite are associated with the same underlying vulnerability, and are fixed in the same patch. This suggests a common vulnerability pattern across various components.

**Summary**

The content is related to CVE-2017-3395, but provides only the risk matrix entry related to this CVE. It lists the affected component, sub-component, and provides information on attack vector and impact. This is more detail than the CVE description, which is currently a placeholder. The advisory does not provide any details about the specifics of the vulnerability or how to exploit it, but serves to notify users of the presence of the vulnerability and urge them to apply patches.
