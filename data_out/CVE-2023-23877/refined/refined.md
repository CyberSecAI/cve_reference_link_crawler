- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pinterest RSS Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject arbitrary scripts, leading to redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads being executed in the victim's browser when they visit the site. This can lead to the compromise of user sessions, defacement of the website, and potentially further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied input within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to provide input that is used by the plugin, which could be achieved by exploiting an admin function available to users with "Contributor" privilege or similar access.
