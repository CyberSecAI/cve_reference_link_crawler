■Mitigations and Protections

OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize

the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

1.  Anti-virus protection

Protect  any  PC  with  access  to  the  control  system  against  malware  and  ensure

installation  and  maintenance  of  up-to-date  commercial  grade  anti-virus  software

protection.

2.  Security measures to prevent unauthorized access

-  Minimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks, so that

untrusted devices will be unable to access them.

-

Implement  firewalls  (by  shutting  down  unused  communications  ports,  limiting

communications hosts) and isolate them from the IT network.

-  Use  a  virtual  private  network  (VPN)  for  remote  access  to  control  systems  and

equipment.

-  Use strong passwords and change them frequently.

-

Install  physical  controls  so  that  only  authorized  personnel  can  access  control

systems and equipment.

-  Scan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting

them to systems and devices.

-  Enforce  multifactor  authentication  to  all  devices  with  remote  access  to  control

systems and equipment whenever possible.
