- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An API key is logged in clear text within the audit log file after an invalid login attempt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clear text storage of sensitive information (API key) in audit logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of the API key, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the Octopus Server instance and related resources.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could trigger an invalid login attempt to the Octopus Server which will cause the API key to be logged in clear text.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to cause an invalid login attempt to the Octopus Server and have access to the Octopus Server audit log file.
