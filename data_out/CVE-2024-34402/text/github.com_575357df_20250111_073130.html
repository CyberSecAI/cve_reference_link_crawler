| During fuzz testing of the uriparser library, we discovered a few potential security vulnerabilities that could impact the robustness and security of the software. These issues were identified in functions URI\_FUNC(ComposeQueryEngine) and URI\_FUNC(ComposeQueryMallocExMm) within the URI parsing logic. We recommend prompt attention to these matters to prevent possible exploits that could lead to buffer overflows, integer overflows, and denial of service.  Detailed Explanation and Source Code Snippets:  Integer Overflow Vulnerability:Location: File: UriQuery.c Function: URI\_FUNC(ComposeQueryEngine) Description: This function calculates required space for query string composition. There's a potential integer overflow when the length of keys or values is sufficiently large, which can result in incorrect memory allocations or operations based on malformed size calculations.Vulnerable Code: c Copy code const int worstCase = (normalizeBreaks == URI\_TRUE ? 6 : 3); const int keyLen = (key == NULL) ? 0 : (int)URI\_STRLEN(key); const int valueLen = (value == NULL) ? 0 : (int)URI\_STRLEN(value);  if ((keyLen >= INT\_MAX / worstCase) || (valueLen >= INT\_MAX / worstCase)) { return URI\_ERROR\_OUTPUT\_TOO\_LARGE; } Impact: This could allow attackers to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code via specially crafted input. Buffer Overflow Vulnerability:Location: File: UriQuery.c Function: URI\_FUNC(ComposeQueryEngine) Description: This function handles the construction of query strings and may write beyond the allocated buffer if the total size of the composed query string exceeds the bounds specified by maxChars.Vulnerable Code:  if ((write - dest) + ampersandLen + keyRequiredChars > maxChars) { return URI\_ERROR\_OUTPUT\_TOO\_LARGE; } Impact: This flaw can lead to buffer overflow conditions, where memory adjacent to the buffer may be overwritten, potentially leading to code execution or corruption of data. Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability:Location: File: UriQuery.c Function: URI\_FUNC(ComposeQueryEngine) Description: The function may attempt to dereference a NULL pointer if charsWritten is NULL but dest is not, which occurs after attempting to write the string terminator.Vulnerable Code:  if (dest != NULL) { write[0] = \_UT('\0'); if (charsWritten != NULL) { \*charsWritten = (int)(write - dest) + 1; // for terminator } } Impact: This could cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service. Recommendations:  We advise reviewing these sections of code to add more robust boundary checks and input validation. Consider employing safer string manipulation methods that include boundary checks inherently. Furthermore, testing for extreme boundary |

| Hi [@YancyLii](https://github.com/YancyLii),  thanks for the report! While I consider myself part of "team security" in the sense that I consider security both important and interesting and that I'd be the first to help fixing even the smallest vulnerability rather than trying to argue it away, there is one problem though: dumping your report right into the public puts me under stress now to fix it in time (assuming there is something to fix, I have not yet had time for a closer look). That's not how security issues are supposed to be reported, please remember that next time with any project, not just uriparser. I made the same mistake once at [pypi/warehouse#2940](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/2940) myself. Usually criticism should be shared in private, but the issue is public so some public response is needed, and a response not bringing that criticism (and statement below) would be incomplete and misleading. I hope that's considered fair, I'm still glad to meet you and this is zero percent personal.  My past months had a crazy deadline and related overtime at work, and libexpat also takes my spare time these very days as replies to my call-for-help banner (added in [libexpat/libexpat@8548bc0](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/commit/8548bc03fdb887c8720f01e95440f1406bd15ffa)) and additional pro-active mails to companies start coming in. So I will not let this potential now-public vulnerability add more stress to me right now.  Whoever sees this post and would like to speed up analysis and a fix, coordinated help is welcome, let's jump on a voice call in German or English to increase efficiency. My profile has my e-mail address to co-ordinate a time that works for everyone.  Thanks for your patience and understanding, and thanks again for being a whitehat and the report 🙏 |

| [@YancyLii](https://github.com/YancyLii) I had a chance at a first closer look now, and will answer in detail below:  During fuzz testing of the uriparser library, we discovered a few potential security vulnerabilities that could impact the robustness and security of the software. These issues were identified in functions URI\_FUNC(ComposeQueryEngine) and URI\_FUNC(ComposeQueryMallocExMm) within the URI parsing logic.  Your report points out three things about `ComposeQueryEngine` but none about `ComposeQueryMallocExMm`. Did you post the complete report?  I'll address the three findings for `ComposeQueryEngine` in detail below.  I created pull request [#186](https://github.com/uriparser/uriparser/pull/186) now for my own integer overflow findings in `ComposeQueryMallocExMm`. Review would be appreciated.  We recommend prompt attention to these matters to prevent possible exploits that could lead to buffer overflows, integer overflows, and denial of service.  Definitely something worth fixing, yes.  Integer Overflow VulnerabilityLocation File: `UriQuery.c` Function `URI_FUNC(ComposeQueryEngine)` Description This function calculates required space for query string composition. There's a potential integer overflow when the length of keys or values is sufficiently large, which can result in incorrect memory allocations or operations based on malformed size calculations. Vulnerable Code ``` const int worstCase = (normalizeBreaks == URI_TRUE ? 6 : 3); const int keyLen = (key == NULL) ? 0 : (int)URI_STRLEN(key); const int valueLen = (value == NULL) ? 0 : (int)URI_STRLEN(value);  if ((keyLen >= INT_MAX / worstCase) || (valueLen >= INT_MAX / worstCase)) {   return URI_ERROR_OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE; }  ``` Impact This could allow attackers to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code via specially crafted input.  Addressed by pull request [#185](https://github.com/uriparser/uriparser/pull/185), review is appreciated.  Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityLocation File: `UriQuery.c` Function `URI_FUNC(ComposeQueryEngine)` Description This function handles the construction of query strings and may write beyond the allocated buffer if the total size of the composed query string exceeds the bounds specified by maxChars. Vulnerable Code ``` if ((write - dest) + ampersandLen + keyRequiredChars > maxChars) {  return URI_ERROR_OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE; } ``` Impact This flaw can lead to buffer overflow conditions, where memory adjacent to the buffer may be overwritten, potentially leading to code execution or corruption of data.  Parameter `maxChars` is under control of the application using uriparser, and the user of the function needs to ensure that the content matches the reality of `URI_CHAR * dest`. I see no vulnerability here, and my understanding is that you needed to point out this potential risk as part of your analysis. If there is an attack vector beyond that, please help me see it. Thanks!  Null Pointer Dereference VulnerabilityLocation File: `UriQuery.c` Function `URI_FUNC(ComposeQueryEngine)` Description The function may attempt to dereference a `NULL` pointer if `charsWritten` is `NULL` but `dest` is not, which occurs after attempting to write the string terminator. Vulnerable Code ``` if (dest != NULL) {   write[0] = _UT('\0');   if (charsWritten != NULL) {     *charsWritten = (int)(write - dest) + 1; // for terminator   } } ``` Impact This could cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.  `write` is only `NULL` when `dest` is. I don't see a `NULL` dereference here, not with the mentioned condition and not any other way. Please help me see the issue if there is one. Thanks!  Recommendations We advise reviewing these sections of code to add more robust boundary checks and input validation.  I believe that pull requests [#185](https://github.com/uriparser/uriparser/pull/185) and [#186](https://github.com/uriparser/uriparser/pull/186) cover that. Do you agree?  Consider employing safer string manipulation methods that include boundary checks inherently.  I don't see how that would apply here or which functions to use instead where, given that we are still dealing with zero-terminated C strings. Please help me understand the idea.  Furthermore, testing for extreme boundary  Will need a sponsor or external reports like yours. uriparser is used in the industry — see <https://uriparser.github.io/doc/users/#hardware> — so these users would be best to come forward to support further hardening.  After review I would request two CVEs from Mitre for this. I would want to use your name for Mitre-internal discovery credit for the finding that pull request [#185](https://github.com/uriparser/uriparser/pull/185) fixes. Is "Yancy Lii" what I should use for your name? |

| Firstly, I apologize for directly submitting bug report on Github last time, which caused you significant work pressure. I am a freshman, and this is my first time participating in software testing and bug reporting. I am truly sorry.  Secondly, I believe there is no problem with your modifications to ComposeQuery Engine and ComposeQuery MallocExMm. Your modifications to the code looks good to me. As for the null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability issue I mentioned, it was submitted due to my analysis error. Your analysis is not a problem, so I apologize again.  I really hope that your project can become safer and more robust .Meanwhile, thank you for being willing to apply for two CVEs for my issue. My actual name is Yan Li, thank you very much! |

| [@YancyLii](https://github.com/YancyLii) I have requested two CVEs from Mitre (through filling form <https://cveform.mitre.org/>) now. I did not pay as much attention when filling the forms as with fixing the issue itself, but it should be good enough.
