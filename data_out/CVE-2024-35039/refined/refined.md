- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in the `tplSys_deal.php` component of idccms V1.35. The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a legitimate user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Specifically, the lack of CSRF protection in the `tplSys_deal.php` component when handling requests for `mudi=area`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions they did not intend, such as modifying system settings. In this specific case, the provided PoC modifies the `area` setting related to an `imgBanner`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out through a malicious HTML page. When a victim opens this page in their browser, and if they are logged into the vulnerable idccms application, the browser automatically submits a forged form request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in user of the affected idccms version to a webpage controlled by the attacker (or embed the malicious form elsewhere). The attacker doesn't need to have access to the idccms server, just the ability to make the user's browser send a request to it.
