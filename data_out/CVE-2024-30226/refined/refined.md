- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress BetterDocs plugin (versions <= 3.3.3) is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection. This vulnerability arises due to the unsafe handling of user-supplied data that is then unserialized by PHP.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow a malicious actor to achieve code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and potentially more, assuming a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain is present.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly detailed, but it involves supplying malicious serialized PHP objects to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
