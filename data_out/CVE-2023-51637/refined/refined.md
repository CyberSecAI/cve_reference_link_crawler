- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied strings when parsing the `NAME` element of the `PATIENT` record within the DICOM service. This lack of validation allows for the construction of malicious SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `NETWORK SERVICE` account.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, exploiting the DICOM service which listens on TCP port 11122 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required.
