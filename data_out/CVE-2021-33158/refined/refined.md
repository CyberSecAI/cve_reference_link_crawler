Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-33158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization within the Intel Ethernet Adapters and Intel Ethernet Controller I225 Manageability firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is described as "Improper neutralization". This implies that the firmware fails to properly sanitize or handle certain inputs or data, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege.  A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to gain higher level access or control than intended.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access. This indicates the attack requires some level of physical or direct access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the local system. This implies that the attacker already has some level of access.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affects Intel Ethernet Controller I225 Manageability firmware versions before NVM version 1.87 and Intel Ethernet Adapters before version 29.0.1.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.2 (High), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H. This further emphasizes the requirements of local access, high privilege and a complex attack, with high impact on integrity and availability.
- The advisory recommends updating to the latest firmware version to mitigate the issue.
