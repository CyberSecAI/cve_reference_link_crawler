This document describes multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities affecting the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server on Cisco Meraki MX and Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices, including CVE-2024-20501.

**CVE-2024-20498, CVE-2024-20499, and CVE-2024-20501: Cisco Meraki MX and Z Series Teleworker Gateway AnyConnect VPN DoS Vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of client-supplied parameters during SSL VPN session establishment.
*   **Vulnerability:** The lack of proper input validation allows for crafted HTTPS requests to cause a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit can cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart. This will result in the failure of established SSL VPN connections and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted HTTPS requests to the VPN server of an affected device.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

The advisory also notes that the vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another and that a device may be affected by one vulnerability but not another. Additionally, when the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention.
