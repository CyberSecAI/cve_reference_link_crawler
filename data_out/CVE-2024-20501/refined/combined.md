Determine Whether Cisco AnyConnect VPN Is Enabled on Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway Devices To determine whether Cisco AnyConnect VPN is enabled on a Cisco Meraki MX device, complete the following steps:    1. Log in to the **Dashboard**.   2. Choose **Teleworker gateway > Configure > Client VPN** in the combined view.   3. Choose the **AnyConnect Settings** tab. If the **Enabled** radio button is selected, the device is configured to support Cisco AnyConnect VPN.  If the **Cisco AnyConnect Settings** tab is not displayed, or if the **Disabled** radio button is selected, the device is not impacted by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Additional Information Cisco Meraki MX Series and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices support the following two VPN services for remote network access:    + Client VPN, which uses Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) or IPsec tunneling protocols   + Cisco AnyConnect VPN, which uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols and is commonly referred to as SSL VPN On both Cisco Meraki MX Series and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices, Client VPN (L2TP/IPsec) and Cisco AnyConnect VPN (SSL) services can be enabled simultaneously.  **Note:** These vulnerabilities reside in the processing of TLS and DTLS packets, so they only affect devices that are configured with Cisco AnyConnect VPN. Devices that are configured to provide remote network access exclusively through Client VPN (L2TP/IPsec) are *not* affected by these vulnerabilities. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:    + Meraki Z1   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software   + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20498, CVE-2024-20499, and CVE-2024-20501: Cisco Meraki MX and Z Series Teleworker Gateway AnyConnect VPN DoS Vulnerability**  Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition in the AnyConnect service on an affected device.  These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of client-supplied parameters while establishing an SSL VPN session. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTPS request to the VPN server of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN connections and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established.  **Note:** When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention.  Cisco Meraki has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  CVE ID(s): CVE-2024-20498, CVE-2024-20499, CVE-2024-20501Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.6CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H  **CVE-2024-20500: Cisco Meraki MX and Z Series Teleworker Gateway AnyConnect VPN DoS Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition in the AnyConnect service on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient resource management when establishing TLS/SSL sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted TLS/SSL messages to the VPN server of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to stop accepting new connections, preventing new SSL VPN connections from being established. Existing SSL VPN sessions are not impacted.  **Note:** When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention.  Cisco Meraki has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  CVE ID: CVE-2024-20500Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L  **CVE-2024-20502: Cisco Meraki MX and Z Series Teleworker Gateway AnyConnect VPN DoS Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient resource management while establishing SSL VPN sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted HTTPS requests to the VPN server of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to stop accepting new connections, preventing new SSL VPN connections from being established. Existing SSL VPN sessions are not impacted.  **Note:** When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention.

CVE ID: CVE-2024-20502Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L  **CVE-2024-20513: Cisco Meraki MX and Z Series Teleworker Gateway AnyConnect VPN Targeted DoS Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition for targeted users of the AnyConnect service on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient entropy for handlers that are used during SSL VPN session establishment. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by brute forcing valid session handlers. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the AnyConnect VPN service of an affected device to retrieve a valid session handler and, based on that handler, predict further valid session handlers. The attacker would then send a crafted HTTPS request using the brute-forced or predicted session handler to the AnyConnect VPN server of the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate targeted SSL VPN sessions, forcing remote users to initiate new VPN connections and reauthenticate.  Cisco Meraki has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  CVE ID: CVE-2024-20513Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Cisco Meraki recommends that administrators upgrade devices to a fixed software release. However, as a mitigation to these vulnerabilities, disabling Cisco AnyConnect VPN will remove the attack vector for the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.  While this mitigation has been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco Meraki has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
