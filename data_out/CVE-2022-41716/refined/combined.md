| On Windows, syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd did not properly check for invalid environment variable values. A malicious environment variable value could exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" set the variables "A=B" and "C=D".  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://twitter.com/ryotkak>) for reporting this issue.  This is [CVE-2022-41716](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mh68-qf2j-8c5g "CVE-2022-41716") and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/56284>. |

`[[release-branch.go1.18] syscall, os/exec: reject environment variable…](/golang/go/commit/aba57b07721cac39b4b7cf70f8dfbf9e2e299187 "[release-branch.go1.18] syscall, os/exec: reject environment variables containing NULs

Check for and reject environment variables containing NULs.

The conventions for passing environment variables to subprocesses
cause most or all systems to interpret a NUL as a separator. The
syscall package rejects environment variables containing a NUL
on most systems, but erroneously did not do so on Windows. This
causes an environment variable such as \"FOO=a\x00BAR=b\" to be
interpreted as \"FOO=a\", \"BAR=b\".

Check for and reject NULs in environment variables passed to
syscall.StartProcess on Windows.

Add a redundant check to os/exec as extra insurance.

Updates #56284
Fixes #56327
Fixes CVE-2022-41716

Check for and reject environment variables containing NULs.

The conventions for passing environment variables to subprocesses
cause most or all systems to interpret a NUL as a separator. The
syscall package rejects environment variables containing a NUL
on most systems, but erroneously did not do so on Windows. This
causes an environment variable such as \"FOO=a\x00BAR=b\" to be
interpreted as \"FOO=a\", \"BAR=b\".

Check for and reject NULs in environment variables passed to
syscall.StartProcess on Windows.

Add a redundant check to os/exec as extra insurance.

Fixes #56328
Fixes CVE-2022-41716

| On Windows, syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd did not properly check for invalid environment variable values. A malicious environment variable value could exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" set the variables "A=B" and "C=D".  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://twitter.com/ryotkak>) for reporting this issue.  This is [CVE-2022-41716](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mh68-qf2j-8c5g "CVE-2022-41716") and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/56284>. |

Check for and reject environment variables containing NULs.

The conventions for passing environment variables to subprocesses
cause most or all systems to interpret a NUL as a separator. The
syscall package rejects environment variables containing a NUL
on most systems, but erroneously did not do so on Windows. This
causes an environment variable such as \"FOO=a\x00BAR=b\" to be
interpreted as \"FOO=a\", \"BAR=b\".

Check for and reject NULs in environment variables passed to
syscall.StartProcess on Windows.

Add a redundant check to os/exec as extra insurance.

Check for and reject environment variables containing NULs.

The conventions for passing environment variables to subprocesses

syscall package rejects environment variables containing a NUL

## Description

Due to unsanitized NUL values, attackers may be able to maliciously set environment variables on Windows. In syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" sets the variables "A=B" and "C=D".

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| On Windows, syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd did not properly check for invalid environment variable values. A malicious environment variable value could exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" set the variables "A=B" and "C=D".  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://twitter.com/ryotkak>) for reporting this issue.

Check for and reject environment variables containing NULs.

The conventions for passing environment variables to subprocesses
cause most or all systems to interpret a NUL as a separator. The
syscall package rejects environment variables containing a NUL
on most systems, but erroneously did not do so on Windows. This
causes an environment variable such as \"FOO=a\x00BAR=b\" to be
interpreted as \"FOO=a\", \"BAR=b\".

Check for and reject NULs in environment variables passed to
syscall.StartProcess on Windows.

Add a redundant check to os/exec as extra insurance.

`[syscall, os/exec: reject environment variables containing NULs](/TroutSoftware/go/commit/2052453072a4e079a5440e162919a88f79c4895d "syscall, os/exec: reject environment variables containing NULs

Check for and reject environment variables containing NULs.

The conventions for passing environment variables to subprocesses
cause most or all systems to interpret a NUL as a separator. The
syscall package rejects environment variables containing a NUL
on most systems, but erroniously did not do so on Windows. This
causes an environment variable such as \"FOO=a\x00BAR=b\" to be
interpreted as \"FOO=a\", \"BAR=b\".

Check for and reject NULs in environment variables passed to
syscall.StartProcess on Windows.

Add a redundant check to os/exec as extra insurance.

Fixes #56284

# Vulnerability Report: GO-2022-1095

standard library

* CVE-2022-41716
* Affects:
  syscall, os/exec
* Published: Nov 01, 2022
* Modified: May 20, 2024

Due to unsanitized NUL values, attackers may be able to maliciously set environment variables on Windows.
In syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" sets the variables "A=B" and "C=D".

Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.19.3 and 1.18.8, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* syscall, os/exec: unsanitized NUL in environment variables

  On Windows, syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd did not properly check for invalid environment variable values. A malicious environment variable value could exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" set the variables "A=B" and "C=D".

  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://twitter.com/ryotkak>) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-41716 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/56284>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.19.3>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.19.3` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Matthew and Heschi for the Go team
