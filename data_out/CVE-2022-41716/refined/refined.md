  "CVE-2022-41716": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2022-41716",
      "Description": "On Windows, syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd did not properly check for invalid environment variable values. A malicious environment variable value could exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string \"A=B\\x00C=D\" set the variables \"A=B\" and \"C=D\".",
      "Published": "2022-11-02",
      "Updated": "2023-07-05"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd functions on Windows did not properly sanitize environment variables, specifically not checking for null characters (\\x00).",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper handling of NUL characters in environment variables.",
        "The syscall package erroneously did not reject environment variables containing a NUL on Windows."
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can manipulate environment variables to set unintended values. This could lead to privilege escalation or other malicious activity depending on how the environment variables are used by the affected application or system.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network (AV:N), meaning it can be exploited remotely.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs no special privileges (PR:N) and there is no user interaction required (UI:N) to exploit this vulnerability.",
      "Affected component": "Windows operating system.",
