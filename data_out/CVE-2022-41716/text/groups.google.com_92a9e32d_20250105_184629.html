Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.19.3 and 1.18.8, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* syscall, os/exec: unsanitized NUL in environment variables

  On Windows, syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd did not properly check for invalid environment variable values. A malicious environment variable value could exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" set the variables "A=B" and "C=D".

  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://twitter.com/ryotkak>) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-41716 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/56284>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.19.3>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.19.3` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Matthew and Heschi for the Go team
