The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `cachefiles_ondemand_copen` function within the Linux kernel's cachefiles subsystem. If `copen` is called with a negative `ondemand_id`, it can lead to a situation where a request corresponding to a random ID is deleted before it is read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `copen` function could be maliciously triggered from user mode, leading to the deletion of a pending request.
- When an object is set to reopen, the open request is performed while in the "reopen" state. This prevents the request from being processed correctly by `select_req`, causing a read request to never complete and blocking other processes.
- The code did not properly handle cases where `ondemand_id` is negative, leading to incorrect object state management.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering the vulnerability. This occurs because a read request will never complete, blocking other processes that rely on the cachefiles subsystem.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user-mode application could call the `copen` function with a negative `ondemand_id`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code in user mode.
- The attacker would need to be able to call `cachefiles_ondemand_copen` with a crafted negative id.

The provided patches fix this vulnerability by setting the object to a closed state if its `ondemand_id` is negative within the `cachefiles_ondemand_copen` function.
