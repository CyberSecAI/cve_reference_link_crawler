| Your environment Latest one Describe your questions In [code](https://github.com/CloudOrc/SolidUI/blob/00d96b53bd0acf082996cef45b0f292eaba22fb7/solidui/spaces_plugin/app.py#L77) here, the open API key is output to the stdout. It could potentially leak the key to unauthorized actor as described in [CWE-532](https://github.com/CloudOrc/SolidUI/blob/00d96b53bd0acf082996cef45b0f292eaba22fb7/solidui/spaces_plugin/app.py#L77). This print is not really necessary. Some logs info or acctch file xxx.log:  ```  <!--Êó•ÂøóÊñáÂ≠óË¥¥Âà∞ËøôÈáå-->   ``` |
