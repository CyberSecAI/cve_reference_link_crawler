Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8252

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the 'template' attribute within the `clean-login-register` shortcode. The plugin uses this attribute to include template files, but it fails to sanitize the provided file path, allowing for Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin does not sanitize the `template` parameter when calling  `CleanLogin_Frontend::get_template_file()` in `clean_login_register` shortcode, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin fails to validate the provided file path, which leads to the LFI vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including arbitrary files, attackers can execute malicious PHP code present in those files. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected WordPress site.
- **Bypass Access Controls:** Attackers can bypass access restrictions and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and potentially achieve full control of the server.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** By including sensitive files, attackers may access sensitive configuration data, database credentials, or other private information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by using the `clean-login-register` shortcode and providing a malicious file path via the `template` attribute.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the shortcode parameters in an HTTP request to specify the malicious template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor Role or Higher:** An attacker needs to have at least a Contributor-level account on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of WordPress shortcode:** The attacker must know how to exploit shortcodes by using the `template` parameter in `clean-login-register`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Clean Login plugin up to and including 1.14.5.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.14.6 by sanitizing the `template` parameter using the `sanitize_file_name()` function.
- The vulnerable code can be found in `clean-login/tags/1.14.5/include/shortcodes.php` and `clean-login/tags/1.14.5/include/frontend.php`.

The provided information indicates that the vulnerability allows for an attacker with Contributor-level access to include and execute arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the template attribute of the `clean-login-register` shortcode, leading to arbitrary code execution. The fix is to update to version 1.14.6 where the file name is sanitized before being included.
