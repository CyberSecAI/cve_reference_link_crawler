```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the implementation of the saveAs method.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious file or page that, when processed by Kofax Power PDF, will trigger the buffer overflow. User interaction (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page) is required."
