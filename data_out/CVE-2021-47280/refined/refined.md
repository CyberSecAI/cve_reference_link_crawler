Based on the provided content, the following information regarding CVE-2021-47280 can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) error in `drm_getunique()` function.
- The `file_priv->master` pointer is retrieved before locking the device's master mutex, leading to a potential use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in `drm_getunique()`.
- Race condition due to lack of proper locking when accessing `file_priv->master`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A freed `master` pointer can be dereferenced, leading to a crash.
- Potential for other memory corruption related issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `drm_getunique()` function through a specific IOCTL call.
- Simultaneously setting the DRM master using `drm_setmaster_ioctl()` from a different process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to open a DRM device file.
- Ability to make IOCTL calls.
- Need to trigger a race condition by calling `drm_setmaster_ioctl()` from another process concurrently with the IOCTL that calls `drm_getunique()`.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `drivers/gpu/drm/drm_ioctl.c` file.
- The fix involves acquiring the device's master mutex before retrieving the `file_priv->master` pointer.
- The patch modifies the `drm_getunique` function:
    - Moves the `mutex_lock` from the master mutex to the device's master mutex.
    - Retrieves the `master` pointer after acquiring the device's master mutex.

The provided content gives more technical details than the initial CVE description placeholder. Specifically, it identifies the vulnerable code, the nature of the race condition, and the steps required for exploitation.
