| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1997184#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-08-24 14:59:07 UTC  ``` A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device (ich9-ahci) of QEMU while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. The bug is triggered on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) in the handle_reg_h2d_fis() function [1]. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.  [1] <https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/v6.1.0-rc4/hw/ide/ahci.c#L1215>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1997184#c2)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-08-24 16:05:53 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1997217](show_bug.cgi?id=1997217 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3735 qemu: ahci: deadlock issue leads to denial of service [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1997215](show_bug.cgi?id=1997215 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3735 qemu: ahci: deadlock issue leads to denial of service [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1997184#c4)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2021-09-03 13:12:36 UTC  ``` Has this issue been forwarde/notified to upstream?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1997184#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-09-03 16:38:39 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1997184#c4): > Has this issue been forwarde/notified to upstream?  Yes, this was reported via qemu-security mailing list. John Snow (IDE maintainer) is aware of it. John, do you happen to have any updates on this?   ``` |  |
