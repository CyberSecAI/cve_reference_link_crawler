{
  "CVE-2021-3735": {
    "Description": "A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device of QEMU. It occurs on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a deadlock in the AHCI controller device within QEMU during a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while processing a host-to-device Register FIS packet from the guest.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "A deadlock condition in the AHCI controller when handling a specific FIS packet during a software reset."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service condition by hanging the QEMU process on the host.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a privileged user inside the guest OS sending a specific crafted host-to-device Register FIS packet, then triggering a software reset.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user inside the guest operating system."
  }
