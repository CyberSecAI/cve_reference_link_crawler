- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting malicious data in a specific data field in the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged, remote attacker can conduct the XSS attack against a user of the interface.
