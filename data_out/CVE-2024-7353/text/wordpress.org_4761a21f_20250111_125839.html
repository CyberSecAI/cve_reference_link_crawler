## Description

The Stripe Payments plugin allows you to accept credit card payments via Stripe payment gateway on your WordPress site easily.

It has a simple shortcode that lets you put Stripe “Buy Now” buttons anywhere on your site for a product or service. You can accept donation via Stripe also.

One click payment via Stripe with a remember me feature. Responsive design so it is compatible with all devices and browsers.

Your customers will be redirected to the “Checkout Result” page after the credit card payment. This page shows them the details of the transaction (the item that they just paid for).

The transaction info is also captured in the orders menu of the plugin. You can view all the payments you received from your WordPress admin dashboard.

The plugin itself is okay, but their policy about updates is wrong. Basically, if you want to get updates of their paid plugins, you have to pay annually. The usual policy for other paid plugins is you pay once and get free updates indefinitely, only support is paid. Imagine this situation: you have paid for a plugin, one year elapses and a security issue or another bug is found. And you are forced to pay because of their bug/security hole.
I have another complaint – they are not polite to customers. They reply in angry, accusative manner to emails when you state your discontent.

The plugins great, it creates payments on Stripe.
I enhanced it with my own php skills to create invoices from the orders it creates and creates a good looking pdf just with a few clicks to review the customer information. I added a few reports to view paid/unpaid invoices. If any one needs the invoices module, please reach out

After starting with WooCommerce and constantly needing to buy add-ons for every new feature I wanted, the costs and complexity just became overwhelming. Switching to Accept Stripe Payments has been a game changer! I can do everything better, cheaper, and faster. The installation was a breeze, product setup is simple and straightforward, and best of all, it’s reliable. I’m never going back to WooCommerce. Highly recommend this plugin to anyone looking for an easier and more cost-effective solution!
