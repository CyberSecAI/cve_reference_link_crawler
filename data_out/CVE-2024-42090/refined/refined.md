- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A deadlock occurs in the `create_pinctrl()` function when handling the `-EPROBE_DEFER` return value from the `add_setting()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The `pinctrl_maps_mutex` is acquired before calling `add_setting()`.
    - If `add_setting()` returns `-EPROBE_DEFER`, `create_pinctrl()` calls `pinctrl_free()`.
    - `pinctrl_free()` attempts to acquire `pinctrl_maps_mutex`, which is already held by `create_pinctrl()`, resulting in a deadlock.
-   **Impact of exploitation:** A deadlock scenario is triggered, which can halt the system or make it unresponsive, causing a denial of service.
-   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves triggering the scenario where the `add_setting()` function returns `-EPROBE_DEFER` during the `create_pinctrl` process. This can occur when a resource is temporarily unavailable, and the system has not set up the pinctrl subsystem properly.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not require any special capabilities. Triggering the scenario can likely be accomplished by an unprivileged user or by a driver loading a device.

The provided patches modify the `create_pinctrl()` function in `drivers/pinctrl/core.c` to release the `pinctrl_maps_mutex` before calling `pinctrl_free()` if `-EPROBE_DEFER` is returned from `add_setting()`. This prevents the deadlock.
