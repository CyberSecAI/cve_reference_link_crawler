- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `reqid` parameter in the `/cancel.php` file, which allows for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-Band SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries through the vulnerable parameter.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the `reqid` parameter in the `/cancel.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and needs to use a tool like Burp Collaborator to capture the OOB data exfiltration. The attacker can achieve this by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint with the malicious SQL payload in the `reqid` parameter.
