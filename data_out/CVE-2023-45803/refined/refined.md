{
  "CVE-2023-45803": {
    "description": "urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 303 \"See Other\" after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because urllib3 failed to remove the HTTP request body when a 303 redirect changed the request method from a body-supporting method (e.g., POST) to GET.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-200"
    ],
    "impact": "Sensitive information in the request body could be unintentionally disclosed to a malicious peer or compromised service after a 303 redirect.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to compromise an origin service and make it respond with a 303 redirect to a malicious server, where a client is sending sensitive data in the request body.",
    "vulnerable_versions": [
      ">=2, <=2.0.6",

      "Upgrade to a patched version of urllib3 (v1.26.18 or v2.0.7)",
      "Disable redirects for services that you aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False`.",
      "Disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body."
