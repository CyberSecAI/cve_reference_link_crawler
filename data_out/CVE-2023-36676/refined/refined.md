- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could execute actions that are normally restricted to higher privileged users. The specific impact varies from case to case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability exists within the WordPress Spectra plugin. The attacker would need to exploit the function with missing access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a contributor or have a similar level of access, which is less than an administrator.
