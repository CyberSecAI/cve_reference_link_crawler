Ah, also we need to bound these by leave time too. Or maybe just delete the map entry, given you won't be replying to anything after you've left.

Interestingly, it still works in this state, since your subsequent join will reset the map entry –so you won't be able to see messages from before your *most recent* join.

Still, I'd rather be explicit and have a test for it than rely on this quirk.
