- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of default credentials in the Traccar fleet management solution's Administrator Panel modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary vulnerability is the use of default credentials, which falls under CWE-1392. This allows for Authentication Abuse, as categorized by CAPEC-114.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation allows attackers to perform privileged transactions within the Traccar platform. These transactions can severely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Specifically, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of system configurations, and disruption of services.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via network access (AV:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interface interaction is needed. The attacker must have network access and know the default credentials. The attacker does not need to have any prior privileges or be an existing user (PR:N, UI:N). The attack requires some degree of automated tooling to function (AT:P).
