Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `id` parameter in the `each_extracurricula_activities.php` file of the Kashipara College Management System does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of input sanitization/validation on the `id` parameter.
*   The application renders unsanitized user input directly into the HTML, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the web page.
*   This could allow the attacker to:
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Display arbitrary content, potentially including phishing pages.
    *   Download malware onto the user's system.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vector:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted URL, by manipulating the `id` parameter of the `each_extracurricula_activities.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `id` parameter.
*   The attacker can then entice the victim to click this link, or include the malicious link within a webpage.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable file is `each_extracurricula_activities.php`.
*   The payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability is: `id=1<ScRiPt>alert(9542)</ScRiPt>`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Kashipara College Management System version 1.0 and possibly earlier versions.
*   The provided source download link is `https://www.kashipara.com/project/php/12746/college-management-system-php-project-source-code`.

This information provides sufficient details to understand the XSS vulnerability.
