Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the direct concatenation of user-controlled data into SQL queries within the `iaDb` class, specifically in the `_get` method and its usage by the `getAll`, `getKeyValue`, and `getAssoc` methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the unsafe construction of SQL queries using unsanitized user inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Malicious SQL code can be injected to modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** In some scenarios, full control over the system may be gained via malicious SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input Fields:**  Attackers can manipulate user input fields (e.g., search bars, login forms, URL parameters) that are then used to construct SQL queries.
- The provided curl example demonstrates injecting malicious SQL via a POST request with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Vulnerable Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is used to build the SQL query. This might be through a web interface or another interface where user input is taken.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs some knowledge about how the application interacts with the database, particularly which parameters are used in SQL queries.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to make the request containing the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable code snippet in `ia.core.mysqli.php`, line 242:
  ```php
  return $this->getAll($sql);
  ```
- The `$sql` variable in `iaDb::_get` is constructed using user-provided input.
- The `getAll`, `getKeyValue` and `getAssoc` methods execute the SQL query.
- The provided curl request is a POST request that attempts to exploit the vulnerability, though it seems not enough to trigger the vulnerability:
```curl
curl -X POST -d "id=1%E2%80%98%20or%201%3D1--" <https://site.com/includes/classes/ia.base.controller.admin.php>
```

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability should be addressed by using prepared statements and parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL. The code should use either PDO or mysqli with bound parameters to ensure that user data is treated as literal values and not executable code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The reported issue is similar to issue #911
- A comment by `@blockisec` states that the provided curl request is insufficient to trigger the SQL Injection vulnerability by itself.
