Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2020-14583:

**CVE-2020-14583: Better Buffer support**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of concurrent access within the `java.nio.Buffer` class in OpenJDK. This suggests a race condition or other concurrency issue where multiple threads might be interacting with the buffer in an unsafe manner.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The core weakness is a lack of proper synchronization or thread-safe mechanisms in the `java.nio.Buffer` class when used in a multi-threaded context.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker could exploit this to bypass sandbox restrictions. The impact is described as "unspecified", which could include arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service, depending on the context and how the buffer is used by the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The attack vector is through crafted Java code, likely leveraging multi-threading, that makes use of the vulnerable `java.nio.Buffer` class.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute malicious Java code. This implies that the attacker could be in a position to provide input data, or has already compromised a system running the affected OpenJDK version.
