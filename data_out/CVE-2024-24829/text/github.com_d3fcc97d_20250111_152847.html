[24.1.2](/getsentry/self-hosted/tree/24.1.2)

[`c63e838`](/getsentry/self-hosted/commit/c63e838a211233e196eac9cb2effc7e7d6603587)

### Breaking Changes

This release changes the memcached backend from `django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache` to `django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyMemcacheCache`. This will require changing the `CACHES` setting in your `sentry.conf.py` file in a manner similar to what is seen [here](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/commit/9936376f4e933781feaae85e0071ef72c7f1c03f). In particular, the `OPTIONS` API for `PyMemcacheCache` is different from that of `MemcachedCache`, and may require changes depending on how it has been configured.

### Security Fix
