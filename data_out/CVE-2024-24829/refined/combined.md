# SSRF via Phabricator integration

Moderate

[oioki](/oioki)
published
GHSA-rqxh-fp9p-p98r
Feb 8, 2024

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=9.1.0, <24.1.2

## Patched versions

24.1.2

## Description

### Impact

Sentry’s integration platform provides a way for external services to interact with Sentry. One of such integrations, the Phabricator integration (maintained by Sentry) with version <=24.1.1 contains a constrained SSRF vulnerability.

An attacker could make Sentry send POST HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs (including internal IP addresses) by providing an unsanitized input to the Phabricator integration. However, the body payload is constrained to a specific format. If an attacker has access to a Sentry instance, this allows them to:

* interact with internal network;
* scan local/remote ports.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in Sentry self-hosted release [24.1.2](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/24.1.2), and has already been mitigated on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) on February 8, 2024.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

[24.1.2](/getsentry/self-hosted/tree/24.1.2)

[`c63e838`](/getsentry/self-hosted/commit/c63e838a211233e196eac9cb2effc7e7d6603587)

### Breaking Changes

This release changes the memcached backend from `django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache` to `django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyMemcacheCache`. This will require changing the `CACHES` setting in your `sentry.conf.py` file in a manner similar to what is seen [here](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/commit/9936376f4e933781feaae85e0071ef72c7f1c03f). In particular, the `OPTIONS` API for `PyMemcacheCache` is different from that of `MemcachedCache`, and may require changes depending on how it has been configured.
