Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the exposure of the 'client secret' within the response of the API request `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`. This secret should be kept confidential and not exposed to the client side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the direct exposure of the client secret within the API response, making it accessible to unauthorized parties.
- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The client secret is not properly protected and is being transmitted to the client side.
- **Broken Access Control:** By exposing the client secret, the application breaks fundamental access controls designed to protect the channel access token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Acquisition of Channel Access Token:** The exposed client secret can be used to obtain the channel access token, which is used to secure the communication channel within Line.
- **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** With the channel access token, an attacker can broadcast malicious messages to the users of the 'TonTon-Tei' mini-app. This could include phishing links, fraudulent information, or other harmful content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Request Interception:** The attacker intercepts the response from the specified URL (`https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`) when the 'TonTon-Tei' mini-app is accessed.
- **API Abuse:** Once the attacker obtains the client secret from the API response, they can use it to acquire the channel access token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or monitor the network traffic of the 'TonTon-Tei' app.
- **Line App Installation:** The attacker must have the Line app installed to access and utilize the 'TonTon-Tei' mini-app.
- **Knowledge of API Endpoint:**  The attacker should be aware of the specific API endpoint (`https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`) where the client secret is exposed.
