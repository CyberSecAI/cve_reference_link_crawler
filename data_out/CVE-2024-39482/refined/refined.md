  "CVE-2024-39482": {
    "description": "The bcache module in the Linux kernel has a variable-length array abuse vulnerability. The btree_iter struct is used in two ways: either allocated on the stack with a fixed size MAX_BSETS, or from a mempool with a dynamic size based on the specific cache set. Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of size MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized iterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.",
    "root_cause": "The `btree_iter` structure, used for iterating over btree keys, had a fixed-size array (`data`) despite being used in contexts where the required size could be dynamic, leading to out-of-bounds access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write/read",
        "Improper handling of variable length array"
    ],
    "impact": "Out-of-bounds access could lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or unexpected data corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation would likely involve triggering code paths that use the dynamically-sized iterators in `bcache`, leading to the out-of-bounds access.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to interact with the `bcache` subsystem, which usually requires administrative or root privileges on the system."
