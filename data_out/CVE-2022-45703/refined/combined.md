The bug is triggered in display_debug_section() at binutils/readelf.c:16319 when parsing the debug sections of a malformed ELF file.  To reproduce this bug, use:  1. compile binutils-2.39 with clang-6.0 and address sanitizer: ```sh ./configure --disable-shared --disable-gdb --disable-werror make ```  2. use readelf to process the PoC file (see attachment): ```sh readelf -w ./poc2 ```  The address sanitizer reports are as follows. ``` === ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x60e0000000e3 at pc 0x5555556ef069 bp 0x7fffffffe040 sp 0x7fffffffe030 READ of size 1 at 0x60e0000000e3 thread T0     #0 0x5555556ef068 in byte_get_little_endian ../../binutils/elfcomm.c:118     #1 0x5555556e88ff in display_gdb_index ../../binutils/dwarf.c:10548     #2 0x55555567410a in display_debug_section ../../binutils/readelf.c:16319     #3 0x555555674606 in process_section_contents ../../binutils/readelf.c:16415     #4 0x55555569169e in process_object ../../binutils/readelf.c:22438     #5 0x555555693930 in process_file ../../binutils/readelf.c:22861     #6 0x555555693d8f in main ../../binutils/readelf.c:22932     #7 0x7ffff6a48c86 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21c86)     #8 0x55555561ba79 in _start (/home/binutils-gdb/obj-asan/binutils/readelf+0xc7a79)  0x60e0000000e3 is located 10 bytes to the right of 153-byte region [0x60e000000040,0x60e0000000d9) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x7ffff6ef6b40 in __interceptor_malloc (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.4+0xdeb40)     #1 0x555555627377 in get_data ../../binutils/readelf.c:498     #2 0x555555672b0b in load_specific_debug_section ../../binutils/readelf.c:15940     #3 0x5555556740ad in display_debug_section ../../binutils/readelf.c:16313     #4 0x555555674606 in process_section_contents ../../binutils/readelf.c:16415     #5 0x55555569169e in process_object ../../binutils/readelf.c:22438     #6 0x555555693930 in process_file ../../binutils/readelf.c:22861     #7 0x555555693d8f in main ../../binutils/readelf.c:22932     #8 0x7ffff6a48c86 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21c86)  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow ../../binutils/elfcomm.c:118 in byte_get_little_endian Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c1c7fff7fc0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c1c7fff7fd0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c1c7fff7fe0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c1c7fff7ff0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c1c7fff8000: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0c1c7fff8010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01[fa]fa fa fa   0x0c1c7fff8020: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c1c7fff8030: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c1c7fff8040: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c1c7fff8050: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c1c7fff8060: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb ```  More detailed causes of this bug is to be analyzed. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=29799#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2022-11-18 01:04:03 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Alan Modra <amodra@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=69bfd1759db41c8d369f9dcc98a135c5a5d97299>  commit 69bfd1759db41c8d369f9dcc98a135c5a5d97299 Author: Alan Modra <amodra@gmail.com> Date:   Fri Nov 18 11:29:13 2022 +1030      [PR29799](show_bug.cgi?id=29799 "RESOLVED FIXED - A heap buffer overflow was found in display_debug_section in binutils-2.40 (HEAD)") heap buffer overflow in display_gdb_index dwarf.c:10548                  [PR 29799](show_bug.cgi?id=29799 "RESOLVED FIXED - A heap buffer overflow was found in display_debug_section in binutils-2.40 (HEAD)")             * dwarf.c (display_gdb_index): Typo fix. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=29799#c2)  Alan Modra    2022-11-18 02:13:42 UTC  ``` Fixed ``` |  |
