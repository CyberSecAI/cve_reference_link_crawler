Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-28877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) vulnerability in the MicroDicom DICOM Viewer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The application is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The overflow may also lead to the disclosure of sensitive information if the overwritten stack memory contained sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the MicroDicom DICOM Viewer application.
- User interaction is required. It is not explicitly stated how the user interacts with the application but it implies some action is needed to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to interact with the vulnerable software in a way that triggers the buffer overflow, typically through specially crafted input or data.
- Remote exploitation is possible due to the application being vulnerable via network access.
- Low attack complexity, which means that the attack is relatively easy to carry out.
