Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in libcurl when built to use the mbedTLS library. When a TLS connection is established to a host specified by an IP address instead of a hostname, libcurl incorrectly avoids using the function that sets the hostname for certificate verification. This leads to a complete bypass of server certificate checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the failure to validate the server's TLS certificate when connecting to an IP address.
- **Missing Hostname Check:** The absence of the hostname setting step when an IP address is used causes the certificate verification to be skipped.
- **CWE-297:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-297 which refers to "Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassed TLS Security:** An attacker can potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack by presenting a fake certificate, as the client won't verify it.
- **Data Modification/Addition:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to add or modify data in transit.
- **Protocol Affected:** The vulnerability impacts all TLS protocols, including HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, and SMTPS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network, by intercepting the communication between client and server.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts the connection and presents a malicious TLS certificate to the client.
- **IP address connections:** Specifically, this vulnerability occurs when the connection is made to a server using its IP address instead of a domain name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and server.
- **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs to control a server with a malicious certificate.
- **Targeted Application:** The victim needs to use a vulnerable application that uses the vulnerable version of libcurl with mbedTLS library.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** curl versions 8.5.0 to 8.6.0 when built with mbedTLS.
- **Fixed Version:** Fixed in curl version 8.7.0.
- **Mitigation:** Users are recommended to upgrade to curl 8.7.0 or apply the patch.
- **Similar Vulnerability:** This vulnerability is similar to a previous curl vulnerability, CVE-2016-3739.
- **SNI Issues:** When using IP addresses, the SNI (Server Name Indication) field isn't set, which can lead to connection failures in some situations.
- **mbedTLS Support:** Not all versions of mbedTLS support server certificate checks for IP addresses.
- **NetApp Products:** Some NetApp products were identified as being under investigation for this vulnerability, but many were not affected.
- **Apple Products:** Apple has addressed this vulnerability in macOS Monterey 12.7.6, macOS Ventura 13.6.8, and macOS Sonoma 14.6.
- **curl command-line tool:** The vulnerability also affects the curl command line tool.
