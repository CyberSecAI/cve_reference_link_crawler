**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2024-1521 and describes a vulnerability in the Elementor Website Builder Pro plugin, which aligns with the CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVGZ file uploads within the Form widget of the Elementor Pro plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input (specifically, within SVGZ files uploaded through the Form widget), allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
-   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly clean or validate the content of uploaded SVGZ files.
-   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** When displaying the content of the uploaded SVGZ, the plugin doesn't properly encode it to prevent the execution of injected scripts.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:**  Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
-   **Malicious Code Execution:** These injected scripts will execute in the browsers of any users who access the affected pages.
-   **Potential for Data Theft, Defacement, or Redirection:** The execution of malicious JavaScript could lead to data theft, defacement of the website, or redirection of users to malicious sites.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **File Upload via Form Widget:** The attack vector is through the upload functionality within the Form widget of the Elementor Pro plugin, specifically by uploading a maliciously crafted SVGZ file.
-   **Network:** The attacker needs to interact with the vulnerable website via network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access within the WordPress site.
-   **NGINX Web Server:** The vulnerability is only exploitable on web servers running NGINX and not Apache HTTP Server.
