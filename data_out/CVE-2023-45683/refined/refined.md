Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of the ACS (Assertion Consumer Service) Location URI within the SAML metadata. Specifically, the `crewjam/saml` package fails to verify if the URI's scheme (e.g., "http," "https") is appropriate for the specified SAML binding (e.g., HTTP-POST, HTTP-Redirect).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper validation for the `Location` and `ResponseLocation` attributes of `Endpoint` and `IndexedEndpoint` elements when parsing SAML metadata. The code did not check the URI scheme against the SAML binding type.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  By injecting malicious JavaScript into the `Location` URI of a service provider, an attacker can achieve XSS within the context of the Identity Provider (IdP). This is because the IdP redirects the user to this attacker-controlled URI after successful authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS Execution:** Successful exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the IdP's domain.
*   **Session Hijacking/Impersonation:** An attacker can perform any actions that the victim can perform. This is possible because the malicious JavaScript can access and manipulate the user's session within the IdP.
*   **Account Takeover:** If the IdP has privileged functionality accessible via the web interface, an attacker could potentially gain control of the IdP's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Service Provider Registration:** An attacker registers a malicious service provider with the IdP. This registration includes setting a malicious URL (containing JavaScript) as the ACS location in the SAML metadata.
*   **IdP-Initiated SSO:** The victim accesses the IdP and initiates Single Sign-On (SSO) with the malicious service provider, causing the IdP to redirect to the malicious location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Register Service Providers:** The attacker needs to be able to register a service provider with the IdP. This often does not require any special privileges on the IdP, which exacerbates the severity.
*   **Control over SAML Metadata:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the SAML metadata for the service provider.
*   **No special network position:** The attacker doesn't need to be on-path between the victim and the IdP.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided commit fixes the issue by adding URL scheme validation to the `checkEndpointLocation` function. This function is called during the unmarshaling of the `Endpoint` and `IndexedEndpoint` structs.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the `crewjam/saml` Go package.
*   The fix ensures that locations use either "http" or "https" schemes for common SAML bindings.
*   The fix includes a new test case that specifically checks the validation of the URL scheme.

In summary, the vulnerability is a result of inadequate validation of URLs within SAML metadata, which leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can result in session hijacking or complete account compromise on the IdP's domain. The fix enforces scheme validation ("http" or "https") on relevant endpoint URLs.
