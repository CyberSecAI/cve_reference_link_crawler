- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `redir` parameter in the FortiOS web GUI "Login Disclaimer" is not properly sanitized, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, in the security context of the victim's browser who has an open session on the web GUI. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a remote, unauthenticated attacker crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `redir` parameter. The attacker then needs to trick a user with an open FortiOS web GUI session into visiting this malicious URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send or otherwise induce the victim to visit a specially crafted URL while the victim is logged into the affected FortiOS web GUI. No authentication to the FortiOS device is required.
