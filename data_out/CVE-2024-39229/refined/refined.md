{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The DDNS client reports data to the server over unencrypted HTTP in plaintext.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transmission of sensitive data (DDNS updates) over unencrypted HTTP.",
       "Lack of proper authorization verification on the DDNS server to prevent arbitrary updates with obtained three-code data."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker, after obtaining the device's MAC, SN and DDNS information, can modify the DDNS domain name to any IP address, allowing them to impersonate the legitimate device or service. This can lead to phishing attacks where users might be tricked into divulging sensitive information or installing malware.",
    "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack to intercept unencrypted HTTP requests from the device to the DDNS server. Attackers can then forge requests using HTTP client tools like curl after obtaining the necessary device information (MAC, SN, DDNS)",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to intercept the unencrypted HTTP traffic or obtain the three-code information via other means. They need to be able to craft and send HTTP requests."
