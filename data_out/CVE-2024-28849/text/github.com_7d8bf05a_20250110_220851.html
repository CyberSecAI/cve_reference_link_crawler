# Proxy-Authorization header kept across hosts

Moderate

[RubenVerborgh](/RubenVerborgh)
published
GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp
Mar 14, 2024

## Package

npm

follow-redirects
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<1.15.5

## Patched versions

1.15.6

## Description

When I was using axios, I found its dependency library follow-redirects only clears authorization header during cross-domain redirect, but keep the proxy-authentication header which contains credentials too.

Steps To Reproduce & PoC

axios Test Code

const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('[http://127.0.0.1:10081/',{](http://127.0.0.1:10081/%27%2C%7B)

headers: {

'AuThorization': 'Rear Test',

'ProXy-AuthoriZation': 'Rear Test',

'coOkie': 't=1'

}

}).then(function (response) {

console.log(response);

})

When I meet the cross-domain redirect, the sensitive headers like authorization and cookie are cleared, but proxy-authentication header is kept.

Impact

This vulnerability may lead to credentials leak.

Recommendations

Remove proxy-authentication header during cross-domain redirect

Recommended Patch

follow-redirects/index.js:464

removeMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|cookie)$/i, this.\_options.headers);

change to

removeMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|proxy-authorization|cookie)$/i, this.\_options.headers);

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
