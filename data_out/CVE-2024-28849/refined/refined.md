    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is caused by the follow-redirects library not clearing the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-domain redirects, potentially leading to credential leaks. The fix involves modifying the library to remove the `Proxy-Authorization` header along with `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers during cross-domain redirects.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `follow-redirects` library incorrectly preserves the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-domain redirects. It only clears the authorization header during cross-domain redirects, but keeps the proxy-authentication header which contains credentials too.",
      "vulnerabilities": "The library fails to clear the `Proxy-Authorization` header, which can contain sensitive credentials, during cross-domain redirects. This is a vulnerability that can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "impact": "Exposure of credentials due to the failure to remove the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-domain redirects. This can lead to unauthorized access to protected resources or services.",
       "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during cross-domain HTTP redirects when a `Proxy-Authorization` header is present in the initial request. If a redirect goes to a different host, the header is not cleared by `follow-redirects`.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to cause a cross-domain redirect, and be in a position to intercept the leaked `Proxy-Authorization` header from the redirected request. No other specific attacker capabilities are explicitly mentioned."
