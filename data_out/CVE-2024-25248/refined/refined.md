The provided content discusses SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Niushop, specifically focusing on CVE-2024-25248.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `DB::raw()` in the `orderGoodsDelivery()` function within `app/model/order/LocalOrder.php`. This function constructs a raw SQL query by directly concatenating user-provided input (`$order_id`) into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the use of `DB::raw()` with unsanitized input.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or escape user-controlled parameters (`order_id`) before embedding them in a raw SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `order_id` parameter, leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (stealing sensitive data from the database)
    - Data modification (altering data within the database)
    - Potential privilege escalation (if the database user has higher privileges)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `/shop/localorder/delivery.html` endpoint, by including malicious SQL code in the `order_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to access the vulnerable endpoint (`/shop/localorder/delivery.html`) due to the checkAuth() method inherited from BaseShop.

**Details beyond the CVE description:**
