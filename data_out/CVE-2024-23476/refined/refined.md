- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Directory Traversal
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is susceptible to a directory traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker to access files or directories outside of the intended path. In this case, it leads to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution on the target system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A), meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment or have network access to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker (PR:N) with adjacent network access can exploit this vulnerability.
