|  |  | # 0.58.0 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## New Annotators |
|  |  | This release brings in three new integrations for our annotator stack component: [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), [Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla) and [Pigeon](https://github.com/agermanidis/pigeon). |
|  |  | \* Pigeon works within Jupyter notebooks and supports a limited feature set but is great for |
|  |  | experimentation and demos. |
|  |  | \* Argilla works both locally-deployed and when the annotation instance lives in the cloud |
|  |  | (i.e. in the Hugging Face Spaces deployment which they recommend). |
|  |  | \* Prodigy is a powerful closed-source annotation tool that allows for efficient data labeling. With this |
|  |  | integration, users can now connect ZenML with Prodigy and leverage its annotation capabilities |
|  |  | in their ML pipelines. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Retry configuration for steps |
|  |  | This release also includes new `retry` configuration for the steps. The following parameters |
|  |  | can be set: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - \_\*\*max\_retries\*\*\_: The maximum number of times the step should be retried in case of failure. |
|  |  | - \_\*\*delay\*\*\_: The initial delay in seconds before the first retry attempt. |
|  |  | - \_\*\*backoff\*\*\_: The factor by which the delay should be multiplied after each retry attempt. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To use this in your code: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```python |
|  |  | from zenml.config.retry\_config import StepRetryConfig |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | @step(retry=StepRetryConfig(max\_retries=3, delay=10, backoff=2)) |
|  |  | def step\_3() -> None: |
|  |  | # Step implementation |
|  |  | raise Exception("This is a test exception") |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | or using a `config.yaml`: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```yaml |
|  |  | steps: |
|  |  | my\_step: |
|  |  | retry: |
|  |  | max\_retries: 3 |
|  |  | delay: 10 |
|  |  | backoff: 2 |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In addition, this release includes a number of bug fixes and documentation updates, such |
|  |  | as a new LLM finetuning template powered by PEFT and BitsAndBytes and instructions for the |
|  |  | new annotators. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Breaking changes |
|  |  | \* The interface for the base class of the annotator stack component has been updated to |
|  |  | account for the fact that not all annotators will launch with a specific URL. So there is |
|  |  | no longer an url argument passed in. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## ü•≥ Community Contributions ü•≥ |
