- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Sumo Plugin <= 1.34 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Through a crafted request, an attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious website which triggers the forged request. The attacker doesn't require authentication.
