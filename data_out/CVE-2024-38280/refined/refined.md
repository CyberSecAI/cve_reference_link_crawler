**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the cleartext storage of sensitive data on the device's hard disk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk (CWE-313):** Sensitive data, including credentials, is stored in cleartext on the device's hard disk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user to access sensitive data, including credentials, by physically retrieving the hard disk of the product. The impact includes:
  - **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data.
  - **Integrity Breach:** Potential for attackers to modify or tamper with the data.
  - **Availability Breach:** Disruption of service by changing the operations of the camera.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** An attacker gains physical access to the device and retrieves the hard disk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the device to remove and access the hard disk.
- **No Special Skills:** The attacker does not require any special skills or privileges to retrieve the information from the hard drive once physically accessed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is associated with the Motorola Solutions Vigilant Fixed LPR Coms Box (BCAV1F2-C600) versions 3.1.171.9 and prior.
- The provided text includes CVSS v3.1 and v4 scores for this vulnerability:
    - CVSS v3.1: 6.8 ([AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))
    - CVSS v4: 7.0 ([CVSS4.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N))
- Mitigation involves applying encryption to all Criminal Justice Information (CJI) data, full disk encryption with LUKS standards, password protecting the GRUB bootloader, and column-level encryption for sensitive database data.
- Devices shipped after May 10, 2024, already have full disk encryption, and devices that cannot have full disk encryption have CJI data encrypted.
