Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-3587:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The provided content from Oracle, Red Hat, Ubuntu, openSUSE, and Gentoo all directly mention **CVE-2016-3587** within their security advisories, confirming its relevance to this CVE. These are all official sources for security information.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the **Hotspot component of the Java SE and Java SE Embedded**, specifically related to "insufficient protection of MethodHandle.invokeBasic()". This implies that the way `MethodHandle.invokeBasic()` was implemented had a security flaw that could be exploited.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core weakness is a lack of adequate security checks in the implementation of `MethodHandle.invokeBasic()`, which is a core component of Java's method handling mechanisms.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to **unauthenticated remote code execution**. This means an attacker can potentially run malicious code on a vulnerable system without needing to have any valid credentials to the system.
*   The vulnerability also allows an attacker to completely **bypass Java sandbox restrictions**. Java's sandbox is meant to isolate untrusted code, but this flaw allows it to be circumvented. This may lead to attackers gaining full control over the system, being able to modify files, or exfiltrating data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the network using a Java applet or Java Web Start application. This indicates that remote exploitation is a primary risk and an attacker can target vulnerable clients from a remote location.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network without requiring authentication.
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious code, which is typically done by tricking a user into executing a malicious applet or java web start application.

**Technical Details (Preserved from the Documents):**

*   **Oracle:**  "This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator)." This implies the vulnerability is primarily present on clients that load and run untrusted code.
*   **Gentoo:** "Many of the vulnerabilities can only be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and java applets." This reiterates the client-side nature of this exploit.
*   **Red Hat:** "Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website."  This highlights the potential of drive-by attacks that may not require user interaction.
*   **Ubuntu:** "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to
information disclosure, data integrity, and availability. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service, expose sensitive data over the network, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3587](/security/CVE-2016-3587),
[CVE-2016-3598](/security/CVE-2016-3598), [CVE-2016-3606](/security/CVE-2016-3606), [CVE-2016-3610](/security/CVE-2016-3610))"

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-3587 is a critical vulnerability in Java that could allow attackers to bypass security restrictions, potentially leading to remote code execution, especially in client environments running untrusted code through Java applets or Java Web Start applications. Patches for this vulnerability are crucial to protect systems from attack.
