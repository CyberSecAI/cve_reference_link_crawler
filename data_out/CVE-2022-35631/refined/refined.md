Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-35631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Velociraptor client uses a local buffer file to store data temporarily. The filename is predictable and stored in the client's configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Filename:** The client uses a predictable filename for the buffer file.
- **Filesystem Race Condition:** On MacOS and Linux, an attacker can exploit a symlink race condition due to the predictable filename.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Overwrite:** An attacker can replace the predictable buffer file with a symlink to another file, causing the Velociraptor client to overwrite the target file. This could lead to data loss or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the Velociraptor client is running.
- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a symlink on the filesystem, which may not be a trivial task in all cases.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink in the filesystem where the Velociraptor client is running.
- The attacker must know the predictable filename and path used for the temporary buffer file.
- The attacker must have local access to the system.

**Mitigation:**
- Use an in-memory buffer mechanism instead of a file.
- Specify that the buffer file should be created in a directory only writable by root.
- On Windows, the buffer file is stored in a secure location with restricted permissions by default and isn't affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects MacOS and Linux systems. Windows systems are not affected in the default configuration.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Velociraptor version 0.6.5-2.
