# CVE-2022-35629..35632 Velociraptor Multiple Vulnerabilities (FIXED)

* Jul 26, 2022
* 3 min read
* [Mike Cohen](/blog/author/mike-cohen/)

*Last updated at Tue, 26 Jul 2022 17:15:00 GMT*

This advisory covers a number of issues identified in [Velociraptor](https://docs.velociraptor.app/) and disclosed by a security code review performed by Tim Goddard from [CyberCX](https://cybercx.com.au/). We also thank Rhys Jenkins for working with the Velociraptor team to identify and rectify these issues. All of these identified issues have been fixed as of Version 0.6.5-2, released July 26, 2022.

## CVE-2022-35629: Velociraptor client ID spoofing

Velociraptor uses client IDs to identify each client uniquely. The client IDs are derived from the client's own cryptographic key and so usually require this key to be compromised in order to spoof another client.

Due to a bug in the handling of the communication between the client and server, it was possible for one client, already registered with their own client ID, to send messages to the server claiming to come from another client ID. This may allow a malicious client to attribute messages to another victim client ID (for example, claiming the other client contained some indicator or other data).

The impact of this issue is low because a successful exploitation would require:

1. The malicious client to identify a specific host's client ID – since client IDs are random, it is unlikely that an attacker could guess a valid client ID. Client IDs are also not present in network communications, so without access to the Velociraptor server, or indeed the host's Velociraptor client writeback file, it is difficult to discover the client ID.
2. Each collection of new artifacts from the client contains a unique random "flow ID." In order to insert new data into a valid collection, the malicious client will need to guess the flow ID for a valid current flow. Therefore, this issue is most likely to affect client event monitoring feeds, which do not contain random flow IDs.

## CVE-2022-35630: Unsafe HTML injection in artifact collection report

Velociraptor allows the user to export a "collection report" in HTML. This is a standalone HTML file containing a summary of the collection. The server will generate the HTML file, and the user's browser will download it. Users then open the HTML file from their local disk.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in generating this report made it possible for malicious clients to inject JavaScript code into the static HTML file.

The impact of this issue is considered low because the file is served locally (i.e. from a file:// URL) and so does not have access to server cookies or other information (although it may facilitate phishing attacks). This feature is also not used very often.

## CVE-2022-35631: Filesystem race on temporary files

The Velociraptor client uses a local buffer file to store data it is unable to deliver to the server quickly enough. Although the file is created with restricted permissions, the filename is predictable (and stored in the client's configuration file).

On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file.

This issue can be mitigated by using an in-memory buffer mechanism instead, or specifying that the buffer file should be created in a directory only writable by root. Set the Client.local\_buffer.filename\_linux to an empty string, or a directory only writable by root.

By default, on Windows, the buffer file is stored in **C:\Program Files\Velociraptor\Tools**,which is created with restricted permissions only writable by Administrators. Therefore, Windows clients in the default configuration are not affected by this issue.

## CVE-2022-35632: XSS in user interface

The Velociraptor GUI contains an editor suggestion feature that can be used to offer help on various functions. It can also display the description field of a VQL function, plugin or artifact. This field was not properly sanitized and can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS).

Prior to the 0.6.5 release, the artifact description was also sent to this function, but after 0.6.5, this is no longer the case for performance reasons.

On servers older than 0.6.5, an authenticated attacker with the ARTIFACT\_WRITER permission (usually only given to administrators) could create an artifact with raw HTML in the description field and trigger this XSS. Servers with version 0.6.5 or newer are not affected by this issue.

## Remediation

To remediate these vulnerabilities, Velociraptor users should [upgrade their servers](https://docs.velociraptor.app/knowledge_base/tips/upgrading/).
