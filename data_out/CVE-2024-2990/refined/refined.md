Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow

**Root Cause:** The `formexeCommand` function in Tenda FH1203 firmware versions prior to 2.0.1.6 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow via the `cmdinput` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow on the stack. This occurs when the `cmdinput` parameter, which is likely a user-controlled string, is copied into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, including the return address. By controlling the return address, an attacker could redirect program execution to arbitrary code injected into the stack. This would lead to remote code execution on the affected device with the privileges of the running process (likely root on the router), allowing the attacker to completely control the device, potentially including stealing credentials, installing malicious software, or using the device as a botnet node.
* **Denial of Service:** A badly crafted exploit could also crash the device due to corrupted stack data, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the web interface which is exposed to the network.
*   **Specific function:** Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the  `formexeCommand` function accessible through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the deviceâ€™s web interface, either directly on the LAN or via a WAN port that is exposed.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint:** The attacker needs to know that the `formexeCommand` function is vulnerable and how to send requests with the `cmdinput` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is located in a form processing function, suggesting that it can be triggered using a crafted HTTP request through the router's web interface, making remote exploitation possible.
* The specific vulnerable parameter is `cmdinput`.
*   The provided information is more detailed than the description found in a typical CVE, giving precise function name and parameter used in exploit.
* The vuldb.com content has a submission ID #301365 which provides additional details.
