- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CSV Injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is susceptible to CSV Injection. This occurs when a program that exports data to CSV files does not properly sanitize user-controlled data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of malicious code when the CSV file is opened by a victim in an application like spreadsheet software.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious data into fields that are exported to CSV files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to insert data into a field that will be exported as a CSV file.
