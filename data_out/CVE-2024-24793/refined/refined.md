The provided content is related to **CVE-2024-24793** and describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the libdicom library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Double free due to incorrect handling of duplicate DICOM elements within the File Meta Information header and during sequence end parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in `parse_meta_element_create` and `parse_meta_sequence_end` functions.
- The `dcm_dataset_insert()` function can free an element, and a later check will cause the same element to be freed again.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption.
- Possible arbitrary code execution.
- Crash of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted DICOM file with duplicate elements in the File Meta Information header.
- Processing a specially crafted DICOM file with duplicate sequence elements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to induce a vulnerable application using the `libdicom` library to process a malicious DICOM image.
- No specific privileges or network access is mentioned, suggesting that the attacker only needs to provide the crafted DICOM file to the target application.
