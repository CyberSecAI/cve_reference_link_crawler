* feat: Add support for allowed proxy addresses

This commit adds support for allowed proxy addresses, which allows only connections from these IP ranges to send a proxy header based on the PROXY protocol. If the allowed proxy addresses are empty, the PROXY protocol support is disabled.

* Update cmd/sshpiperd/main.go
