# Enabling of Proxy Protocol without proper feature flagging allows faking source address

Moderate

[tg123](/tg123)
published
GHSA-4w53-6jvp-gg52
May 14, 2024

## Package

gomod

tg123/sshpiper
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= v1.0.50

## Patched versions

1.3.0

## Description

### Summary

The way the proxy protocol listener is implemented in sshpiper can allow an attacker to forge their connecting address.

### Details

[This commit](https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/commit/2ddd69876a1e1119059debc59fe869cb4e754430) added the proxy protocol listener as the only listener in sshpiper, with no option to toggle this functionality off. This means that any connection that sshpiper is directly (or in some cases indirectly) exposed to can use proxy protocol to forge its source address.

### PoC

You can use a configuration like this in HAProxy:

```
listen w-send-proxy
    mode tcp
    log global
    option tcplog
    bind *:27654
    tcp-request connection set-src ipv4(1.1.1.1)
    server app1 ssh-piper-hostname:22 send-proxy

```

When connecting through HAProxy, sshpiper will log connections as originating from `1.1.1.1`. The proxy protocol data is designed to survive multiple load balancers or proxies and pass through to sshpiper at the end, so it should only be enabled trusted environments. This should be behind a configuration option or startup flag to prevent abuse when public connections can be made to sshpiper.

This is also backed up by [the specification for proxy protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt):

> The receiver MUST be configured to only receive the protocol described in this
>
> specification and MUST not try to guess whether the protocol header is present
>
> or not. This means that the protocol explicitly prevents port sharing between
>
> public and private access. Otherwise it would open a major security breach by
>
> allowing untrusted parties to spoof their connection addresses. The receiver
>
> SHOULD ensure proper access filtering so that only trusted proxies are allowed
>
> to use this protocol.

### Impact

Any users of sshpiper who need logs from it for whitelisting/rate limiting/security investigations could have them become much less useful if an attacker is sending a spoofed source address.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* feat: Add support for allowed proxy addresses

This commit adds support for allowed proxy addresses, which allows only connections from these IP ranges to send a proxy header based on the PROXY protocol. If the allowed proxy addresses are empty, the PROXY protocol support is disabled.

* Update cmd/sshpiperd/main.go
