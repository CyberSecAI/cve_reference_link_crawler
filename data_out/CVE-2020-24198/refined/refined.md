Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24198

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling the 'Brand Name' parameter within the edit brand functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system fails to sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying the brand name. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing user credentials.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out via the web interface of the Stock Management System.
- **Specifically, the "Brand Name" parameter in the "edit brand" function.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the system with administrative privileges.
- **Access to the Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to navigate to the "Brand" section and edit brand details
- **Ability to Inject JavaScript:** The attacker must be able to input JavaScript code into the vulnerable field.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `editBrand.php` script, specifically when processing the `editBrandName` parameter.
- The attacker injects the XSS payload into the "Brand Name" field: `<script>alert("hyd3sec")</script>`.
- The server stores the malicious payload in the database.
- When the "Brand Name" is displayed on any page, the stored JavaScript is executed in the user's browser.
- The provided HTTP POST request highlights how the exploit works.
