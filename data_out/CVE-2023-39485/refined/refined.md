- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Crafted data within a JP2 file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer during parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious JP2 file. The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JP2 file. User interaction is required (opening the malicious file or visiting a malicious page).
