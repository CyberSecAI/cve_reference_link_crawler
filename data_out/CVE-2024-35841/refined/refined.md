The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's TLS implementation when using `MSG_SPLICE_PAGES`.

**Root cause:**
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the `tls_sw_sendmsg_splice` path handles user-provided pages. When a user provides more pages than can fit in the `msg_pl` scatterlist, the code aborts the setup without setting the 'full record' flag. This causes the code to fall through to a 'continue' path and attempt to fit more data into the already full `msg_pl`, leading to a warning when the sender encounters the full `msg_pl` on the next iteration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of the `MORE` flag in conjunction with `MSG_SPLICE_PAGES` when the provided pages exceed the capacity of the `msg_pl` scatterlist.
- Failure to set the 'full record' flag when aborting the `msg` to `msg_pl` scatterlist setup.
- Subsequent attempt to fit more data into an already full `msg_pl`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability does not cause a crash or corruption, but it leads to a warning being thrown in the `__sk_msg_free` function. This can indicate a potential issue in the TLS send logic and may be a symptom of further problems if not corrected.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is by sending TLS data using `sendmsg` with the `MSG_SPLICE_PAGES` flag set and providing more pages than the `msg_pl` can hold. The `MORE` flag is also used to trigger this flaw.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send TLS data via sockets, and must be able to control the amount of data provided using `MSG_SPLICE_PAGES` with the `MORE` flag set.
