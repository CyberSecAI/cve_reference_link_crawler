Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `save_designation()` function within the `Master.php` file of the "Employee and Visitor Gate Pass Logging System v1.0". Specifically, the `$description` parameter is not sanitized before being stored and subsequently displayed, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. This occurs because user-supplied input (the description) is stored in the database without sanitization and later displayed to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the website.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating drive-by downloads.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/employee_gatepass/classes/Master.php?f=save_designation` endpoint.
*   **Form Data Injection:** The malicious payload is injected within the `description` field in the POST data, using HTML tags and Javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the system backend to be able to access the vulnerable functionality of saving a designation. The provided PoC indicates the use of "admin/admin123" credentials.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Application Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the application structure to identify the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided PoC uses an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event to trigger the JavaScript alert, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
*   The XSS is stored, meaning the malicious payload is stored in the database and executed each time a user views the affected content. This makes it persistent and allows for attacks on other users, including those not directly involved in the injection.
