Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2084

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor plugin's lightbox widget. This allows attackers to inject malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts are saved within the plugin's data and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-supplied attributes for the lightbox widget are not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary code.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the user-provided input before displaying it on the webpage, which leads to the execution of injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable lightbox widget.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing user session cookies.
