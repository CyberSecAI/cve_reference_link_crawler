#### **3.2.4** [**Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking CWE-565**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/565.html)

The device allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication and modify the cookie to reveal hidden pages that allows more critical operations to the transmitter.

[CVE-2024-21872](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21872) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

#### **3.2.5** [**Missing Authentication for Critical Function CWE-306**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)

An unauthenticated attacker can reset the board and stop transmitter operations by sending a specially-crafted GET request to the command.cgi gateway, resulting in a denial-of-service scenario.

[CVE-2024-21846](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21846) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)).

#### **3.2.6** [**Missing Authentication for Critical Function CWE-306**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)

The devices allow access to an unprotected endpoint that allows MPFS file system binary image upload without authentication. The MPFS2 file system module provides a light-weight read-only file system that can be stored in external EEPROM, external serial flash, or internal flash program memory. This file system serves as the basis for the HTTP2 web server module, but is also used by the SNMP module and is available to other applications that require basic read-only storage capabilities. This can be exploited to overwrite the flash program memory that holds the web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary code.

[CVE-2024-1491](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-1491) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)).

#### **3.2.7** [**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information CWE-312**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html)

Electrolink transmitters store credentials in clear-text. Use of these credentials could allow an attacker to access the system.

[CVE-2024-3742](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-3742) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Gjoko Krstic publicly reported these vulnerabilities on the internet after an unsuccessful attempt to contact Electrolink directly.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Electrolink has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of the affected products are encouraged to contact [Electrolink](https://electrolink.com/contacts/) for additional information.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.
