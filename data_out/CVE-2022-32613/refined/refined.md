- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Concurrent execution using shared resources with improper synchronization ('race condition') in the vcu (Video Codec Unit).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A race condition leading to potential memory corruption in the vcu due to improper synchronization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation through the vcu component
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs local access to the device with the ability to trigger the vulnerable code in the vcu. System execution privileges are required.
