Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The i-doit Pro web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of input sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** When a user accesses a webpage containing the attacker's injected XSS payload, the malicious script executes within their browser.
*   **Potential for Data Theft/Manipulation:** This can lead to theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.
*   **Fake HTML Pages:** Attackers can store counterfeit HTML pages, potentially tricking users into divulging credentials or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the i-doit Pro application.
*   **Input Fields:** Attackers inject malicious code into vulnerable input fields/parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated users of the i-doit Pro application.
*   **Low or High Privilege:** The vulnerability is exploitable regardless of the user's privilege level within the application.
*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely.

**Affected Components/Parameters:**

*   The following components/parameters are vulnerable:
    *   'Title'
    *   'SYSID prefix'
    *    'Language content'
