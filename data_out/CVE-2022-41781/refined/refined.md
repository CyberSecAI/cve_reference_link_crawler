- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can execute higher privileged actions. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no prior authentication, meaning they can be an external, unprivileged user.
