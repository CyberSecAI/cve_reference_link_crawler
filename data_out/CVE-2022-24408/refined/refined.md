- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A SUID binary (sc) on affected devices provides commands to execute system commands or modify system files. A specific set of operations using this binary allows privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). The SUID binary `sc` does not properly restrict operations, enabling privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local attackers can escalate their privileges to root, gaining full access to the device, including read and modification of G code.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need local access to the affected system. They need to be able to execute commands using the `sc` binary to trigger the vulnerability.
