Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the `sort` parameter, received in the request body, is used directly in the `ORDER BY` clause of an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `sort` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `sort` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be passed directly to the database.
- **Direct SQL Concatenation:** The application uses string concatenation to build the SQL query, which is a known anti-pattern that makes SQL injection possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Modification:** Malicious users could modify or delete data.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker may inject SQL queries that cause performance issues, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary code execution**: Depending on the database configuration, it might be possible to execute arbitrary code on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** Attackers send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to vulnerable endpoints that use `taskService.list()`, `bareMetalService.list()`, `switchService.list()`, and potentially other similar methods. The request body contains the malicious `sort` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. No special privileges are mentioned, so the vulnerability is exploitable even by unauthenticated users, if the vulnerable endpoints are accessible to them.
- The attacker should have knowledge about the database and SQL in order to craft the payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The `sort` parameter is defined in the `TaskDTO` class.
- The `list()` method in the controllers accepts this parameter.
- This parameter is passed to the corresponding service's `list()` method.
- The `sort` parameter eventually reaches the `ExtTaskMapper.xml`, where the value is used in a SQL query within the `ORDER BY` clause using `${sort}`, leading to direct concatenation of the unsanitized user input.

**Example Payloads:**
- Error-based injection:  `{"searchKey":"1","sort":"(UPDATEXML(2546,CONCAT(0x2e,0x717a6b7171,(SELECT (ELT(2546=2546,1))),0x7171787871),9622))"}`
- Time-based blind injection: `{"searchKey":"1","sort":"(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS A, INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS B, INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS C WHERE 0 XOR 1)"}`

**Suggested Solution:**
- Implement input validation and sanitization for the `sort` parameter at the Java code level.
- Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.
- Create a whitelist of acceptable values for the `sort` parameter and validate against it.

The provided information clearly indicates a SQL injection vulnerability related to the CVE.
