Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Broken Access Control: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control mechanisms in the DeltaRM 1.2 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Insufficient Privilege Checks: Unprivileged users can access sensitive information related to risk creation, which should only be accessible to admin users.
*   Direct Object Reference: The application uses the `id_cat1` query parameter to directly access risk information without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Information Disclosure: An attacker (unprivileged user) can access risk creation information that they should not be authorized to view. This could expose sensitive data about the organization's risk management processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   HTTP GET Request: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted GET request to a specific endpoint.
*   URL Parameter Manipulation: The attacker manipulates the `id_cat1` query parameter to access different risk information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DeltaRM application.
*   Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server.
