Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the `id` parameter in the `apply_now.php` and `drive.php` pages of the Placement Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially:
    - Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify data in the database.
    - Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, depending on the database configuration and user permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `id` parameter in GET requests to `apply_now.php` and `drive.php` are the attack vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a modified `id` parameter. No special privileges are required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates both time-based blind SQL injection and UNION-based SQL injection techniques.
- Time-based blind SQLi: the attacker can use `SLEEP()` function to check if their query was successful.
    - Payload: `id=1' AND (SELECT 1150 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))cjwo) AND 'BTUh'='BTUh`
- UNION based SQLi: the attacker can extract data from database by using `UNION ALL SELECT`.
    - Payload: `id=1' UNION ALL SELECT CONCAT(0x716a7a7171,0x7473767843427a464d48514b6e4b464a5365624d71574d7944575573446d62614950505a487a437a,0x7162626b71),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -`
