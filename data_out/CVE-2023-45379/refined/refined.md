- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ajax.php` script in the "Rotator Img" module for PrestaShop contains SQL calls that are vulnerable to SQL injection. This is due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied parameters (`id_product` and `img_id`) before using them in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89). Specifically, the `id_product` and `img_id` parameters are not properly sanitized in `ajax.php` before being used in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front end to expose tokens and unlock admin's AJAX scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
    - Deploy web skimmers to steal credit card data
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, specifically through HTTP calls to the vulnerable `ajax.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges are required. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
