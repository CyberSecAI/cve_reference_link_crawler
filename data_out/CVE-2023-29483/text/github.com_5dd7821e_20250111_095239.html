| As mentioned in the "Tudoor" paper, and presumably in the CVE assigned to dnspython by the authors ([CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483")) the dnspython stub resolver is vulnerable to a potential DoS if a bad-in-some-way response from the right address and port forged by an attacker arrives before a legitimate one on the UDP port dnspython happens to be using for that single query.  While we don't think this is a huge practical threat for dnspython, we will nevertheless address the issue by adopting the recommended mitigation, which is ignoring the bad packets and continuing to listen for a legitimate response or until the allotted timeout for the query has expired.  We will issue a 2.6.0 release in the near future to address this. Because there is a small backwards compatible API change, we are not making a 2.5.1 release with this fix. |

| hi [@rthalley](https://github.com/rthalley) , Thank you for your fix for [CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483").  We tried the latest dnspython-2.6.0rc1 to fix [CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483"). It fixes the skny monitor error, however, it seems to break the dns lookup in k8s environment, keep getting timeout errors:  ``` [2024-02-14 04:20:12,780] ERROR in:25:MainThread: Failed to create MONGO_CLIENT with exception: **mongo-db.ns-mongo-db:27017**: [Errno -3] Lookup timed out (configured timeouts: socketTimeoutMS: 5000.0ms, connectTimeoutMS: 5000.0ms), Timeout: 30s, Topology Description: <TopologyDescription id: 65cc3f5e1adb6db858740ddb, topology_type: Unknown, servers: [<ServerDescription ('mongo-db.ns-mongo-db', 27017) server_type: Unknown, rtt: None, error=AutoReconnect('mongo-db.ns-mongo-db:27017: [Errno -3] Lookup timed out (configured timeouts: socketTimeoutMS: 5000.0ms, connectTimeoutMS: 5000.0ms)')>]>  ```  when I used 'nc' or 'curl', I can see that the mongo db is actually running/listening:  ``` $ nc -vz mongo-db.ns-mongo-db 27017 mongo-db.ns-mongo-db [192.168.152.52] 27017 open $ curl mongo-db.ns-mongo-db:27017 It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.  ```  Does dnspython stop supporting $app.$namespace:$port convention? Is there a get around for this timeout/dns lookup error? ex: $svc.$namespace.svc.cluster.local $port  Thanks in advance! |

| i ran the test code for dnspython (2.5.0) inside k8s container:  ``` $ test-dns.py **test-dns.py:8: DeprecationWarning: please use dns.resolver.resolve() instead**   ans = dns.resolver.query(hostname, "A")  qname: mongo-db.ns-mongo-db.svc.cluster.local. reclass: RdataClass.IN rdtype: RdataType.A rrset: mongo-db.ns-mongo-db.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A 192.168.152.52 response: id 36376 opcode QUERY rcode NOERROR flags QR AA RD ;QUESTION mongo-db.ns-mongo-db.svc.cluster.local. IN A ;ANSWER mongo-db.ns-mongo-db.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A 192.168.152.52 ;AUTHORITY ;ADDITIONAL  ```  The timeout issue might be sth to do with eventlet-**0.35.1**. I have the below 2 lines at the beginning:  import eventlet eventlet.monkey\_patch()  After falling back to dnspython-2.5.0, the timeout issue does not occur. However, snyk would fail due to the existence of [CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483") in 2.5.0. |

| Here's the test code I use:  ``` #!/usr/bin/env python3  import eventlet eventlet.monkey_patch()  # from dns import resolver import dns.resolver  hostname='localhost' # ans = dns.resolver.query(hostname, "A") ans = dns.resolver.resolve(hostname, "A")  print("") print("qname:",ans.qname) print ("reclass:",ans.rdclass) print ("rdtype:",ans.rdtype) print ("rrset:",ans.rrset) print ("response:",ans.response)  ```  we can re-produce the timeout error by the below version:  pip3 install dnspython==2.6.0rc1  After reverting back to 2.5.0, the timeout issue is gone:  pip3 install dnspython==2.5.0 |

| This is not a dnspython issue, but rather an eventlet issue as it monkey patches a function whose API has been extended in 2.6 to deal with the CVE, and which the resolver uses. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/913) there when I released the RC. Note that eventlet must replicate the fix in their monkey patched code in order to be protected against the CVE. |

| Dnspython 2.6.0 is now out. Note that testing in between the RC and the final release found an uncovered area of the CVE, so anyone using the RC should update to get the official fix. |
