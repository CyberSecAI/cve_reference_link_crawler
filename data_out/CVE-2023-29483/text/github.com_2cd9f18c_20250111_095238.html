### **[rthalley](/rthalley)** commented [Feb 10, 2024](#issue-2128505180)

| As part of addressing a potential resolution DoS, we had to add a new parameter to dns.query.udp(), "ignore\_errors". Dnspython's stub resolver in 2.6.0 will pass True for this flag, so the monkeypatched version of dns.query.udp() in eventlet will need to be updated or resolutions will start failing when people install dnspython 2.6.0. I just released 2.6.0rc1, and will release the final version a week from now, so you can test with that. If you just fix the API, then you will be vulnerable to the potential DoS still, as the fix involves ignoring various errors in the receive loop instead of giving up. You can see the revised logic in dnspython's dns.query.receive\_udp() method. Pinning eventlet to <2.6.0 would also be a mitigation, though again with the potential DoS. |

| Dnspython 2.6.0 is live now. I have put up a "pinned" dnspython issue telling people using eventlet and dnspython that the eventlet team is working on a patch and to pin dnspython to < 2.6 in the meantime. |

| I had to do a 2.6.1 because the Tudoor CVE fix ate a legitimate Truncated exception too. I updated the sample eventlet code referred to above to include this change. Sorry about the froth! |
