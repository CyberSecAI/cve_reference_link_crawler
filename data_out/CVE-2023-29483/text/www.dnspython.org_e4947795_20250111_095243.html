## 2.6.1

Dnspython 2.6.1 is now available on PyPI.
See Whatâs New for details.
This is a bug fix release for 2.6.0 where the âTuDoorâ fix erroneously suppressed legitimate Truncated exceptions. This caused the stub resolver to timeout instead of failing over to TCP when a legitimate truncated response was received over UDP.
This release addresses the potential DoS issue discussed in the âTuDoorâ paper (CVE-2023-29483). The dnspython stub resolver is vulnerable to a potential DoS if a bad-in-some-way response from the right address and port forged by an attacker arrives before a legitimate one on the UDP port dnspython is using for that query. In this situation, dnspython might switch to querying another resolver or give up entirely, possibly denying service for that resolution. This release addresses the issue by adopting the recommended mitigation, which is ignoring the bad packets and continuing to listen for a legitimate response until the timeout for the query has expired.
