| As mentioned in the "Tudoor" paper, and presumably in the CVE assigned to dnspython by the authors ([CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483")) the dnspython stub resolver is vulnerable to a potential DoS if a bad-in-some-way response from the right address and port forged by an attacker arrives before a legitimate one on the UDP port dnspython happens to be using for that single query.  While we don't think this is a huge practical threat for dnspython, we will nevertheless address the issue by adopting the recommended mitigation, which is ignoring the bad packets and continuing to listen for a legitimate response or until the allotted timeout for the query has expired.  We will issue a 2.6.0 release in the near future to address this. Because there is a small backwards compatible API change, we are not making a 2.5.1 release with this fix. |

| hi [@rthalley](https://github.com/rthalley) , Thank you for your fix for [CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483").  We tried the latest dnspython-2.6.0rc1 to fix [CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483"). It fixes the skny monitor error, however, it seems to break the dns lookup in k8s environment, keep getting timeout errors:  ``` [2024-02-14 04:20:12,780] ERROR in:25:MainThread: Failed to create MONGO_CLIENT with exception: **mongo-db.ns-mongo-db:27017**: [Errno -3] Lookup timed out (configured timeouts: socketTimeoutMS: 5000.0ms, connectTimeoutMS: 5000.0ms), Timeout: 30s, Topology Description: <TopologyDescription id: 65cc3f5e1adb6db858740ddb, topology_type: Unknown, servers: [<ServerDescription ('mongo-db.ns-mongo-db', 27017) server_type: Unknown, rtt: None, error=AutoReconnect('mongo-db.ns-mongo-db:27017: [Errno -3] Lookup timed out (configured timeouts: socketTimeoutMS: 5000.0ms, connectTimeoutMS: 5000.0ms)')>]>  ```  when I used 'nc' or 'curl', I can see that the mongo db is actually running/listening:  ``` $ nc -vz mongo-db.ns-mongo-db 27017 mongo-db.ns-mongo-db [192.168.152.52] 27017 open $ curl mongo-db.ns-mongo-db:27017 It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.  ```  Does dnspython stop supporting $app.$namespace:$port convention? Is there a get around for this timeout/dns lookup error? ex: $svc.$namespace.svc.cluster.local $port  Thanks in advance! |

| i ran the test code for dnspython (2.5.0) inside k8s container:  ``` $ test-dns.py **test-dns.py:8: DeprecationWarning: please use dns.resolver.resolve() instead**   ans = dns.resolver.query(hostname, "A")  qname: mongo-db.ns-mongo-db.svc.cluster.local. reclass: RdataClass.IN rdtype: RdataType.A rrset: mongo-db.ns-mongo-db.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A 192.168.152.52 response: id 36376 opcode QUERY rcode NOERROR flags QR AA RD ;QUESTION mongo-db.ns-mongo-db.svc.cluster.local. IN A ;ANSWER mongo-db.ns-mongo-db.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A 192.168.152.52 ;AUTHORITY ;ADDITIONAL  ```  The timeout issue might be sth to do with eventlet-**0.35.1**. I have the below 2 lines at the beginning:  import eventlet eventlet.monkey\_patch()  After falling back to dnspython-2.5.0, the timeout issue does not occur. However, snyk would fail due to the existence of [CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483") in 2.5.0. |

| This is not a dnspython issue, but rather an eventlet issue as it monkey patches a function whose API has been extended in 2.6 to deal with the CVE, and which the resolver uses. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/913) there when I released the RC. Note that eventlet must replicate the fix in their monkey patched code in order to be protected against the CVE. |

| Dnspython 2.6.0 is now out. Note that testing in between the RC and the final release found an uncovered area of the CVE, so anyone using the RC should update to get the official fix. |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-930af3332f
2024-05-03 01:40:26.180419
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python-dns
Product : Fedora 40
Version : 2.6.1
Release : 1.fc40
URL : <http://www.dnspython.org>
Summary : DNS toolkit for Python
Description :
dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record
types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
updates. It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.

dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
class, and return an answer set. The low level classes allow direct
manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.

[v2.6.0](/rthalley/dnspython/tree/v2.6.0)

[`cecb853`](/rthalley/dnspython/commit/cecb8534f61de16aaa1a1a84eaaeb14dfdf67448)

See [What's New](https://dnspython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html) for details.

This release addresses the potential DoS issue discussed in the "TuDoor" paper ([CVE-2023-29483](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc "CVE-2023-29483")). The dnspython stub resolver is vulnerable to a potential DoS if a bad-in-some-way response from the right address and port forged by an attacker arrives before a legitimate one on the UDP port dnspython is using for that query. In this situation, dnspython might switch to querying another resolver or give up entirely, possibly denying service for that resolution. This release addresses the issue by adopting the recommended mitigation, which is ignoring the bad packets and continuing to listen for a legitimate response until the timeout for the query has expired.

Thank you to all the contributors to this release, and, as usual, thanks to my co-maintainers: Tomáš Křížek, Petr Špaček, and Brian Wellington.

## 2.6.1

Dnspython 2.6.1 is now available on PyPI.
See Whatâs New for details.
This is a bug fix release for 2.6.0 where the âTuDoorâ fix erroneously suppressed legitimate Truncated exceptions. This caused the stub resolver to timeout instead of failing over to TCP when a legitimate truncated response was received over UDP.
This release addresses the potential DoS issue discussed in the âTuDoorâ paper (CVE-2023-29483). The dnspython stub resolver is vulnerable to a potential DoS if a bad-in-some-way response from the right address and port forged by an attacker arrives before a legitimate one on the UDP port dnspython is using for that query. In this situation, dnspython might switch to querying another resolver or give up entirely, possibly denying service for that resolution. This release addresses the issue by adopting the recommended mitigation, which is ignoring the bad packets and continuing to listen for a legitimate response until the timeout for the query has expired.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-bbd76d7c63
2024-05-10 01:33:48.476433
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python-dns
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 2.3.0
Release : 3.fc38
URL : <http://www.dnspython.org>
Summary : DNS toolkit for Python
Description :
dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record
types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
updates. It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.

dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
class, and return an answer set. The low level classes allow direct
manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.

Name : python-dns
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 2.6.1
Release : 1.fc39
URL : <http://www.dnspython.org>
Summary : DNS toolkit for Python
Description :
dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record
types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
updates. It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.

dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
class, and return an answer set. The low level classes allow direct
manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.

#### Introduced: 9 Feb 2024

[CVE-2023-29483  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29483) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-696  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/696.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `dnspython` to version 2.6.1 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Behavior Order in the DNS pre-processing pipeline, which allows an off-path attacker who can spoof the source IP address of a malformed DNS response packet to cause denial of service. The UDP processing functions in `query.py` and `asyncquery.py` accept the first-arriving packet before closing the receiving socket, allowing the attacker to make the remote nameserver appear unavailable for the target resolver and clients.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.9 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

| As part of addressing a potential resolution DoS, we had to add a new parameter to dns.query.udp(), "ignore\_errors". Dnspython's stub resolver in 2.6.0 will pass True for this flag, so the monkeypatched version of dns.query.udp() in eventlet will need to be updated or resolutions will start failing when people install dnspython 2.6.0. I just released 2.6.0rc1, and will release the final version a week from now, so you can test with that. If you just fix the API, then you will be vulnerable to the potential DoS still, as the fix involves ignoring various errors in the receive loop instead of giving up. You can see the revised logic in dnspython's dns.query.receive\_udp() method. Pinning eventlet to <2.6.0 would also be a mitigation, though again with the potential DoS. |

| Dnspython 2.6.0 is live now. I have put up a "pinned" dnspython issue telling people using eventlet and dnspython that the eventlet team is working on a patch and to pin dnspython to < 2.6 in the meantime. |

| I had to do a 2.6.1 because the Tudoor CVE fix ate a legitimate Truncated exception too. I updated the sample eventlet code referred to above to include this change. Sorry about the froth! |
