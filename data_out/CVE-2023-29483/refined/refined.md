  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The dnspython stub resolver is vulnerable to a potential DoS if a bad-in-some-way response from the right address and port forged by an attacker arrives before a legitimate one on the UDP port dnspython happens to be using for that single query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect Behavior Order in the DNS pre-processing pipeline"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The resolver might switch to querying another resolver or give up entirely, possibly denying service for that resolution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Off-path attacker spoofing the source IP address of a malformed DNS response packet"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to spoof the source IP address of a malformed DNS response packet. The attacker must also be able to make this malicious packet arrive before the legitimate response."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "mitigation": "The recommended mitigation is ignoring the bad packets and continuing to listen for a legitimate response or until the allotted timeout for the query has expired.",
    "eventlet_impact": "The vulnerability fix in dnspython required a change to the API of `dns.query.udp()`, introducing a new `ignore_errors` parameter. This caused compatibility issues with `eventlet`'s monkey patching, resulting in resolution failures. Eventlet had to be updated to handle the new parameter and replicate the fix."
