- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the session handling mechanism of the web server running on Juniper SRX/EX devices. This overflow occurs due to the use of the insecure `strcat` function when concatenating data into a buffer during session negotiation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow.
    - Use of insecure `strcat` function.
    - Lack of exploit mitigation techniques in the tested versions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote, unauthenticated root code execution. An attacker can gain full control of the vulnerable device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to the web server, triggering the overflow in the `httpd_gk_session_update()` function. The vulnerable code is in the session handling mechanism and can be reached pre-authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable device's web server. No prior authentication is required.
