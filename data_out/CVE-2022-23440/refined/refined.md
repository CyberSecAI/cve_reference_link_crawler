- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiEDR collectors utilize a hardcoded cryptographic key in their registration mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321) within the FortiEDR collector registration process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disable and uninstall the FortiEDR collectors from endpoints within the same deployment. This effectively leads to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the affected endpoint where the FortiEDR collector is installed.
