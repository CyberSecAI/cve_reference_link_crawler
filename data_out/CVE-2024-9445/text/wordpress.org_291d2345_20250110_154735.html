Plugin works as advertised but the list view doesn‚Äôt show images, which is a deal-breaker for what I need to do. And the carousel option is what ConversionX would call a ‚Äúconversion killer‚Äù:
https://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/
Images\* in the list view would make this plugin mostly perfect. Then again, I like to roll my own CSS, so slightly less technical people might not like the lack of formatting options, like the ability to hide the extra lines.
\*Images meaning large, actual-size images that we can resize in CSS or otherwise if we want, instead of simply displaying smaller thumbnails. The now-defunct ‚ÄúHungryfeed‚Äù plugin is a perfect example.

Just getting started with this plugin. It‚Äôs very simple, displaying 3 posts with a shortcode. Not many offerings out there as far as Medium + WordPress integration, this is a great start. Kudos.
