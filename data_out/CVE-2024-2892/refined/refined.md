Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetCfm` function of Tenda AC7 V1.0 firmware, specifically version V15.03.06.44.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `formSetCfm` function takes the `funcpara1` parameter from a POST request.
- This `funcpara1` parameter is passed to the `save_list_data` function.
- Inside `save_list_data`, the `sprintf` function is used to format a string and store it in a fixed-size array `mib_name` (64 bytes).
- The `sprintf` function uses user-controlled data from `funcpara1` as part of the formatted string, creating a vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack due to insufficient input validation, which can lead to code execution by overwriting the return address.
- This could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setcfm` endpoint.
- The attacker controls the `funcpara1` parameter in the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tenda AC7 router.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in `save_list_data` where `sprintf(mib_name, "%s.list%d", list_name, counta);` is used.
- `list_name` is derived from the user controlled parameter `funcpara1`.
- The `mib_name` buffer is a fixed size of 64 bytes.
- The PoC shows a Python script sending a POST request with a payload of `b'a'*0x500` for the `funcpara1` parameter to trigger the overflow.
