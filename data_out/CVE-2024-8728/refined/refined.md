- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the use of `add_query_arg` without proper escaping on the URL within the Easy Load More WordPress plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. If a user is tricked into clicking a malicious link, the injected script will execute within the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads. They must then trick a user into visiting the malicious URL (e.g., through phishing, social engineering).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers do not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to craft malicious URLs and trick users into clicking on them.
