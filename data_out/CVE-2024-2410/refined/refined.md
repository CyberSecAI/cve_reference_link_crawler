- Root cause of vulnerability: A malicious JSON input could cause the parser to copy data that has already been freed into an error message.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free vulnerability in the C++ JSON parser.
- Impact of exploitation: In certain situations, a malicious JSON input could cause the parser to copy data that has already been freed into an error message, potentially leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.
- Attack vectors: A specially crafted JSON input provided to the C++ JSON parser.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the C++ JSON parser, specifically through a stream with separate chunks rather than a contiguous array.
