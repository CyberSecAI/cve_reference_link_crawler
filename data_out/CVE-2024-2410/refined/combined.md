# Announcements

* This release fixes **[CVE-2024-2410](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h86c-v8g6-46f2 "CVE-2024-2410")** (note: there may be a delay in the publication of this CVE number), a minor vulnerability in the C++ JSON parser. In certain situations, a malicious JSON input could cause the parser to copy data that has already been freed into an error message. This can only happen if the code is parsing from a stream with separate chunks rather than a contiguous array. The bug was introduced in 4.22.0 and was fixed with [b955165](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/b955165ebdcc5a8ba9c267230d6305f4e3d9c118) in 4.25.0 and up.
* [Protobuf News](https://protobuf.dev/news/) may include additional announcements or pre-announcements for upcoming changes.
