Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0685

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Ninja Forms Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable due to the direct insertion of a user-provided email address into a raw SQL query without proper sanitization or using prepared statements. Specifically, the `get_subs_by_email` function is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `get_subs_by_email` function when handling the email address during a data export request. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code by including malicious SQL syntax within the email address field. This is an example of a second-order SQL injection, where the vulnerability is not exploited at the point of data input, but later during processing.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code uses string concatenation to build the SQL query instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive data, potentially including all user data stored by the plugin.
- **Privacy Risk:** Due to the nature of the attack, a successful exploit can lead to a significant privacy violation, as all the information collected through the forms can be accessed.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information by manipulating the SQL query to return data from other tables.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Email Address:** An attacker crafts a malicious email address containing SQL injection payloads. For example, using single quotes to escape string boundaries in the SQL query. An example malicious email would look like `QuiRkyEmAil'/**/OR/**/1!='@stealthcopter.com`
- **Data Export Request:** The attack is triggered when a WordPress administrator initiates a data export request for a user whose email address was crafted to include the malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't need to be logged in to submit a form with a malicious email address
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint in the plugin and how to craft a malicious email address.
- **Indirect access:** The attacker does not directly cause the SQL execution, but has to rely on an admin user to trigger a data export request to execute the malicious SQL, which makes this a second order SQL injection.
- **Admin user trigger:** The admin has to trigger a user data export for this exploit to work.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Ninja Forms Contact Form plugin versions 3.7.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.7.2 by using prepared statements.
- The `is_email` function in WordPress will reject emails with single quotes however `sanitize_email` allows them.
- While the vulnerability requires an admin user to trigger the export process, this may be required due to GDPR regulations.
