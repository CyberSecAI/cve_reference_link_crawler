Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

**Root Cause:** The WP Photo Album Plus plugin (versions <= 8.5.02.005) is vulnerable to IDOR. This means the plugin uses direct references to objects (like files, folders, or database entries) without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks, which is a violation of access control principles.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References:** The plugin uses direct references to objects without verifying if the user is authorized to access/modify them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could bypass authorization and access sensitive files or folders.
*   An attacker could interact with the database potentially reading or modifying sensitive information
*   The specific impact varies on a case by case basis

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited by directly manipulating object references in requests to the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker does not need to authenticate, therefore an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, classified as low severity, and is unlikely to be exploited.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 8.6.01.003
*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A1: Broken Access Control
*   The vulnerability was reported by Kyle Sanchez
