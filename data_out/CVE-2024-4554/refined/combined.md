* End-to-end application configuration workflow
* Revamp of centralized administration tasks

* Pagination

### 1.2 Removal of iManager Framework

### 1.3 Enhanced REST APIs

The Administration Console interface is built using the REST API architectural approach. You can use the REST APIs to automate the Identity Server configurations. This release also introduces the Try it out option with Swagger API for you to test.

The Swagger documentation is available in Administration Console. To access it, use your Administration Console hostname and port in the following format:

https://<admin-console-host>:<admin-console-port>/nps/swagger-ui.html

### 1.4 Auditing of Configuration Changes

This release introduces the auditing of administrator configuration changes.

### 1.5 A New Authentication Class to Encrypt the User Password

This release introduces a new custom authentication class, SecureCredentialsAuthClass. Using this class, you can encrypt the user password before sending it to Identity Server. This authentication class uses [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto) for password text encryption from the front end during login.

For more information, see [SecureCredentialsAuthClass](../admin/securecredentialsauth.html#securecredentialsauth).

*NOTE:*The Administration Console interface does not contain Liberty in Access Manager 5.1. You can configure Liberty only through APIs.

### 1.8 Branding Updates

Micro Focus is now part of OpenText. To adhere to the OpenText brand, the name of the product, its components and user interfaces, logos, company name references, and documentation are updated. The OpenText versioning mechanism uses the CY.Q (Calendar Year.Quarter) format. Starting from the 5.1 release, Access Manager adheres to the OpenText versioning convention.
