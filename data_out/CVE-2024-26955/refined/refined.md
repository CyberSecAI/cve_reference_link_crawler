{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `nilfs_get_block()` function in the NILFS2 filesystem could inconsistently return success even when both searching for and inserting a block failed. This inconsistent behavior can occur due to an unexpected race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent return status from nilfs_get_block() leading to a race condition."
    ],
    "impact": "If `nilfs_get_block()` returns success incorrectly, callers like `__block_write_begin_int()` might request a read into a buffer that is not mapped, which would trigger a BUG_ON check in `submit_bh_wbc()` due to the `BH_Mapped` flag not being set. This leads to a kernel panic.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through normal file system operations that involve writing to disk blocks managed by the nilfs2 file system.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to trigger write operations on a file system using the nilfs2 filesystem driver, thus needing local access to the system or remote access through a service that uses the nilfs2 file system."
