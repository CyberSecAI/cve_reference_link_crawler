## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v4 8.8**
* **ATTENTION**: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor**: Siemens
* **Equipment**: IEC 61850 Client libraries from Triangle MicroWorks affecting SICAM and SITIPE products
* **Vulnerability**: Classic Buffer Overflow

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial-of-service condition by sending specially crafted MMS messages.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Siemens products are affected:

* SICAM A8000 Device Firmware ETI5 Ethernet Int. 1x100TX IEC61850: All versions prior to V05.30
* SICAM EGS Device Firmware ETI5: All versions prior to V05.30
* SICAM 8 Software Solution: ETI5 All versions prior to V05.30

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)

The IEC 61850 Client libraries as integrated in affected products improperly check buffer sizes when processing received MMS messages. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition by sending specially crafted MMS messages.

[CVE-2024-34057](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34057) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2024-34057](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34057). A base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:

* SICAM SCC: Update to [V10.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109973586/)
* ETI5 Ethernet Int. 1x100TX IEC61850: Update to [V05.30 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804985/) . The firmware ETI5 V5.30 is present within "CP-8031/CP-8050 Package" V5.30

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.
