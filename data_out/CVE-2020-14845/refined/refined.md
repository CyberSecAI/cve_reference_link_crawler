      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The specific root cause of this vulnerability is not detailed in the provided document.",
        "weaknesses": "The document only mentions that MySQL Server versions prior to 8.0.21 are vulnerable.  It appears to be related to the server's optimizer.",
        "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service by causing the server to hang or crash.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the MySQL protocol.",
         "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the MySQL server. No authentication is specifically required to trigger the vulnerability, however, exploitation might be tied to specific SQL operations which require prior connection."
