Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `processscore.php` file of the "Learning Management System Project In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0.
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the "LessonID" parameter before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The application fails to validate and sanitize user input, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:**  Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain comprehensive control of the system.
- **Service Interruption:**  Exploitation can lead to service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `processscore.php`.
- **"LessonID" Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the `LessonID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:**  Attackers only need to be registered users of the system. No special privileges are required.
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using both time-based blind and boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) includes an example of a malicious POST request and demonstrates the usage of SQLmap to identify the vulnerability.
- The content includes a suggestion for fixing the vulnerability, which includes using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
