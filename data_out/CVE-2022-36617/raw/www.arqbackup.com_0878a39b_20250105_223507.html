<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.31.0.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">Aug 15, 2024</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Modified Arq to prevent any changes to its internal database or any backup data if the license isn't compatible with the product version so that someone who accidentally installs a newer version not compatible with their license can easily switch back to the older version.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.30.3.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">Aug 1, 2024</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If you add a mount-point type reparse point as a folder to be backed up in your backup plan, Arq will traverse the reparse point and back up the contents of that volume. Reparse points within it are still backed up as reparse points (not traversed). This was added to enable backing up of volumes mounted in NTFS without a drive letter.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.30.2.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">July 29, 2024</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue where exporting file selections from an AWS backup plan and then importing them to a non-AWS backup plan could result in a backup plan configured with invalid storage classes.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.30.0.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">July 22, 2024</p>
<h2>New Feature</h2>

    <li>Added integration with <a href="https://pcloud.com">pCloud</a>. Pick "New Storage Location" from Arq's File menu, choose pCloud, and follow the prompts to add your pCloud account as a storage location for your backup data. Then pick "New Backup Plan" from Arq's File menu, choose that pCloud storage location, and follow the prompts to create your backup plan.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.29.0.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">July 8, 2024</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reduced the list of OAuth permissions requested when connecting to Google Drive in order to meet Google's new security requirements. Arq can now only access files that Arq created in the Google Drive account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for SFTP 'none' authentication type to allow use with SFTP services like TailScale. Enter an SFTP location with a blank password and Arq will automatically detect the server allows 'none' authentication and will use that.</li>
</ul>



<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.27.8.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">May 3, 2024</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue where a file that was "Deleted/Kept" (because the backup plan's settings included keeping deleted files in subseequent backup records) which subsequently reappeared was still shown as "Deleted/Kept".</li>
</ul>



<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.27.7.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">March 29, 2024</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue where Arq would show a Google error 'unauthorized_client' instead of prompting to grant access.</li>
    <li>When launched, Arq attempts to check whether OAuth tokens are valid, and prompts to grant access for any token that isn't valid.</li>
    <li>Arq checks whether the authorized Google Cloud Storage OAuth token actually has access to the data, not just that it's a valid token, and prompts to grant access if not.</li>
</ul>



<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.27.3.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">March 27, 2024</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented a workaround for Google Cloud OAuth because of Google's changes to OAuth scope permissions which was causing "app is blocked" errors.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where, if a backup was started and then immediately stopped, changed files wouldn't be backed up the next time a backup runs.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where, when applying 'thinning' retention rules, Arq always kept the oldest backup record no matter the retention rules.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.27.0.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">February 23, 2024</p>

    <li>Fixed an issue where backups of a folder wouldn't appear on the web site if the folder wasn't available at backup time. Arq now shows the most recent backup record of the folder.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.25.19.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">January 1, 2024</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Changed Google Drive remove-item behavior from moving to trash back to permanently deleting due to multiple customer complaints of Google not freeing up quota.</li>
   <li>Fixed an issue which could cause errors when reading reparse points.</li>
</ul>



<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.25.10.0</h1>

</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.25.9.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">October 21, 2023</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>

</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.25.5.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">October 17, 2023</p>

</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.25.1.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">October 16, 2023</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Fixed an issue which could cause an error during 'thinning' of backups for a backup plan where folders have been added and removed in the past.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.25.0.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">October 13, 2023</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for ap-southeast-4 and il-central-1 AWS regions.</li>
    <li>Added 'Apply Retention Rules' menu item so you can apply the rules without doing a backup first.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.24.4.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">October 4, 2023</p>

</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.24.3.0</h1>

</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.24.2.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">September 25, 2023</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added a workaround for Storj's S3 incompatibility (returning a 429 HTTP status code instead of 503 as S3 does).</li>
    <li>Removed the "thinning" function from backup plans. Too many people found backup records were permanently deleted that they weren't expecting to be deleted, and that's a really bad user experience, so we felt it was best to remove the function. As an alternative to limit the amount of storage used by your backup plan, edit the plan, click the Retention tab, check 'Limit storage used' and enter a value. </li>
    <li>Changed "Delete..." button label to "Delete Backup Record..." to make it clearer what the button does; also added a confirmation dialog with a reminder that the action is permanent and cannot be undone.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Added support for backing up to any folder in Google Drive instead of only 'Arq Backup Data'.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause Arq to start, stop, then start the backup plan unnecessarily on the next run after modifications to the backup plan.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause Arq Agent to crash on startup when encountering unexpected configuration files.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.21.2.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">May 8, 2023</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause a "missing backupfolders.json" error if an Arq5-created backup set was adopted, edited, and then a new backup was run.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue which caused a crash in restore-only mode.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.21.0.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">April 26, 2023</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added Import and Export buttons for a backup plan's file selections.</li>
    <li>Added support for new AWS regions.</li>
    <li>Added "Use Dual-Stack AWS Endpoint" checkbox for AWS storage locations.</li>
    <li>When restoring a folder containing "deleted" items (because "keep deleted files in subsequent backup records" option was checked in the backup plan, don't restore those "deleted" items. "Deleted" items can still be individually restored.</li>
    <li>When adding a B2 storage location and user chooses an existing bucket, show an error if bucket's lifecycle policy isn't 'keep only last version'.</li>
    <li>When loading backup sets, if a backup set is missing items, show it anyway (with an error message) so that the user can select it and delete it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue which prevented single-file backups created by Arq 5 from being restored correctly.</li>
    <li>Retry on AWS 503 errors.</li>

</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.18.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">January 11, 2023</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added safeguards to prevent deletion of the wrong backup records when applying retention rules.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause icons in the tree view to look garbled on Windows 11.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.16.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">October 28, 2022</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause "authentication failure" errors when setting app password.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.15.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">October 20, 2022</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause "HMACSHA256 of encryption dat file does not match" errors when attempting to browse backup records created by Arq 5 in a backup set that's also being used by Arq 7.</li>
</ul>



<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.14.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">October 17, 2022</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added a workaround to support S3-compatible storage locations (e2, Minio) with object lock which return non-standard error codes when attempting to delete a locked object, causing Arq to report an error for an action which isn't actually an error.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.12.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">September 6, 2022</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Updated Google OAuth authorization process to comply with Google's policy change deprecating the OAuth "out-of-band" flow.</li>
    <li>Store the key derived from the "app password" instead of the actual app password. This protects against malware running as root potentially stealing the app password, which a user might reuse elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Return a better error message from B2 when a file is not found instead of B2's generic "file with such name does not exist" message.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.10.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">September 6, 2022</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues></h2>
<ul>
    <li>When backing up to an SFTP server, retry up to 5 times rather than retrying for up to 60 seconds, to ensure that Arq retries in the case of a timeout.</li>
    <li>Instead of storing the backup plan encryption password (accessible only by root), store the encryption key derived from it (accessible only by root). This protects against malware running as root potentially stealing the encryption password, which a user might reuse elsewhere, thus potentially giving an attacker access to data beyond that legitimately needed for Arq's normal operation. This addresses CVE-2022-36617 filed by Sam Haskins.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.5.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">June 13, 2022</p>

</ul>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>

<p class="dateline">March 29, 2022</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue where auto-update would download and install an update that wasn't included with your license's updates. Arq 7.18 will accept all Arq 7 licenses regardless of updates-end-date in order to work around this issue for people who experienced it.

<p class="dateline">March 22, 2022</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Accept all Arq 7 licenses regardless of updates-end-date in order to avoid issues with people who had an Arq version older than 7.13 and subsequently turned on auto-update and received a version newer than their license's updates-end-date. All versions of Arq prior to 7.15.1 will update to 7.15.1. Arq 7.15.1 and future versions will update to the latest version available unless it's newer than the license's updates-end-date.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.15.0.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">March 14, 2022</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>

    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause 'access denied' errors when connecting to an SMB network volume without using a username or password.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause a crash of Arq.exe when encountering unexpected data browsing backup plans.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.14.1.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">January 28, 2022</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Truncate activity log text in email reports to avoid unreasonably large emails.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.13.4.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">January 28, 2022</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a license activation issue for some customers.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause 'missing date in license data' error for lifetime license customers.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.13.3.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">January 25, 2022</p>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could cause a crash with "read-only mode".</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.13.2.0</h1>

</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.12.0.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">December 17, 2021</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Changed Arq's behavior regarding unknown objects found when adopting backup sets (or upgrading from Arq 5). On first backup after adopting a backup set, Arq will initialize its database from existing data as much as possible; it will reuse objects as much as it can and leav the remaining objects alone. The "Remove Unreferenced Data" function will delete all unreferenced data, including objects found during initialization that weren't referenced by any backup record that Arq was successfully able to read during initialization. This resolves the scenario where, with Arq 5, the user may have deleted backup records but not executed Arq 5's "Remove Unreferenced Data" function.</li>
    <li>Retry on HTTP 408 errors.</li>
    <li>Changed the retention behavior: When applying retention rules after backup, Arq now writes to the activity log every backup record date/time and whether it was kept or deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when clicking "Create Backup Plan" with no storage locations configured (which causes the add-storage-location dialog to appear) and then clicking Cancel on the add-storage-location dialog.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where Arq could crash if the Restore button is clicked before a storage location has been selected.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue that could cause a null-reference exception when browsing S3 data in a versioned bucket where versioning has been turned off and later turned on, resulting in some objects with 'null' as the version ID.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where script arguments weren't being passed correctly when executing postflight scripts.</li>
    <li>Fixed tab navigation issues in the edit-backup-plan window.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Fixed issues with applying retention settings.</li>
    <li>Check for .NET version 4.7.2 or later, and write to event log if it's not available.</li>

    <li>Removed a workaround that was causing Arq to retry on erroneous Amazon Drive 400 errors (which Amazon Drive seems to have stopped sending).</li>
</ul>


<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.9.6.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">November 5, 2021</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added a workaround for Amazon Drive's inconsistency in showing accurate directory contents for just-created directories.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.9.1.0</h1>
<p class="dateline">November 5, 2021</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for Wasabi ap-northeast-2 region.</li>
    <li>Prompt for a storage class when creating an all-drives or all-user-data backup plan on AWS, instead of defaulting to Standard.</li>
    <li>Suppoort adopting a backup set that was copied from a non-object-lock bucket to an object-lock bucket by resetting the backup set's bucket-versioning-is-on flag.</li>
    <li>During restore, if Arq encounters data that Arq expects as readable but the user has modified to be Glacier or Deep Archive, request that objects be made downloadable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixed Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added a workaround for unexpected error responses from Microsoft Graph API (OneDrive/SharePoint).</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where network-transfer-rate limit wasn't being used when backing up to SFTP.</li>
