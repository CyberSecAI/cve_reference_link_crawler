# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.31.0.0

Aug 15, 2024

## Changes

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.30.3.0

Aug 1, 2024

## Changes

* If you add a mount-point type reparse point as a folder to be backed up in your backup plan, Arq will traverse the reparse point and back up the contents of that volume. Reparse points within it are still backed up as reparse points (not traversed). This was added to enable backing up of volumes mounted in NTFS without a drive letter.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.30.2.0

July 29, 2024

May 3, 2024

## Fixed Issues

* Fixed an issue where a file that was "Deleted/Kept" (because the backup plan's settings included keeping deleted files in subseequent backup records) which subsequently reappeared was still shown as "Deleted/Kept".

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.27.7.0

March 29, 2024

## Fixed Issues

* Fixed an issue where Arq would show a Google error 'unauthorized\_client' instead of prompting to grant access.
* When launched, Arq attempts to check whether OAuth tokens are valid, and prompts to grant access for any token that isn't valid.
* Arq checks whether the authorized Google Cloud Storage OAuth token actually has access to the data, not just that it's a valid token, and prompts to grant access if not.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.27.3.0

March 27, 2024

## Fixed Issues

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.24.2.0

September 25, 2023

## Changes

* Added a workaround for Storj's S3 incompatibility (returning a 429 HTTP status code instead of 503 as S3 does).
* Removed the "thinning" function from backup plans. Too many people found backup records were permanently deleted that they weren't expecting to be deleted, and that's a really bad user experience, so we felt it was best to remove the function. As an alternative to limit the amount of storage used by your backup plan, edit the plan, click the Retention tab, check 'Limit storage used' and enter a value.
* Changed "Delete..." button label to "Delete Backup Record..." to make it clearer what the button does; also added a confirmation dialog with a reminder that the action is permanent and cannot be undone.

* Fixed an issue which caused a crash in restore-only mode.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.21.0.0

April 26, 2023

## Improvements

* Added Import and Export buttons for a backup plan's file selections.
* Added support for new AWS regions.
* Added "Use Dual-Stack AWS Endpoint" checkbox for AWS storage locations.
* When restoring a folder containing "deleted" items (because "keep deleted files in subsequent backup records" option was checked in the backup plan, don't restore those "deleted" items. "Deleted" items can still be individually restored.
* When adding a B2 storage location and user chooses an existing bucket, show an error if bucket's lifecycle policy isn't 'keep only last version'.
* When loading backup sets, if a backup set is missing items, show it anyway (with an error message) so that the user can select it and delete it.

## Fixed Issues

* Fixed an issue which prevented single-file backups created by Arq 5 from being restored correctly.
* Retry on AWS 503 errors.
* Changed 'thinning' algorithm to use GMT time zone to avoid potential issues when switching to/from daylight savings time.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.18.0

January 11, 2023

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.14.0

October 17, 2022

## Updates

* Added a workaround to support S3-compatible storage locations (e2, Minio) with object lock which return non-standard error codes when attempting to delete a locked object, causing Arq to report an error for an action which isn't actually an error.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.12.0

September 6, 2022

## Updates

* Updated Google OAuth authorization process to comply with Google's policy change deprecating the OAuth "out-of-band" flow.
* Store the key derived from the "app password" instead of the actual app password. This protects against malware running as root potentially stealing the app password, which a user might reuse elsewhere.
* Return a better error message from B2 when a file is not found instead of B2's generic "file with such name does not exist" message.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.19.10.0

September 6, 2022

## Fixed Issues>

* When backing up to an SFTP server, retry up to 5 times rather than retrying for up to 60 seconds, to ensure that Arq retries in the case of a timeout.
* Instead of storing the backup plan encryption password (accessible only by root), store the encryption key derived from it (accessible only by root). This protects against malware running as root potentially stealing the encryption password, which a user might reuse elsewhere, thus potentially giving an attacker access to data beyond that legitimately needed for Arq's normal operation. This addresses CVE-2022-36617 filed by Sam Haskins.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.18.0.0

March 29, 2022

## Fixed Issues

* Fixed an issue where auto-update would download and install an update that wasn't included with your license's updates. Arq 7.18 will accept all Arq 7 licenses regardless of updates-end-date in order to work around this issue for people who experienced it.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.12.0.0

December 17, 2021

## Changes

* Changed Arq's behavior regarding unknown objects found when adopting backup sets (or upgrading from Arq 5). On first backup after adopting a backup set, Arq will initialize its database from existing data as much as possible; it will reuse objects as much as it can and leav the remaining objects alone. The "Remove Unreferenced Data" function will delete all unreferenced data, including objects found during initialization that weren't referenced by any backup record that Arq was successfully able to read during initialization. This resolves the scenario where, with Arq 5, the user may have deleted backup records but not executed Arq 5's "Remove Unreferenced Data" function.
* Retry on HTTP 408 errors.
* Changed the retention behavior: When applying retention rules after backup, Arq now writes to the activity log every backup record date/time and whether it was kept or deleted.

## Fixed Issues

* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when clicking "Create Backup Plan" with no storage locations configured (which causes the add-storage-location dialog to appear) and then clicking Cancel on the add-storage-location dialog.
* Fixed an issue where Arq could crash if the Restore button is clicked before a storage location has been selected.
* Fixed an issue that could cause a null-reference exception when browsing S3 data in a versioned bucket where versioning has been turned off and later turned on, resulting in some objects with 'null' as the version ID.
* Fixed an issue where script arguments weren't being passed correctly when executing postflight scripts.
* Fixed tab navigation issues in the edit-backup-plan window.

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.11.0.0

November 30, 2021

November 16, 2021

## Improvements

* Added support for Wasabi eu-west-1 (London) region.

## Fixed Issues

* Fixed issues with applying retention settings.
* Check for .NET version 4.7.2 or later, and write to event log if it's not available.
* Fixed an issue where no-backups-after-n-days alerts weren't being shown.
* Removed a workaround that was causing Arq to retry on erroneous Amazon Drive 400 errors (which Amazon Drive seems to have stopped sending).

# Release Notes for Arq Backup Version 7.9.6.0

## Fixed Issues

* Added a workaround for unexpected error responses from Microsoft Graph API (OneDrive/SharePoint).
* Fixed an issue where network-transfer-rate limit wasn't being used when backing up to SFTP.
* Fixed an issue where deleted/kept files weren't properly being marked as deleted/kept when the "keep deleted files in subsequent backup records" option was enabled in the backup plan.
* Fixed an issue that could cause errors when encountering objects in an S3 bucket with "null" version IDs, e.g. when versioning is enabled, disabled, then enabled again on a bucket.

September 23, 2021

### Perfect backups

Arq uses Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service to create perfectly consistent backups of your files every time.

If you're modifying your files as they're being backed up, it won't affect the backups.

### More power

* Run multiple backup jobs in parallel
* Scans and uploads files in parallel for faster throughput
* Only scans changed files/directories after the initial backup (uses filesystem events to detect changes on macOS and Windows)

* You can limit the scheduled backups to certain days of the week
* You can limit transfer rate to certain times of the day at certain days of the week
* Powerful new rules for selecting which files and folders are included and excluded from backup
* Time-based retention rules in addition to budget-based rules
* Optionally keep deleted files in subsequent backups for easy locating of deleted files
* Get alerts when no backups have occurred for days

### More secure

* Set a password on Arq 7 to prevent others from opening Arq and deleting backups.
* Uses SHA256 for checksums instead of SHA1.

### More storage savings

* Arq 7 can back up to AWS Glacier Deep Archive. Store your backups there for $0.99/TB per month.
* Arq 7 can back up to Google Cloud Archive. Store your backups there for $1.230/TB per month with instant access to backups..

### New Arq Premium subscription option

All the features of Arq 7 plus:

* 1 TB storage included
* Up to 5 computers
* Simpler configuration
* Secure web access to your backups
* $5.99/month (extra storage billed at $.00599/GB per month)

### Even more features

* All-new, modern user interface
* Disk device tracking instead of path-based — multiple external drives with the same name are treated as separate
* Faster object cleanup
* Faster validation
* Faster search

* Progress bars showing percent complete
* Wake for backup
* More informative SMTP test results — full SMTP connection log when an error occurs

# CVE-2022-36617 Report

**From:** Sam Haskins

**To:** ██████████

**Product:** [Arq Backup](https://www.arqbackup.com/)

**Date:** July 15th, 2022

**Date of public disclosure:** September 7th, 2022

**Attachments:**

**09/07/2019 Author's Note:**

As of September 7th, 2022, CVE-2022-36617 has been patched with the release of Arq Backup 7.19.10.0 for Windows /
7.19.3 for macOS.

Hi Stefan,

First off, let me just say that I really like Arq Backup.
I've been using it on my laptop for over a year now, and it fills its niche perfectly.

The vulnerability I discovered is that backup encryption passwords are stored locally in a reversibly encrypted way, which would
allow malware running locally with administrative privileges to steal the user's password(s). I've included a proof of concept
demo script of this in the attached zip file (password is "█████████").

Thankfully, this is pretty easy to fix. As Arq already derives the backup encryption key from the user's password with a slow
key derivation function, it does not have to store the user's password—only the derived encryption key.

Note that is is not a problem to store other types of secrets (e.g. OAuth refresh tokens, etc.) in a reversibly encrypted way as
they are not reused. In contrast, users will reuse passwords elsewhere, so compromise by an attacker grants access beyond that
legitimately needed for Arq's normal operation.

I will be following the industry standard of responsible disclosure with this vulnerability, as elucidated in
[Google's policy](https://about.google/appsecurity/).
Your deadline is (July 14 + 90 days = ) October 12th, 2022.

Please notify me when you have successfully reproduced the vulnerability using my proof of concept, or if you have trouble doing
so. Additionally, feel free to email me about any other matter in connection with my report; I'm here to help.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,

Sam Haskins
