Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Arq Backup was storing the backup encryption password. Instead of storing only the encryption key derived from the user's password, it was storing the actual password itself in a reversibly encrypted format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data:** The primary weakness is the storage of the user's backup encryption password in a reversibly encrypted form, making it susceptible to theft.
*   **Reversible Encryption:**  The use of reversible encryption for sensitive passwords is a vulnerability, as it allows for relatively easy decryption compared to irreversible hashing techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker with administrative privileges on a compromised system could steal the stored encryption password, allowing them to decrypt and access the user's backed-up data.
*   **Wider Access:** Since users often reuse passwords, a compromised backup encryption password could grant an attacker access to other systems and services beyond the scope of the Arq Backup application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malware:** The primary attack vector is malware running locally with administrative privileges on the victim's machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker must have administrative privileges (e.g., root) on the target system to access the reversibly encrypted password.
*   **Local Access:** The attack is based on local system access; it is not a remote attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor, Arq Backup, has addressed this vulnerability by storing only the derived encryption key instead of the password itself.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Sam Haskins and responsibly disclosed to the vendor.
*   The patch for the vulnerability was released in Arq Backup version 7.19.10.0 for Windows and 7.19.3 for macOS.
*   The report also highlights that storing other secrets, like OAuth refresh tokens, in a reversibly encrypted way is not problematic due to their non-reused nature.
