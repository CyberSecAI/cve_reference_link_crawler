- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GitLab instance version is being passed to the client-side code without proper authorization checks, making it visible in the page source even to anonymous users.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure. The GitLab version number is exposed in the HTML source code of any page, including pages accessible to unauthenticated users.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious actors can easily identify the specific GitLab version being used, making it easier to target known vulnerabilities affecting that particular version. This increases the risk of successful attacks.

- **Attack vectors:** By simply viewing the source code of any GitLab page. This can be done by anyone who can access the GitLab instance through a browser (unauthenticated).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires no authentication and has to visit the GitLab instance web page through a browser.
