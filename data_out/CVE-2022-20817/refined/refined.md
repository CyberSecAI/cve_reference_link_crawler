- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper key generation during the manufacturing process resulting in duplicated manufactured keys installed on multiple devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Duplicated cryptographic keys on multiple Cisco IP Phones. This falls under CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could impersonate another user's phone by performing a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the secure communication between the phone and the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM).
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, MITM attack on secure communication between a vulnerable IP Phone and the CUCM server when the CUCM is in secure mode (mixed mode).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MITM attack on the network traffic between the IP Phone and the CUCM. The attacker must also target a network using CUCM in secure mode.
