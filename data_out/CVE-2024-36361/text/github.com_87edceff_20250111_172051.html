### @molangning **[molangning](/molangning)** commented [Feb 26, 2024](#issue-2154065288) • edited Loading

If templateName gets injected attackers can inject arbitrary code.

Example payload: `templateName="a(){}; function template (locals) {var pug_html = process.mainModule.require('fs').readFileSync('/etc/passwd').toString(), pug_mixins = {}, pug_interp;var pug_debug_filename, pug_debug_line;try {;//"`

Checks are added to restrict template names to `0-9, a-z, A-Z, -, _`

Special conditions are needed for this to happen and proper circumstances are needed for this vulnerability to be triggered.

Additionally, if node.line get affected due to prototype pollution code is also injectable

Example payload: `Object.prototype.block = {"type": "Text", "line": "console.log(process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id').toString())"};`

Reference: <https://po6ix.github.io/AST-Injection/>

A check is added to to ensure the line number is really a line.

[#3414](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/3414) is also worth a follow up, and maps could be used for options to prevent prototype pollution but changing all of those may break some things so I did not touch those.

Sorry, something went wrong.

It would, but that meant that it’s checking for all three instead of checking for the required two and failing silently. Throwing an error is better as it can alert the user that there may be a pollution.

### **[samuzora](/samuzora)** commented [May 14, 2024](#issuecomment-2109470995)

| Hi! I'm the original discoverer of this bug - I wrote a CTF challenge to demonstrate a PoC of this in late Feb 2024 [here](https://github.com/Coding-Competition-Team/hackac-2024/tree/main/web/pug). [@molangning](https://github.com/molangning) was a participant in the CTF, and I gave him permission afterwards to open a PR to introduce the necessary checks to mitigate the issue.  In the original challenge, the vulnerability was introduced by exposing the `compileBody` internal function which does no checks/restrictions on the `templateName` option. This, together with passing of the query object to `options`, allows for server-side RCE. However, I did not consider this a bug that was worth reporting because:   1. It requires the exposure of internal functions that aren't exported in the regular Pug module 2. Passing in of the `options` object is generally considered wrong usage of JS templating engines (eg. ejs's homepage <https://ejs.co/>)   However, since then, I did a re-audit of the Pug source, and realized that the exported functions `compileClient`, `compileClientWithDependenciesTracked` and `compileFileClient` are all vulnerable to this bug. The main line of contention is in [here](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/blob/4767cafea0af3d3f935553df0f9a8a6e76d470c2/packages/pug/lib/index.js#L328), where `options.name` is passed into `templateName` with no checks.  Minimal working example:  ``` const express = require("express") const pug = require("pug") const runtimeWrap = require('pug-runtime/wrap');  const PORT = 3000  const app = express()  app.get("/", (req, res) => {   const out = runtimeWrap(pug.compileClient('string of pug', req.query))   res.send(out()) })  app.listen(PORT, () => {   console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`) }) ```  The minimal working payload for server-side RCE is `template() { var x = global.process.mainModule.require; return x("child_process").execSync('ls').toString(); }; function asdf`. Passing this to the `name` query parameter will result in RCE.  Still, this is contentious usage of the `compileClient` family of functions - these are usually used for compiling the rendering function server-side, then sending it to the client to be rendered client-side. The passing of arbitrary options to `compileClient` is also still required. Nevertheless, arbitrary JavaScript execution is still possible client-side, leading to possible XSS and CSRF.  The urgency of this issue is a lot higher now since it doesn't require the intentional exposure of internal functions. Just a small suggestion regarding the regex check - it should be `/^[0-9a-zA-Z\_]+?$/` without the `-`, to prevent unintentional SyntaxError from the dash. Other than that, the PR should be merged as soon as possible.  I apologize if this was a breach of the security report guidelines for Pug. I was not aware that the bug could be exploited in legitimate applications of the module, and hence allowed [@molangning](https://github.com/molangning) to publish a PR directly. |
