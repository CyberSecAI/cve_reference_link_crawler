### @molangning **[molangning](/molangning)** commented [Feb 26, 2024](#issue-2154065288) • edited Loading

If templateName gets injected attackers can inject arbitrary code.

Example payload: `templateName="a(){}; function template (locals) {var pug_html = process.mainModule.require('fs').readFileSync('/etc/passwd').toString(), pug_mixins = {}, pug_interp;var pug_debug_filename, pug_debug_line;try {;//"`

Checks are added to restrict template names to `0-9, a-z, A-Z, -, _`

Special conditions are needed for this to happen and proper circumstances are needed for this vulnerability to be triggered.

Additionally, if node.line get affected due to prototype pollution code is also injectable

Example payload: `Object.prototype.block = {"type": "Text", "line": "console.log(process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id').toString())"};`

Reference: <https://po6ix.github.io/AST-Injection/>

A check is added to to ensure the line number is really a line.

[#3414](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/3414) is also worth a follow up, and maps could be used for options to prevent prototype pollution but changing all of those may break some things so I did not touch those.

Sorry, something went wrong.

It would, but that meant that it’s checking for all three instead of checking for the required two and failing silently. Throwing an error is better as it can alert the user that there may be a pollution.

### **[samuzora](/samuzora)** commented [May 14, 2024](#issuecomment-2109470995)

| Hi! I'm the original discoverer of this bug - I wrote a CTF challenge to demonstrate a PoC of this in late Feb 2024 [here](https://github.com/Coding-Competition-Team/hackac-2024/tree/main/web/pug). [@molangning](https://github.com/molangning) was a participant in the CTF, and I gave him permission afterwards to open a PR to introduce the necessary checks to mitigate the issue.  In the original challenge, the vulnerability was introduced by exposing the `compileBody` internal function which does no checks/restrictions on the `templateName` option. This, together with passing of the query object to `options`, allows for server-side RCE. However, I did not consider this a bug that was worth reporting because:   1. It requires the exposure of internal functions that aren't exported in the regular Pug module 2. Passing in of the `options` object is generally considered wrong usage of JS templating engines (eg. ejs's homepage <https://ejs.co/>)   However, since then, I did a re-audit of the Pug source, and realized that the exported functions `compileClient`, `compileClientWithDependenciesTracked` and `compileFileClient` are all vulnerable to this bug. The main line of contention is in [here](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/blob/4767cafea0af3d3f935553df0f9a8a6e76d470c2/packages/pug/lib/index.js#L328), where `options.name` is passed into `templateName` with no checks.  Minimal working example:  ``` const express = require("express") const pug = require("pug") const runtimeWrap = require('pug-runtime/wrap');  const PORT = 3000  const app = express()  app.get("/", (req, res) => {   const out = runtimeWrap(pug.compileClient('string of pug', req.query))   res.send(out()) })  app.listen(PORT, () => {   console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`) }) ```  The minimal working payload for server-side RCE is `template() { var x = global.process.mainModule.require; return x("child_process").execSync('ls').toString(); }; function asdf`. Passing this to the `name` query parameter will result in RCE.  Still, this is contentious usage of the `compileClient` family of functions - these are usually used for compiling the rendering function server-side, then sending it to the client to be rendered client-side. The passing of arbitrary options to `compileClient` is also still required. Nevertheless, arbitrary JavaScript execution is still possible client-side, leading to possible XSS and CSRF.  The urgency of this issue is a lot higher now since it doesn't require the intentional exposure of internal functions. Just a small suggestion regarding the regex check - it should be `/^[0-9a-zA-Z\_]+?$/` without the `-`, to prevent unintentional SyntaxError from the dash. Other than that, the PR should be merged as soon as possible.  I apologize if this was a breach of the security report guidelines for Pug. I was not aware that the bug could be exploited in legitimate applications of the module, and hence allowed [@molangning](https://github.com/molangning) to publish a PR directly. |

# API Reference

This page details how to render Pug using the JavaScript API.

###### Tip

**Pug is available in your Web browserâs console!** To test drive Pugâs API, as documented on this page, try entering:

```
pug.render('p Hello world!');

```
## Options [Â¶](#options)

All API methods accept the following set of options:

filename: stringThe name of the file being compiled. Used in exceptions, and required for relative `include`\s and `extend`\s. Defaults to `'Pug'`.basedir: stringThe root directory of all absolute inclusion.doctype: stringIf the `doctype` is not specified as part of the template, you can specify it here. It is sometimes useful to get self-closing tags and remove mirroring of boolean attributes. See [doctype documentation](../language/doctype.html#doctype-option) for more information.pretty: boolean | string[Deprecated.] Adds whitespace to the resulting HTML to make it easier for a human to read using `'Â Â '` as indentation. If a string is specified, that will be used as indentation instead (e.g. `'\t'`). We strongly recommend against using this option. Too often, it creates subtle bugs in your templates because of the way it alters the interpretation and rendering of whitespace, and so this feature is going to be removed. Defaults to `false`.filters: objectHash table of [custom filters](../language/filters.html#custom-filters). Defaults to `undefined`.self: booleanUse a `self` namespace to hold the locals. It will speed up the compilation, but instead of writing `variable` you will have to write `self.variable` to access a property of the locals object. Defaults to `false`.debug: booleanIf set to `true`, the tokens and function body are logged to stdout.compileDebug: booleanIf set to `true`, the function source will be included in the compiled template for better error messages (sometimes useful in development). It is enabled by default, unless used with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) in production mode.globals: Array<string>Add a list of global names to make accessible in templates.cache: booleanIf set to `true`, compiled functions are cached. `filename` must be set as the cache key. Only applies to `render` functions. Defaults to `false`.inlineRuntimeFunctions: booleanInline runtime functions instead of `require`-ing them from a shared version. For `compileClient` functions, the default is `true` (so that one does not have to include the runtime). For all other compilation or rendering types, the default is `false`.name: stringThe name of the template function. Only applies to `compileClient` functions. Defaults to `'template'`.
## Methods [Â¶](#methods)

### pug.compile(source, ?options) [Â¶](#pugcompilesource-options)

Compile a Pug template to a function, which can be rendered multiple times with different locals.

source: stringThe source Pug template to compileoptions: ?optionsAn options object
returns: functionA function to generate the HTML from an object containing locals
```
var pug = require('pug');

// Compile a function
var fn = pug.compile('string of pug', options);

// Render the function
var html = fn(locals);
// => '<string>of pug</string>'

```
### pug.compileFile(path, ?options) [Â¶](#pugcompilefilepath-options)

Compile a Pug template from a file to a function, which can be rendered multiple times with different locals.

path: stringThe path to a Pug fileoptions: ?optionsAn options object
returns: functionA function to generate the HTML from an object containing locals
```
var pug = require('pug');

// Compile a function
var fn = pug.compileFile('path to pug file', options);

// Render the function
var html = fn(locals);
// => '<string>of pug</string>'

```
### pug.compileClient(source, ?options) [Â¶](#pugcompileclientsource-options)

Compile a Pug template to a string of JavaScript, which can be used client side.

source: stringThe Pug template to compileoptions: ?optionsAn options object
returns: stringA string of JavaScript representing a function
```
var pug = require('pug');

// Compile a function
var fn = pug.compileClient('string of pug', options);

// Render the function
var html = fn(locals);
// => 'function template(locals) { return "<string>of pug</string>"; }'

```
### pug.compileClientWithDependenciesTracked(source, ?options) [Â¶](#pugcompileclientwithdependenciestrackedsource-options)

Same as `[compileClient](#pugcompilesource-options)`, except that this method returns an object of the form:

```
{
  'body': 'function (locals) {...}',
  'dependencies': ['filename.pug']
}

```

You should only use this method if you need `dependencies` to implement something like watching for changes to the Pug files.

### pug.compileFileClient(path, ?options) [Â¶](#pugcompilefileclientpath-options)

Compile a Pug template file to a string of JavaScript that can be used client side.

path: stringThe path to a Pug fileoptions: ?optionsAn options objectoptions.name: stringIf you pass a `.name` property on the options object, it will be used as the name of your client side template function.
returns: stringA JavaScript function body.

First, our template file.

```
h1 This is a Pug template
h2 By #{author}

```

Then, we compile the Pug file into a function string.

```
var fs = require('fs');
var pug = require('pug');

// Compile the template to a function string
var jsFunctionString = pug.compileFileClient('/path/to/pugFile.pug', {name: "fancyTemplateFun"});

// Maybe you want to compile all of your templates to a templates.js file and serve it to the client
fs.writeFileSync("templates.js", jsFunctionString);

```

Hereâs what the output function string looks like (written to `templates.js`).

```
function fancyTemplateFun(locals) {
  var buf = [];
  var pug_mixins = {};
  var pug_interp;

  var locals_for_with = (locals || {});

  (function (author) {
    buf.push("<h1>This is a Pug template</h1><h2>By "
      + (pug.escape((pug_interp = author) == null ? '' : pug_interp))
      + "</h2>");
  }.call(this, "author" in locals_for_with ?
    locals_for_with.author : typeof author !== "undefined" ?
      author : undefined)
  );

  return buf.join("");
}

```
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="/templates.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is one fancy template.</h1>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      var html = window.fancyTemplateFun({author: "enlore"});
      var div = document.createElement("div");
      div.innerHTML = html;
      document.body.appendChild(div);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```
### pug.render(source, ?options, ?callback) [Â¶](#pugrendersource-options-callback)

source: stringThe source Pug template to renderoptions: ?optionsAn options object, also used as the locals objectcallback: ?functionNode.js-style callback receiving the rendered results. **This callback is called synchronously.**
returns: stringThe resulting HTML string
```
var pug = require('pug');

var html = pug.render('string of pug', options);
// => '<string>of pug</string>'

```
### pug.renderFile(path, ?options, ?callback) [Â¶](#pugrenderfilepath-options-callback)

path: stringThe path to the Pug file to renderoptions: ?optionsAn options object, also used as the locals objectcallback: ?functionNode.js-style callback receiving the rendered results. **This callback is called synchronously.**
returns: stringThe resulting HTML string
```
var pug = require('pug');

var html = pug.renderFile('path/to/file.pug', options);
// ...

```
## Properties [Â¶](#properties)

### pug.filters [Â¶](#pugfilters)

A hash table of [custom filters](../language/filters.html#custom-filters).

This object has the same semantics as the [`filters` option](#options), but applies globally to all Pug compilation. When a filter is present in both `pug.filters` and `options.filters`, the `filters` option takes precedence.

###### Deprecated

This property has been deprecated in favor of the [`filters` option](#options).
