- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings. Specifically, the "Custom CSS" field within the styling options does not properly sanitize user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin is vulnerable to persistent XSS due to the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin-level privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views a product page. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website, even when `unfiltered_html` is disabled.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with administrative privileges can inject a malicious script into the Custom CSS field within the plugin's settings page. When a user views a product page, the malicious script executes in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative access to the WordPress site. They must be able to access the plugin's settings page in the WordPress admin dashboard.
