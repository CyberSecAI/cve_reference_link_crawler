## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Product Enquiry for WooCommerce < 3.1.8 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=product-enquiry-for-woocommerce
2. In the "Styling Options" section add the payload `</style><script>alert('XSS: Custom CSS')</script>` in the Custom CSS field.
3. View a product and see the XSS.

### Affects Plugins
