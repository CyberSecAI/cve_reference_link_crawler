- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `expand_mmac_params` function of the yasm assembler.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-use-after-free. The vulnerability occurs when a memory region is freed, and then subsequently accessed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the yasm assembler, potentially leading to denial of service. There is a possibility of arbitrary code execution if the vulnerability is further exploited.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input file to the yasm assembler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to the yasm assembler. This could be achieved if the attacker can control the input to yasm.
