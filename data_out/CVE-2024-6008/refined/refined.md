The provided content relates to CVE-2024-6008.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `edit_book.php` file of the itsourcecode Online-Bookstore-Project-In-PHP 1.0. Specifically, the filename obtained from the `$_FILES` variable is directly used to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without any security checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization on the uploaded filename.
- Direct use of user-provided filename to determine the storage location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can upload malicious files without restrictions, leading to:
  - File overwrite.
  - File injection.
  - Directory traversal attacks.
  - Denial of service attacks.
  - Remote code execution (RCE) by uploading and executing malicious scripts (e.g., PHP).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the file upload functionality within the `edit_book.php` file.
- Attackers can exploit this through a regular user login to pass malicious payloads via the file upload function.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user with the ability to edit books uploads a file with malicious content using the vulnerable form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires a valid user login (regular user privileges are sufficient).
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `edit_book.php` page, typically an admin or editor role would have this access.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious file upload request.
