  "baseScore": 5.2,
  "vector": "AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H",
  "summary": "Lack of stack protection exploit mechanisms in ASP Secure OS Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) may allow a privileged attacker with access to AMD signing keys to corrupt the return address, causing a stack-based buffer overrun, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
  "details": [
    {
      "vulnerability": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "rootCause": "Lack of stack protection mechanisms in the ASP Secure OS Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).",
      "impact": "A privileged attacker with access to AMD signing keys can corrupt the return address, causing a stack-based buffer overrun, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
       "attackVector": "Local access",

    "affectedProducts": [
        "1st Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors formerly codenamed \"Naples\"",
        "2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors formerly codenamed \"Rome\"",
        "3rd Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors formerly codenamed “Milan”",
        "4th Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors formerly codenamed “Genoa”"
        ],
  "mitigation": "No fix planned for Naples, Rome, Milan, and Genoa. It is mentioned that this is a defense in depth vulnerability and requires a more impactful event to be leveraged, specifically the loss of PSP signing keys."
