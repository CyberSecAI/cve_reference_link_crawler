The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48999.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A slab-out-of-bounds access in `fib_nh_match` when attempting to delete a multipath route while the `fib_info` structure contains a nexthop (nh) reference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is caused by a logic error in `fib_nh_match`. The function did not properly handle the case where a route was configured with a multipath specification (multiple next hops), but the corresponding `fib_info` entry was using a nexthop object which are mutually exclusive with legacy multipath spec. This mismatch led to an out-of-bounds access when the code tried to compare attributes of both multipath and nexthop objects simultaneously.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability leads to a slab-out-of-bounds read, which can cause a kernel crash. In some exploitation scenarios, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to delete a route using `ip route del` command, specifically when a multipath route exists alongside a nexthop object usage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to configure and delete IP routes. This can often be achieved by having CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities.
