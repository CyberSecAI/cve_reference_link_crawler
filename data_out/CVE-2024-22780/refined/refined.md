Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22780:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input provided through the `errmsg` parameter in the `/login` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application renders the user-controlled `errmsg` parameter directly into the HTML response without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code Execution: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- Information Disclosure: The attacker could potentially access sensitive information available within the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL.
- The attacker would need to lure a victim to click on a malicious link containing the XSS payload within the `errmsg` parameter (e.g., `address:port/login?errmsg=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker has to rely on social engineering techniques to trick the victim to click on the crafted link.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
