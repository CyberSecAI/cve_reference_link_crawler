Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-47106.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `nft_set_catchall_destroy` function. This occurs when iterating through a list of `nft_set_elem_catchall` structures and freeing them using `kfree_rcu`. After freeing a structure with `kfree_rcu`, it is no longer safe to access it, but the original code continued to do so, causing a use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in `nft_set_catchall_destroy`. The code was using `list_for_each_entry_rcu`, which doesn't provide a safe way to iterate and delete list entries, since `kfree_rcu` invalidates the pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel memory corruption due to use-after-free. This could lead to a crash or potentially to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when destroying an nf_tables set that has catch-all elements. The crash report indicates it was triggered via netlink messages, specifically related to `nf_tables_newsetelem`.
- The attack involves creating and then deleting a netfilter table set with catch-all elements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and manipulate netfilter tables, which typically requires the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.
