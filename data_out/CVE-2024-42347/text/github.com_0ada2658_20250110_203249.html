# URL preview setting for a room is controllable by the homeserver

High

[davidegirardi](/davidegirardi)
published
GHSA-f83w-wqhc-cfp4
Aug 6, 2024

## Package

matrix-react-sdk

## Affected versions

<3.105.1

## Patched versions

3.105.1

## Description

### Impact

A malicious homeserver could manipulate a user's account data to cause the client to enable URL previews in end-to-end encrypted rooms, in which case any URLs in encrypted messages would be sent to the server.

Even if the CVSS score would be 4.1 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)) we classify this as High severity issue.

### Patches

This was patched in matrix-react-sdk 3.105.1.

### Workarounds

Deployments that trust their homeservers, as well as closed federations of trusted servers, are not affected.

### References

N/A.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-42347

### Weaknesses

[CWE-359](/advisories?query=cwe%3A359)
