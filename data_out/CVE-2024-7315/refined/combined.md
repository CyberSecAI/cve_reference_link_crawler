## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid < 0.9.106 - Unauthenticated Sensitive Data Exposure

### Description

The plugin does not use sufficient randomness in the filename that is created when generating a backup, which could be bruteforced by attackers to leak sensitive information about said backups.

### Proof of Concept

1. Run a backup
2. Note that the backup zip file exists at the location `wp-content/wpvividbackups/original-stone-parakeet.jurassic.ninja\_wpvivid-[HEX\_TIMESTAMP]\_[YEAR]-[MONTH]-[DAY]-[HOUR]-[MINUTE]\_backup\_all.zip`
3. Note that the hex timestamp is a concatenation of the timestamp in seconds and a number of microseconds between 0 and 999,999. With a rough idea of when the backup was performed, an attacker could bruteforce the exact timestamp and recover the backup zip file.
