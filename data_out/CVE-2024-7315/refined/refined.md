- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient randomness in the filename generation for backup files. The filename uses a predictable timestamp format, which can be guessed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable filename generation leading to sensitive data exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive backup data by brute-forcing the filename of backup files.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, attacker needs to know when a backup was performed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need an approximate idea of when the backup was created. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
