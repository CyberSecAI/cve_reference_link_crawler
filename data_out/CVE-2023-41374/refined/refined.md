Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a double free error in the Kostac PLC Programming Software when parsing project files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-415 (Double Free):** Memory is freed twice while processing line number information in a specially crafted project file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution is possible if a user opens a specially crafted project file.
*   Information disclosure is also a potential impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L).
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious project file, saved using Kostac PLC Programming Software Version 1.6.9.0 or earlier.
*   The user must be tricked into opening the crafted file (User Interaction Required - UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted project file.
*   The attacker does not require special privileges or authentication on the target system (PR:N).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of KPP project files.
*   The issue occurs specifically in the processing of line number information.
*   The vendor has released an updated version of the software (1.6.12.0 and above) to address the vulnerability.
*   A workaround is available by re-saving older project files (saved with versions 1.6.9.0 or earlier) using version 1.6.10.0 or later, which implements a function preventing project file alteration.
