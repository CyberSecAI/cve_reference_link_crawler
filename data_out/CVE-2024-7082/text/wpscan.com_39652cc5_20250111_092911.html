## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# easy-table-of-contents < 2.0.68 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as Editor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Go to the widgets of the plugin and change "Title" field to "Malicious JS code eval() and etc. For example 123" onmouseover=alert(1)// -> Save Settings (Admins and editors are allowed to use JS in posts/pages/comments/etc, so the unfiltered\_html capability should be disallowed when testing for Stored XSS using such roles)
