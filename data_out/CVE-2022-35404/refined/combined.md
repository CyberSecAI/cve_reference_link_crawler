**Details:**

Unauthenticated creation of multiple arbitrary files and directories led to high resource consumption. This has been fixed now.

This issue has been fixed by introducing validation checks under our server side source code. These checks will validate the param with respective patterns before initiating a session.

**Impact:**

Due to huge number of file/ directory creation, there was a possibility of high resource consumption that might compromise the availability of network resources.

**Steps to upgrade:**

1. Download the latest upgrade pack from the following links for the respective products:
   * OpManager: <https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/service-packs.html>
   * Network Configuration Manager: <https://www.manageengine.com/network-configuration-manager/upgradepack.html>
   * NetFlow Analyzer: <https://www.manageengine.com/products/netflow/service-packs.html>
