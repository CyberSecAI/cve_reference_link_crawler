- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CX-Programmer software contains an out-of-bounds read, a use-after-free, and a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
    - Use-after-free (CWE-416)
    - Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: By having a user open a specially crafted CXP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious CXP file and have a user open it with the vulnerable software. User interaction is required.
