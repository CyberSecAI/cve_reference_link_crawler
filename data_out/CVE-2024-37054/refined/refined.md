Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-37054:

**CVE-2024-37054**

*   **Root Cause:** Deserialization vulnerability. The `_load_context_model_and_signature` function in `mlflow/pyfunc/model.py` uses `cloudpickle.load()` to deserialize a model file.
*   **Weakness:**  Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data. The use of `cloudpickle.load()` without proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject a malicious pickle object.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution. When a victim loads a model containing a malicious pickle object, the arbitrary code embedded within the pickle object is executed on their machine.
*  **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Attacker creates a malicious `PythonModel` using `mlflow.pyfunc.log_model()`.
    2.  The malicious payload is embedded using a crafted class definition and `__reduce__` method. This payload will be serialized using `cloudpickle` by the `log_model()` function.
    3.  The model is logged to the MLflow tracking server.
    4.  The victim loads the model using `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()`.
    5.  The `cloudpickle.load()` function deserializes the malicious object, triggering the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to log a model to the MLflow tracking server. No other capabilities are specified.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the function `_load_context_model_and_signature` within the file `mlflow/pyfunc/model.py`.
*   The vulnerable function is called by `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model`.
*   The injected malicious code is demonstrated using a crafted class `RunCommand` that executes a ping command using `os.system`.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in MLflow version 0.9.0.
*   The CVSS score is 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   The associated CWE is CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data).
