      "cve": "CVE-2024-4881",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` function in `lollms/security.py` was vulnerable to path traversal and allowed absolute paths despite intended protections.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insufficient validation and sanitization of file paths",
           "Incorrect regular expression for detecting suspicious patterns",
          "Failure to properly handle absolute paths in path sanitization",
          "Inconsistent error handling, sometimes returning a string error instead of raising an exception"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could potentially perform a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack by providing a crafted path, bypassing the intended security measures. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Manipulating file path input through an API endpoint or a web request"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a request to the server with the manipulated path. There is no mention of needing special privileges"
      },
       "additional_notes": "The commit includes changes to address these issues by adding absolute path checks as well as path sanitization to remove "..", and multiple forward slashes"
