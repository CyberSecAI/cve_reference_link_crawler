Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-36789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the password policy implementation of the Netgear WNR614 JNR1010V2/N300 router, specifically with firmware version V1.1.0.54_1.0.1. This allows users to create passwords that do not adhere to the intended security standards.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Password Policy Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the enforced password policy, allowing users to set weak passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Weak passwords significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access to the router's administrative interface.
- **Network Manipulation:** Once an attacker gains access, they can manipulate router settings, potentially compromising the entire network.
- **Data Exposure:** Compromised routers can lead to exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct User Interaction:** Users directly setting weak passwords through the router's interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Network Access:** The attacker would need to have access to the router's administrative interface.
- **Basic Router Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to access the router's settings and create/modify passwords.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content explicitly mentions that users can set single-digit passwords, which clearly violates password policy best practices.
- The provided POC image clearly demonstrates this weak password setting within the router's interface.
- The recommended mitigation for this issue, is to upgrade the firmware.
