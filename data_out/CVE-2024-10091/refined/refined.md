Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Image Comparison Widget" of the ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin. Specifically, user-supplied attributes are not properly handled, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This occurs because user-provided input, specifically the labels for the "before" and "after" images in the Image Comparison widget, are not sanitized or escaped before being rendered on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the affected widget. When a user views a page containing the injected widget, the attacker's script will execute within the user's browser.
- **Potential for Data Theft, Session Hijacking, Malicious Redirects:** This can lead to various malicious activities such as stealing cookies/session data, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Image Comparison Widget:** The attack vector is through the image comparison widget of the ElementsKit plugin.
- **User-Supplied Attributes:** Specifically, the 'Label' fields for the before and after images within this widget are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Contributor" level access or higher.
- **Access to Widget Settings:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the settings of the Image Comparison widget, specifically the label fields.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin up to and including 3.2.9.
