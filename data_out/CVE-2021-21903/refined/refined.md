- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `check_udp_crc` function of the Garrett iC Module CMA due to an unbounded `strcpy` operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcpy` to copy the CRC field into a fixed-size buffer (`input_crc_str`) without proper size validation. The software searches for the last semicolon (`;`) in the UDP packet and assumes the following data to be the CRC, copying this data into the buffer. If the provided CRC string is longer than 8 bytes, it overflows the buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, gaining control of the program counter, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The provided crash information shows that the program counter (`pc`) is overwritten with `0x4d4d4d4c` ("LMMM"), indicating control over the execution flow.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially-crafted UDP packet to the Garrett iC Module's discovery service on UDP port 6877. The crafted packet includes a CRC field that exceeds the allocated buffer size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device on the local network.
