Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided data when writing to PHP files, specifically within the `_format_php` function in Checkmk's `watolib`.
- The function attempts to escape single quotes in string data by prepending a backslash. However, it fails to account for existing backslashes preceding single quotes (`\'`), resulting in the sequence `\\'`. This allows escaping the string context in PHP and injection of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Code Injection:**  Authenticated users could inject arbitrary PHP code into files generated by Wato, specifically `auth.php`, by manipulating user data, such as profile settings. The injected code would be executed when the file was accessed by NagVis.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by accessing the NagVis component after the injection.
- **Complete System Compromise:** By gaining code execution, the attacker can take full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires an authenticated user, but automation user credentials (obtainable via another vulnerability) can be used.
- The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating user profile settings, which then causes the `auth.php` file to be updated with malicious code.
- After the malicious code is written to the file, accessing the NagVis component triggers the injected code, resulting in code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a Checkmk user. This can either be normal user credentials, or by leveraging an arbitrary file read vulnerability in NagVis (CVE-2022-46945) to obtain an automation user secret and then deleting a file to bypass the automation user check, ultimately gaining GUI login access with the automation user.
- **GUI Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Checkmk GUI (either via a normal user or after gaining access via the steps described above).
- **User Profile Modification:** The attacker must have the ability to modify their user profile within the Checkmk GUI to inject the malicious code.
- **Access to NagVis:** The attacker has to trigger the execution of injected code by accessing the NagVis component.

**Additional Information:**

- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 9.1 (Critical), with the vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L`
- **Affected Files:** The malicious code is injected in either of the files `var/check_mk/wato/auth/auth.php` or `var/check_mk/wato/php-api/hosttags.php`.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is mitigated by properly escaping both single-quote characters and backslash characters when formatting data for the PHP file, and disabling PHP on the server would be an immediate mitigation if NagVis is not required.
- **Patch:** This vulnerability is fixed in Checkmk version 2.1.0p11 and later.
