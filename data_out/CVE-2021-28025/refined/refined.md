The provided content is related to CVE-2021-28025.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow due to an invalid sign extension in the `QRadialFetchSimd<QSimdSse2>::fetch` function, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read
- Integer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault (SEGV)
- Program crash
- Potential for further exploitation if the read access reveals sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted SVG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to supply a crafted SVG file to an application that uses the vulnerable Qt library for SVG rendering (e.g., through a file upload or by loading a malicious website).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `QRadialFetchSimd<QSimdSse2>::fetch` function during the processing of radial gradients in SVG files.
- The issue is triggered by a crafted SVG file that causes an invalid sign extension, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory access during the `and ecx,DWORD PTR [rdx+rsi*4]` operation.
- The issue has been addressed in Qt versions 5.12.11, 5.15.4, 6.0.3, 6.1.0 RC, and 6.2.0.
- The fix involves clamping parsed doubles to float representable values.
- The crash occurs in `qdrawhelper_p.h` at line 601.
- The issue was discovered by 1vanChen of NSFOCUS Security Team.
