The provided content describes a security update for AcyMailing, a Joomla extension. It details multiple vulnerabilities that were addressed in version 8.7.0.

**Root cause of vulnerabilities:**
The root causes are not explicitly stated but are related to insecure handling of front-end features in the AcyMailing Enterprise edition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:** Allowed unauthorized access to campaigns.
2.  **Unauthorized List Creation:** Allowed unauthorized users to create new mailing lists.
3.  **Attachment Removal from Campaigns:** Allowed unauthorized removal of attachments from campaigns.
4.  **Subscriber List Enumeration:** Allowed unauthorized parties to obtain the number of subscribers in a specific list.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   XSS could lead to unauthorized access to campaigns.
*   Unauthorized list creation could lead to unauthorized access or modifications to email lists.
*   Attachment removal could impact the integrity of email campaigns.
*   Subscriber list enumeration could lead to unauthorized access to subscriber information.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities are located in the front-end campaign management interface of AcyMailing Enterprise. This means an attacker would need to interact with this front-end interface to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have access to a Joomla website where:
*   AcyMailing Enterprise is installed.
*   A front-end campaigns management menu has been created.
*   The AcyMailing version is between 6.7.0 and 8.6.3.

The attacker would likely need some level of access to the front-end of the website, potentially even as a low-privileged user, in order to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional details:**
The vulnerabilities are only applicable to AcyMailing Enterprise edition when a front-end campaign management menu has been created in a Joomla website. These vulnerabilities were patched in version 8.7.0.
