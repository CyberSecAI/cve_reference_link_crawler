{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks CSRF protection when updating its settings, combined with insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browser of any admin user who views those settings. This can lead to a complete compromise of the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that targets the vulnerable plugin's settings update endpoint. When a logged-in administrator visits this page, the form is automatically submitted, changing the plugin settings with the attacker's payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to induce a logged-in administrator to visit the attacker-controlled webpage. No other special privileges or access is required."
