{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `formSetPPTPServer` function in Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.05 firmware uses `sscanf` to parse the `startIP` parameter and then uses `sprintf` to copy the parsed values into a local stack variable without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow",
    "Insufficient input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "By providing a crafted `startIP` parameter with a length exceeding the buffer's capacity, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, potentially gaining control over the program's execution flow and executing arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/goform/SetPptpServerCfg` with a maliciously crafted `startIP` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected device's web interface."
