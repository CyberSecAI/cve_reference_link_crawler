Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21114:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of `AttributionSource` objects in the Wi-Fi module, specifically when unparcelling or creating them outside of a Binder transaction or thread.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unparceling or creating `AttributionSource` objects outside the context of a Binder transaction can lead to exceptions.
- Specifically, in `WifiRtt`, `WifiAware`, and `WifiP2p` components of the Wi-Fi module, there were instances where `AttributionSource` objects were being handled in ways that would trigger these exceptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a local escalation of privilege, as stated in the Android Security Bulletin. This is related to how the `AttributionSource` is used for access control. Although not detailed, the improper handling could lead to bypassing access restrictions within the Wi-Fi subsystem.
- The described vulnerability could potentially cause the Wi-Fi service to crash due to exceptions being thrown during the handling of `AttributionSource`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have the capability to interact with the Wi-Fi subsystem.
- The attacker would need to trigger the conditions where `AttributionSource` is improperly handled (unparceled or created outside of binder transactions) within the affected components of the Wi-Fi module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the device is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- An attacker would need to have a malicious application running locally, which has access to the Wi-Fi system service.
- The attacker would have to trigger the vulnerable code paths within the `WifiRtt`, `WifiAware`, or `WifiP2p` components.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the code to ensure that `AttributionSource` objects are only unparceled or created within a Binder transaction or thread.
- The commits provided involve refactoring the `WifiRtt`, `WifiAware`, and `WifiP2p` components to avoid handling `AttributionSource` outside of the required context.

The provided commits and the security bulletin indicate that the issue is present in Android 13 and that it can lead to local EoP. The commits associated with the CVE show how the code was changed to avoid the vulnerability.
