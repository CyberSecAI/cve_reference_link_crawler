```
Auth has removal was broken in a number of cases for all 4.2 versions:
- All queries that returned the object text for a mntner when
  all hash names (MD5-PW etc.) in the text were lower or mixed case
- Queries for the auth attribute in GraphQL queries
- Queries for the objectText for journal entries in GraphQL queries

Further details in 4.2.3 release notes.

Note that this commit only has the fix and tests or coverage may
fail without the subsequent update to the tests.
