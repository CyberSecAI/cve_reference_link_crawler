Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of password hashes in specific IRRd query responses and database exports. This occurs because the `remove_auth_hashes` function was not consistently applied in all cases where password hashes could be exposed. Specifically, the filtering logic failed when password hash names were in lower or mixed case and in certain GraphQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Data Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the incomplete removal of password hashes before query responses or exports are returned.
- **Case Sensitivity Issue:** The hash removal logic was case-sensitive, failing to remove hashes when they were not in all uppercase.
- **Inconsistent Application:** The filtering logic was not consistently applied in all relevant code paths, particularly in GraphQL queries and journal entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially retrieve password hashes associated with `mntner` objects.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining password hashes, attackers could attempt brute-force attacks to obtain the cleartext passwords, allowing them to make unauthorized changes to affected IRR objects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Database Queries:** Exploitation is possible through database queries when hash names are in lower or mixed case.
- **GraphQL Queries:** Attackers could use GraphQL queries to specifically target the `auth` field of `mntner` objects or the `objectText` field of journal entries.
- **Database Exports:** Exporting databases with the `export_destination` setting could also expose the hashes if not filtered properly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the IRRd instance to perform queries.
- **Knowledge of IRRd:** Attackers need to have knowledge of how to query IRRd, specifically the `mntner` object structure and the way the `auth` attribute is handled.
- **Ability to Brute Force:** Successful exploitation requires the ability to perform brute-force password cracking on the obtained hashes to gain the plaintext password.
- **Access to a non-mirror authoritative IRRd instance**:  Only IRRd instances that process password hashes are affected, this limits it to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases; instances operating as mirrors are not affected.
- The commit logs and advisory provide good details of the specific areas of code that were patched to resolve the vulnerability.
- The provided files show the changes made to `irrd/server/graphql/resolvers.py` and `irrd/utils/text.py` to address this vulnerability.
- The advisory includes a CVSS score of 7.5 which indicates a high severity.
- The advisory references CWE-212 which maps to Insufficiently Protected Credentials.
