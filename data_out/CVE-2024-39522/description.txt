An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved commands allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges to escalate their privileges to 'root' leading to a full compromise of the system.

The Junos OS Evolved CLI doesn't properly handle command options in some cases, allowing users which execute specific CLI commands with a crafted set of parameters to escalate their privileges to root on shell level.


This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:



  *  22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R2-EVO,
  *  22.4-EVO versions before 22.4R1-S1-EVO, 22.4R2-EVO.
