- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an authenticated remote attacker to conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through the affected device. The attacker can send arbitrary network requests that are sourced from the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: By uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities through the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid Administrator level privileges on the affected device.
