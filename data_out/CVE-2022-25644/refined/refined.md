Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization in the `getProcessByName` function of the `@pendo324/get-process-by-name` npm package. This allows for the injection of arbitrary commands within the function's execution context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is that user-supplied input to the `getProcessByName` function is not properly sanitized, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code through command injection.
*   **Command Injection:** By injecting shell commands within the process name argument, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Total loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information on the system.
*   **Total loss of Integrity:** An attacker can modify or delete system files.
*   **Total loss of Availability:** An attacker can cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted input to the vulnerable function. The attacker does not need local access to the system.
*   **Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious shell commands through the `getProcessByName` function's input argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any interaction from the user of the vulnerable application to succeed.
*   The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely as long as they can interact with a service that uses the vulnerable package

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `@pendo324/get-process-by-name` package
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating the injection of a command that creates a file `rce.txt`.
*   The Snyk analysis rates this vulnerability as **critical** with a CVSS score of 9.8.
