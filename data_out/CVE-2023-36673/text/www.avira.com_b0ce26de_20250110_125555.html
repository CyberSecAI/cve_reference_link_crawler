### Challenge

You find it creepy that having googled for a new car, you now find yourself inundated with car-related ads.

### P2P Sharing

### Challenge

Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) doesn’t like P2P sharing, so when they see you using it, your ISP can slow down your internet speed down.

### Security

### Challenge

You love working from your favorite coffee shop, or frequently travel and connect to public hotspots. But you know that whether at the cafe, airport, or hotel, none of these networks are secure, so even an amateur can access your private data.

## Why should you use a VPN?

**Stay safe on public Wi-Fi networks**

Surfing online is inherently insecure, especially when connected to a public Wi-Fi network. The reason: other people in this network can access and steal your data. Browse anonymously with an active VPN connection to encrypt all the data received and sent and protect yourself from hackers. This way, your passwords and personal data are safe. The encryption feature is important when you connect to Wi-Fi in a restaurant, cafe, hotel, the airport, or any other public network.

**Protect your data and privacy**

While surfing, you leave traces and companies track your activities for targeted advertising or to collect and sell information about you. Establish a free VPN connection to browse anonymously online, protect your privacy, and prevent advertisers from targeting you. The IP address of your device is hidden, and others cannot monitor your activities.

**Use online banking securely**

Online banking on the go is very convenient. When travelling, you might even use public Wi-Fi networks. The unfortunate truth is that sometimes these connections are less secure and may be exploited. The added security of a connection via VPN means that your sensitive data, such as bank or credit card information, passwords, and private e-mails are kept safe, at home or on the go.

**Bypass geo-restrictions with Avira Phantom VPN Pro**

[Avira Phantom VPN Pro](https://www.avira.com/en/vpn-pro) enables you to choose a custom location, giving you access to geo-restricted content. By picking one of our 150 servers in 37 countries around the world and [hiding your real IP address](https://www.avira.com/en/change-ip), you can easily browse from a different virtual location, bypassing geo-restrictions and regional censorship.

## Avira Phantom VPN: Free VPN for Mac and Windows devices as well as Android and iOS smartphones and tablets

#### [Strengthen your online security and privacy when surfing — even on public Wi-Fi hotspots](#collapse-15-1)

In an age of increasing cybercrime, there’s a widespread risk of unauthorized people gaining access to your banking details, photos, or documents over public Wi-Fi hotspots — whether you’re checking your emails in your hotel room with your laptop, sharing photos with your family using your smartphone, or utilizing the time spent waiting at the airport shopping online. That’s because public Wi-Fi hotspots are often unsecured, acting as a gateway for hackers on the same network who can use them to perform dirty cyberdeeds like launching a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/man-in-the-middle-mitm-attacks). This makes it all the more important to use a free VPN when you’re out and about when [banking online](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/how-secure-is-online-banking-from-hackers-attacks).

### What actually is a VPN?

VPN is short for virtual private network — a type of network that allows you to surf the internet more securely and anonymously. To do this, the VPN or the app creates an encrypted tunnel on your computer, tablet, or smartphone to a VPN server that connects your device to the internet. We give a brief explanation below, but if you want more details, check out our blogpost to learn more about [how a VPN works](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/a-vpn-helps-protect-your-online-privacy-and-make-surfing-more-secure).

### How does a VPN work?

A VPN redirects your online traffic through an external VPN server. This means that from this point on, all the data you send and receive is routed through this encrypted VPN tunnel. An encryption protocol prevents hackers, internet service providers (ISPs), and other companies from accessing your data. The VPN software also swaps your device’s IP address with the address of the VPN server, giving you a new virtual location. So when you now surf the internet, you do so cloaked behind the VPN server’s IP address. This makes it almost impossible to identify you and helps you better protect your online privacy.

### What are the benefits of a free VPN?

Given the constant rise in cybercrime, you should take appropriate measures to protect any sensitive data you transmit online. This list is longer than you might think and includes such things as bank account and credit card details, access details for your various online user accounts, and your email communications. By encrypting everything you send and receive using our free VPN software or app, third parties can no longer snoop on your data. This prevents advertisers or other businesses from tracking what you get up to online.

**Here’s why it’s worth downloading our free VPN:**

* **Protect your sensitive data from unauthorized access**

If you're answering emails over a public hotspot, you'll obviously want to make sure no one else can read them. Avira Phantom VPN technology helps you encrypt your online data traffic and prevent unauthorized snooping. Check out our blog post for further [security tips for using public Wi-Fi hotspots](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/security-tips-for-public-wi-fi-hotspots).

* **Surf anonymously & prevent online tracking of your activities**

Thanks to our free VPN, you can protect your online activities from tracking and monitoring. You can surf anonymously because you mask your true IP address and leave no trace on the internet.

* **Greater online freedom when out and about**

Using Avira Phantom VPN is a reliable and convenient way to access your favorite websites and streaming services more securely when on the move.

* **Increased Wi-Fi security for online banking on public networks**

A free VPN means your passwords and other confidential information cannot be intercepted, read, or manipulated on public Wi-Fi hotspots. By encrypting all your traffic, you can also surf more securely over public hotspots in restaurants or at airports.

#### [Is getting a VPN a wise move for everyone?](#collapse-16-1)

A free VPN like Avira Phantom VPN is a good choice for anyone who wants to surf anonymously and protect their sensitive information when on the internet. That’s because the VPN encrypts a device’s data traffic using bank-grade encryption and routes everything through a private tunnel. This allows you to protect your data from cybercriminals snooping on it even when banking or shopping online using unsecured public Wi-Fi hotspots. A VPN also changes your device’s IP address and assigns a new virtual location so your online activities can’t be traced.

#### [How secure is my VPN connection?](#collapse-16-2)

Avira Phantom VPN uses AES 256 (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is currently the global norm. This is a symmetrical encryption scheme that’s one of the most widely used secure encryption methods. The number 256 refers to the key length in bits. The higher the number, the more possible combinations of digits there are — in this case 2^256. In the USA, for example, AES 256 is approved for government documents with the highest level of secrecy. [Avira Phantom VPN Pro](https://www.avira.com/en/vpn-pro) for Windows also has an emergency off or kill switch feature that automatically disconnects your device from the internet if the VPN connection is interrupted, providing even greater security.

#### [How fast is a VPN?](#collapse-16-3)

A VPN connection is always a bit slower than a regular internet connection due to data traffic redirection, encryption, and the protocol. The speed of the VPN connection depends largely on the data transfer rate or bandwidth offered by the internet service provider. Your distance from the server you connect to (or the country in which the server is located) also plays a role. When using Avira Phantom VPN, however, this drop in speed shouldn’t impact your online experience.

#### [What actually is a VPN?](#collapse-16-4)

VPN is short for virtual private network — a type of network that allows you to surf the internet more securely and anonymously. To do this, the VPN (such as the free Avira Phantom VPN) creates an encrypted tunnel on your computer, tablet, or smartphone to a VPN server that connects your device to the internet. In addition, your device’s assigned IP address is swapped with that of the VPN server, masking your true location.

#### [How secure are public Wi-Fi hotspots?](#collapse-16-5)

Public Wi-Fi hotspots are often unprotected, meaning they’re not very secure. However, by downloading and turning on a free VPN, you can really strengthen your security when using these networks.
