{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The VPN client sends traffic outside the protected VPN tunnel due to routing exceptions for traffic sent to and from the VPN server. An attacker can spoof the IP address of the VPN server by manipulating the DNS response before the VPN is enabled. This causes the VPN client to add a routing rule that sends traffic to the spoofed IP address outside the VPN tunnel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "VPN clients are not properly validating the IP address of the VPN server, allowing a spoofed IP to be used.",
      "VPN clients have a routing exception for traffic to the VPN server's IP address to prevent re-encryption. This exception is exploited."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can intercept and read traffic intended to be protected by the VPN. This can expose sensitive information and allow the attacker to identify websites a user is visiting.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks on a local network (e.g., malicious Wi-Fi hotspot).",
        "DNS spoofing, either through control of a malicious Wi-Fi or Ethernet network, or through control of a malicious ISP or compromised core Internet router."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to spoof DNS replies before the VPN is enabled, and be able to see traffic to the VPN server. This can be achieved by controlling a Wi-Fi or Ethernet network or by being a malicious ISP or having control over a compromised core Internet router."
  },
  "affected_systems": [
    "Built-in VPN clients of Windows, macOS, and iOS.",
    "A significant number of Linux VPNs.",
    "OpenVPN profiles (when used with a vulnerable VPN client that uses a hostname to identify the VPN server)."
