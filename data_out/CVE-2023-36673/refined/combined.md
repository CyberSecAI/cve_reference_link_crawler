## [Introduction](#intro)

8 August 2023 —
This website presents TunnelCrack, a combination of two widespread security vulnerabilities
in VPNs.
Although a VPN is supposed to protect all data that a user transmits,
our attacks can bypass the protection of a VPN.
For instance, an adversary can abuse our vulnerabilities to leak and read user traffic, steal user
information, or attack user devices.
Our tests indicate that **every VPN product is vulnerable on at least one device**.

We found that VPNs for iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and macOS are extremely likely to be vulnerable, that a majority of VPNs on Windows and Linux are vulnerable, and that Android is the most secure with roughly one-quarter of VPN apps being vulnerable.

The discovered vulnerabilities can be abused regardless of the security protocol used by the VPN.
In other words, even VPNs that claim they use "military grade encryption" or that use self-developed encryption
protocols can be attacked.
The root cause of both vulnerabilities has been part of VPNs since their first creation around 1996.
This means that our **vulnerabilities went unnoticed, at least publicly, for more than two decades**.

Our first set of vulnerabilities, called LocalNet attacks, can be exploited when a user connects to an
untrusted Wi-Fi network. Our second set of vulnerabilities, called ServerIP attacks, can be exploited
by untrusted Wi-Fi networks *and* by malicious Internet service providers.
Both attacks manipulate the victim's routing table to **trick the victim into
sending traffic outside the protected VPN tunnel**, allowing an adversary to read and intercept
transmitted traffic.

To protect users, security updates were prepared during a 90-days coordinated disclosure in collaboration
with CERT/CC and various VPN vendors.

Some example patched VPNs are
[Mozilla VPN](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/),
[Surfshark](https://surfshark.com/),
[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/vpn),
[Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/) (can import OpenVPN profiles),
and [Cloudflare's WARP](https://1.1.1.1/).

If updates for
your VPN are not available, you can mitigate the LocalNet attack by disabling local network access.
You can also mitigate attacks by assuring websites use HTTPS, which many websites nowadays support.

Our research will be presented at the [USENIX Security](#usenixpres)
conference on 11 August 2023. The research was carried out by Nian Xue (New York University), Yashaswi Malla,
Zihang Xia, Christina Pöpper (New York University Abu Dhabi), and Mathy Vanhoef (KU Leuven University).
You can contact [Mathy Vanhoef](#contact) for any questions.

## [Demo](#demo)

The video below shows three examples of how an adversary can abuse the discovered vulnerabilities.
First, the LocalNet attack is abused to make the victim leak traffic. This is used to intercept sensitive info sent to insecure websites, e.g., the victim's username and password is leaked.
We also show how an adversary can identify which websites someone is visiting, which is normally not possible when using a VPN.
Finally, a variant of the LocalNet attack is abused to block a security camera from notifying the user of unexpected movements.

As the demo illustrates, the VPN flaws can be abused to trivially leak traffic and
identify the websites that someone is visiting. Additionally, any data sent to improperly configured websites, or sent by insecure apps, can be intercepted.

Users can defend themselves by updating their VPN software. Additionally, when a website is properly configured with
[HSTS](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/websites-hsts) to always
use [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) as an extra layer of security, which nowadays around
[25%](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-hsts) of websites are,
any transmitted data cannot be stolen.
Moreover, several browsers now [warn](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/milestone-chrome-security-marking-http-not-secure)
the user when HTTPS is not being used.
Finally, although [not always](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/oltrogge) perfect,
modern mobile apps by default use HTTPS and therefore also use this extra protection.

Apart from targeting websites, another risk is that VPNs are often used to protect older or insecure protocols.
Our attacks now enable an adversary to remove the protection offered by a VPN, meaning adversaries can subsequently attack
any older or insecure protocols used by the victim, such as RDP, POP, FTP, telnet, and so on.

## [Details](#details)

### [Background and core idea](#summary)

The core idea behind our attacks is to manipulate the VPN client into sending traffic outside the protected VPN tunnel. By doing so, the victim's traffic can be read and intercepted. Under normal conditions, the client’s
[routing table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table) assures
that all traffic will be sent, i.e., routed, through the protected VPN tunnel. However,
many VPN clients add exceptions to send the following two types of traffic outside the VPN tunnel:

1. Traffic sent to and from the local network; and
2. Traffic sent to and from the VPN server.

The first routing rule assures that the local network remains accessible while using the VPN, meaning the user can enable the VPN
while simultaneously printing files, performing screen casting to their TV, and so on. The second routing rule assures that
there is no routing loop, i.e., that already-encrypted VPN packets do not undergo encryption again.
Unfortunately, we
discovered that an adversary can manipulate these routing exceptions such that arbitrary traffic will be sent outside the
VPN tunnel.

In our LocalNet attacks, the adversary acts as a malicious Wi-Fi network and pretends that websites and Internet servers are directly reachable in the local Wi-Fi network. This causes traffic leakage due to the "send local traffic outside the VPN tunnel" rule.
In our ServerIP attacks, an adversary changes, i.e., spoofs, the IP address of the VPN server. This causes traffic leakage due to the "send traffic to the IP address of the VPN server outside the VPN tunnel" rule.

### [LocalNet Attacks](#localnetdetails "CVE-2023-36672 and CVE-2023-35838")

In the LocalNet attack, the adversary acts as a malicious Wi-Fi or Ethernet network, and tricks the victim into connecting to this network.
An easy way to accomplish this is by cloning a popular Wi-Fi hotspot such as "starbucks".
When a victim connects to this malicious network, the **adversary assigns a public IP address and subnet** to the victim.
The figure below shows an example of this, where the adversary's goal is to intercept traffic towards the website target.com:

In the above figure, the website target.com has the IP address 1.2.3.4. To intercept traffic to this website, the adversary tells the victim that the local network is using the subnet 1.2.3.0/24. In other words, the victim is informed that IP addresses in the range 1.2.3.1-254 are directly reachable in the local network.
When the victim now visits target.com, a web request will be sent to the IP address 1.2.3.4.
Because the victim thinks that this IP address is directly reachable in the local network,
it will send the web request outside the protected VPN tunnel.

An adversary can also assign larger subnets to the local network to leak nearly all of the victim's traffic.
Additionally, although the main goal of the LocalNet attack is to leak traffic outside the VPN tunnel,
the attack can also be abused to block selected traffic while the VPN is being used (see [our paper](#paper) for details) .

We tested more than 66 VPN apps on five platforms and found that **all VPN apps on iOS are vulnerable**.
Additionally, all but one VPN client on macOS is vulnerable, on Windows a large majority of VPNs are vulnerably, and on Linux more than one-third are vulnerable. Interestingly, **VPN apps on Android are typically the most secure**, with one-quarter being vulnerable to the LocalNet attack. We conjecture that this is because Android has a more carefully designed API to create VPN apps.

To defend against the attack, the VPN app should automatically disable local network access when the local network is using public IP addresses.
On most platforms this can be easily implemented.
On iOS this can be done by using the includeAllNetworks and excludeLocalNetworks APIs.
Some vendors reported reliability issues when using these APIs, making some them hesitant to adopt this defense.
Ideally, Apple should create a more robust API for VPNs on iOS, or implement a more secure behaviour by default,
so that VPN apps can be implemented more securely without needing knowledge of these API parameters.

### [ServerIP Attacks](#serveripdetails "CVE-2023-36673 and CVE-2023-36671")

In the ServerIP attacks, the attacker must be able to spoof DNS replies before the VPN is enabled,
and must be able to see traffic to the VPN server. Similar to the LocalNet attacks, this can be
accomplished by acting as a malicious Wi-Fi or Ethernet network. The attacks can also be carried out by
a malicious ISP or compromised core Internet router.

The core idea is that the **adversary spoofs the IP address of the VPN server**.
For example, if the VPN server is identified by the hostname vpn.com and its real IP address is 2.2.2.2, then the
adversary can spoof the DNS response to have a different IP address. The following figure shows an example of this,
where the adversary's goal is to intercept traffic towards target.com which has the IP address 1.2.3.4:

The adversary first spoofs the DNS reply for vpn.com to return the IP address 1.2.3.4, which equals the IP address
of target.com. In other words, we spoof the IP address that we want to leak traffic towards. The victim will then
connect with the VPN server at 1.2.3.4. To assure the victim still
successfully creates a VPN connection, the adversary redirects this traffic to the real VPN server.
As a result, even though the victim is using the wrong IP address for the VPN server, the VPN tunnel is still
successfully created. Moreover, the victim will add a routing rule so that all traffic to 1.2.3.4 is sent
outside the VPN tunnel.

When the victim now visits target.com, a web request is sent to 1.2.3.4. Due to the routing rule to
prevent re-encryption of packets to the VPN server, this request is sent outside the
protected VPN tunnel. As a result, the web request is leaked.

We found that the built-in VPN clients of Windows, macOS, and iOS are vulnerable. Android 12 and higher is not affected.
A significant number of Linux VPNs are also vulnerable. Additionally, we found that most OpenVPN profiles, when used
with a vulnerable VPN client, use a hostname to identify the VPN server and therefore may result in vulnerable behavior.
For more details about the ServerIP experiments, see [our paper](#paper).
To prevent the attack, VPN clients should be updated to send all traffic through the VPN tunnel, except traffic
generated by the VPN app itself.

### [Discussion](#discussion)

Our attacks are not computationally expensive, meaning anyone with the appropriate network access can perform
them, and they are independent of the VPN protocol being used. Overall, our attacks break the security and anonymity
that VPNs are expected to provide. Even if the victim is using another layer of encryption such as HTTPS, our attacks reveal
which websites a user is visiting, which can be a significant privacy risk. Moreover, the leaked traffic can contain
sensitive data if older insecure protocols are used, and our attack can be used as a basis to attack such older protocols.

We believe that one reason why these routing manipulation vulnerabilities were only discovered more than two decades
after the introduction of VPNs, is that most previous works focused on the VPN protocols themselves, but only few studied
their integration into real-world clients and platforms. In other words, our attacks show that properly integrating VPNs
into a platform, and securely managing the routing table, is essential for security.

Our results also show that the security of VPN clients practically always depends on the Operating System (OS), meaning one
must always take into account the OS when discussing the security of a VPN product or brand. We also believe that the OS should
provide a straightforward and secure API to configure and start VPN clients. This avoids each VPN having to implement its
own or routing table code on each supported OS, which should increase overall security. For instance, Android has one
of the more robust APIs to enable a VPN, and this is one explanation why VPN clients are typically more secure on Android.

### [Assigned CVE identifiers](#cves)

Our findings were tracked by CERT/CC under the identifier [VU#563667](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/563667).
Our attacks got assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

* [CVE-2023-36672](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36672): LocalNet attack resulting in leakage of traffic in plaintext. The reference CVSS score is [6.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N&version=3.1).
* [CVE-2023-35838](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35838): LocalNet attack resulting in the blocking of traffic. The reference CVSS score is [3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L&version=3.1).
* [CVE-2023-36673](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36673): ServerIP attack, combined with DNS spoofing, that can leak traffic to arbitrary IP address. The reference CVSS score is [7.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N&version=3.1).
* [CVE-2023-36671](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36671): ServerIP attack where only traffic to the real IP address of the VPN server can be leaked. The reference CVSS score is [3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1).

Note that these are reference CVE identifiers.
Normally each affected codebase receives a unique CVE,
but the agreement between affected vendors was that, in this specific case,
using the same CVE across different codebases would make communication easier.
For instance, by tying one CVE to each vulnerability, a customer can now ask a vendor
whether their product is affected by a specific CVE.

Please note that this deviates from normal MITRE guidelines, and that this decision was made
by affected vendors independently of MITRE, and that this in no way reflects any changes
in how MITRE assigns CVEs.

### [Paper Clarifications](#papernotes)

* Table 1 (Appendix): during our tests Mullvad on Android was always secure against the LocalNet attack, no matter what the LAN setting was, and should therefore have a green checkmark.
* In Section 5.6.5 regarding Cisco AnyConnect, during the disclosure we were only able to replicate the leakage of packets on port 443. There were no observed leaks on other ports.
* In Section 6.1.1 regarding defenses to the LocalNet attack, with "Disable local traffic" we don't mean blocking traffic. We mean that traffic to local IP addresses should also be sent through the VPN tunnel.
* In Section 5.4.2 regarding defenses to the LocalNet attack on iOS, before our disclosure only a few vendors used the includeAllNetworks and excludeLocalNetworks API parameters. During the disclosure we recommended usage of the includeAllNetworks parameter to prevent the attack. We remark that the parameter excludeLocalNetworks only has an effect when includeAllNetworks is to True.

### [Presentations](#usenixpres)

The recorded presentation made for USENIX Security can now be viewed online. Note that the target audience
of this presentation are academics and IT professionals:

The longer Black Hat Europe talk can also be viewed online:

## [Tools](#tools)

Our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vanhoefm/vpnleaks) contains instructions on how to
manually test VPN clients. These are the instructions that we also followed while carrying out the research.
During the coordinated disclosure, we also made a more automated script to test VPNs, as can be seen in the
demo. However, to prevent malicious individuals from abusing our testing script to attack users, we will
only release this script once sufficiently many VPNs have been patched.

The LocalNet attack can be easily tested though: configure a router to
use the subnet 216.165.47.0/24 for the local network. Connect to the router, enable the VPN,
and visit http://nyu.edu or http://216.165.47.10. If, while the VPN is enabled, the NYU website won't load
using one of these URLs, then the VPN is likely vulnerable.

A quick method to confirm that a VPN client *cannot* be vulnerable to the ServerIP attack is to enable
the VPN and then use Wireshark to identify the VPN server's IP address. Then visit http://$VPN\_SERVERIP. If you cannot
see plaintext TCP SYNs in Wireshark (use the filter "tcp.flags.syn == 1") then the VPN client cannot be vulnerable.

### [How can I contact you?](#contact)

The research was carried out by Nian Xue (New York University), Yashaswi Malla, Zihang Xia,
Christina Pöpper (New York University Abu Dhabi), and Mathy Vanhoef (KU Leuven University).
You can e-mail Mathy Vanhoef for any questions.

### [How did you discover this?](#howfound)

The initial research idea came from Mathy Vanhoef. To quote him:
"I've wanted to study the security of VPN for a while. Around 9 June 2020, so during the midst of COVID,
I was looking at all the configuration options of OpenVPN for Android. At the time I was living in Abu Dhabi
and using a VPN was common to get access to my computers in Belgium. While randomly scrolling through the
options, I saw the option "Bypass VPN for local networks". Enabling that option allowed you to directly connect
to devices in the local network without going through the VPN. At that moment I realised that some VPN clients
might not check whether the local network is using private IP address. And I realized that an adversary would
then be able to create a rogue Wi-Fi network that advertises public IP address and would then be able to intercept
traffic. I was able to quickly confirm this against my own VPN client. After this initial experiment, we first had
to finished other research, and it took a while before our team could devote our full attention towards VPN research."

### [Can I reuse the images on this website?](#images)

Yes. For instance, you can use the [logo](images/logo.png), illustrations of the [LocalNet](images/localnet.png)
attack ([mobile version](images/localnet_small.png)),
illustrations of the [ServerIP](images/serverip.png) attack ([mobile version](images/serverip_small.png)),
and statistics of the [LocalNet experiments](images/localnetstats.png) ([mobile version](images/localnetstats_small.png)).

Thanks goes to [Darlee Urbiztondo](https://www.thehappylee.com/graphic-design-projects) for designing the logo.

### [Which OpenVPN-capable clients have patched the vulnerabilities?](#openvpnclient)

In case you use OpenVPN servers and profiles, then you can use the open-source [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/)
client and load your OpenVPN profile in Windscribe. You will then be able to use Windscribe with your own server. At the time of
disclosure, the Windscribe client was secure against all attacks on all the platforms that we tested (Windows, Android,
macOS, Linux, iOS).
In contrast, during the disclosure we were not aware of any updates that the OpenVPN Connect client had planned,
meaning we don't know to which extent OpenVPN Connect will prevent our attacks.

### [Why is the disclosure so close to Black Hat and DEF CON?](#bhdefcon)

The research was accepted at USENIX Security. We decided to disclose our research on the
[Patch Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday)
before the start of USENIX Security, which turned out to be Tuesday 8 August 2023.

I only realized while making this website that people will likely be relying on VPNs during
Black Hat and DEF CON (and the other security conferences). And given the large amount of VPN clients that exist,
it might be unclear whether your specific VPN client is already patched and secure.. #oops.

### [Was ClarioVPN informed of the vulnerabilities?](#clariovpn)

Yes. The Dubai-based ClarioVPN team was notified about both attacks. The summarized disclosure timeline was:

* 15 April 2023: Initial report about a ServerIP attack variant sent to Clario.
* 5 May 2023: After some discussion, they informed us that MitM attacks are out of scope.
* 8 May 2023: Mathy Vanhoef publicly [tweeted](https://twitter.com/vanhoefm/status/1655769309707370498) that Clario considers MitM attacks against a VPN to be out of scope.
* 12 May 2023: Clario changed the scope of their vulnerability program and now does consider MitM to be in scope for its VPN client. They will forward the report to the appropriate team for review.
* 15 May 2023: Initial report about LocalNet attacks sent to Clario.
* 7 June 2023: They informed us that the LocalNet attack doesn’t seem to have any significant security risk and/or security impact. Clario mentioned that they aren't interested in participating in this "multi-party coordinated disclosure on VPN security".
* 7 June 2023: Informed them that ClarioVPN will be part of the disclosure.
* 21 July 2023: Clario informed us that there appeared to be a miscommunication. They believe the risk to their customers is not low, but medium, and that they are nevertheless going to release fixes.

Note that Mathy Vanhoef handled the disclosure with Clario. Based on his experience, and their reaction,
he doesn't consider ClarioVPN to be a trustworthy VPN.

### [Was Ivanti informed of the vulnerabilities?](#ivanti)

Yes.

### [Is Window's built-in VPN also vulnerable?](#windows)

Yes, it's vulnerable to both the LocalNet and ServerIP attacks. Microsoft is not planning to release patches.

The disclosure timeline for the ServerIP attack was:

* 8 May 2023: Initial report send to Microsoft.
* 14 July 2023: They asked if our research would be presented at Black Hat. We informed then that both the ServerIP and LocalNet attacks will be presented at USENIX Security.
* 7 August 2023: Microsoft informed us this behavior is by design, the barrier-to-entry to mount this attack is high. Microsoft claims that after the VPN tunnel is established, a MitM won't be able to decapsulate content (while in our opinion the attack is about making the victim leak traffic, not the 'decapsulation' of encrypted traffic). They also mentioned that with a forced tunnel such an attack is not possible because DNS is then also tunneled (in our attack DNS is spoofed before the tunnel is established). It's mentioned that traffic will only leak when using a split-tunnel configuration (while our ServerIP attack can also make a full tunnel VPN leak traffic). It's also mentioned that the attack makes the assumption that TLS-based DNS protocols are not in use (by default they were never used by the Windows platforms that we tested). They mentioned this case will be closed.
* 7 August 2023: We briefly replied that they seemed to have misunderstood the attack.
* 8 August 2023: Public disclosure as planned.

The disclosure timeline for the LocalNet attack was:

* 11 May 2023: Initial report send to Microsoft.
* 7 August 2023: Microsoft answered that this doesn't meet the bar for an immediate and urgent fix in an upcoming Security Patch update. It's mentioned that if an attacker can hand out "rogue IP addresses" to clients, then network connectivity would be highly likely be broken on the client anyway. They mentioned that therefore, the attack scenario is similar to the ServerIP attacks, where attacks are only possible in a split-tunnel configuration, which they mention is no different to not having a VPN configured for the targeted address ranges. They mentioned this case will be closed.
* 7 August 2023: We briefly replied that they seemed to have misunderstood the attack.
* 8 August 2023: Public disclosure as planned.

We consider it unfortunate that their reply came so late. We hope it's still possible to rectify the misunderstandings
about how the attacks work, or at least to better understand the mismatch between what users expect about a VPN compared
to the actual provided security guarantees of Window's built-in VPN.

### [Why did nobody notice these vulnerabilities before?](#notnoticed)

We think this is because previous research focused on the cryptographic aspects of VPNs, or focused on detecting
typically programming vulnerabilities in VPNs, but up until now no attention was given to the secure integration of
VPNs into a real-world system.

Note that in 2015, Andrew Ayer wrote the guide [Hardening OpenVPN for DEF CON](https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/hardening_openvpn_for_def_con)
which hinted at the LocalNet attack. Following the guide would prevent the LocalNet attack, at least on Linux. However,
the ServerIP attack would still be possible when using domain names. Additionally, the guide did not test any existing
VPN clients, meaning it was unknown whether VPN clients were affected by the LocalNet attack. In our research, where we
tested around 248 VPN clients, we found that a large number of them were (still) vulnerable, and we notified a large number
of affected parties to ensure that their VPN clients will defend against the attack.

### [My VPN client isn't patched yet, what can I do?](#notpatched)

First, it's always good to remember general security best practices: update your devices, don't reuse your passwords,
make sure you have backups of important data, don't visit shady websites, and so on.

In regard to the discovered VPN vulnerabilities, you can mitigate the LocalNet attack by disabling "local network access"
in your VPN client. Unfortunately, not all VPN clients offer such a feature.

### [Why is a VPN still important? These days we can rely on HTTPS.](#whyimportant)

These days a lot of websites and apps use [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) to encrypt data.
When using HTTPS, an adversary cannot see the data you are transmitting even when you are connected to an open Wi-Fi network.
This also means that you can safely use open Wi-Fi hotspots as long as you keep your devices up-to-date and as long as you assure
that websites are using HTTPS. Unfortunately, not all websites require the usage of HTTPS (i.e. they're not using
[HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)), meaning they remain
vulnerable to possible attacks.

When only relying on HTTPS, it's also easy for an adversary to determine which websites you visit. There is research
work that can also determine exactly which webpage you're visiting on an HTTPS website. So although HTTPS protects
the data that you are transmitting, it does not hide *who* you are sending it to. And that on its own can be
sensitive information.

### [How sure are you that every VPN is vulnerable on at least one device?](#allaffected)

In experiments on more than 75 devices, all of them were vulnerable to one or more of the discovered attacks.
I'm curious myself whether *all* devices in the whole world are indeed affected though! To find this out, if you
find a device that isn't affected by at least one of the discovered vulnerabilities, let me know.

Also, if your company provides Wi-Fi devices and you think that your product was not affected by any of the discovered vulnerabilities,
you can send your product to me. Once I confirmed that it indeed was not affected by any vulnerabilities the name of
your product and company will be put here! Note that I do need a method to assure that I'm indeed testing a version
of the product that was available before the disclosure of the vulnerabilities (and that you didn't silently patch
some vulnerabilities).

### [Isn't it irresponsible to release tools to perform the attacks?](#abusetools)

The test tool that we released can only be used to test whether a device is vulnerable. It cannot be used
to perform attacks: an adversary would have to write their own tools for that. This approach enables network
administrators to test if devices are affected while reducing the chance of someone abusing the released code.

### [Where are all the attack tools?](#attacktools)

The code that has currently been released focusses on *detecting* vulnerable implementations. The proof-of-concepts
scripts that perform actual attacks are not released to provide everyone with more time to implement and deploy patches.
Once a large enough fraction of devices has been patched, and if deemed necessary and/or beneficial, the attack script
will be publicly released as well.

### [Why is the LocalNet attack so hard to fix on iOS?](#ioslocalnet)

On iOS this can be prevented by using the includeAllNetworks and excludeLocalNetworks APIs.
Some vendors reported reliability issues when using these APIs, but we were not able to replicate such issues.
Nevertheless, this made some vendors hesitant to adopt this defense.
Ideally, Apple should create a more robust API for VPNs on iOS, or implement a more secure behaviour by default,
so that VPN apps can be implemented more securely without needing knowledge of these API parameters.

### [How did you block selected traffic in the demo?](#demoblock)

By assigning the IP addresses that we wanted to block to the local Wi-Fi network.

### [Why are so many implementations vulnerable to the LocalNet attack?](#localnetmany)

Most users want to be able to access their local network while using a VPN. Unfortunately, we found that this was nearly
always implemented in an insecure manner.

### [Why do you use the same CVE for implementation issues in multiple different codebases?](#samecves)

Implementation-specific vulnerabilities usually get their own independent CVE identifier for each different codebase.
However, because the same implementation issues seem to be present across multiple vendors it would make more sense to have a single CVE identifier
for each common implementation issue.
After all, the main purpose of CVE identifiers is to provide a single, common ID to be used across vendors to identify the same vulnerability.
We therefore think it makes sense to assign only a single CVE identifier to each implementation issues. This enables vendors
and customers to easily reference an implementation vulnerability and, for instance, check whether certain products are affected
by one of the discovered vulnerabilities.

### [Why were not all VPN vendors notified in advance?](#hownotified)

We collaborated with CERT/CC to disclose our results in a coordinated manner. On top of that, we personally also notified
VPN vendors that had an explicit security contact and/or a bug bounty program. Unfortunately, it was practically infeasible
to notify all VPN vendors. Additionally, notifying a large number of VPN vendors increase the risk of the vulnerabilities
becoming public during the embargo, and increases the risk that malicious actors might learn about the vulnerabilities and
abuse them in targeted attacks.

Based on our previous experience with disclosing Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, it would have been very useful if there would have
been an equivalent of the Wi-Fi Alliance but for VPN vendors. Such an organization could then help with multi-party coordinated
disclosures that involve widespread security issues in VPN software.

### [Are these vulnerabilities being exploited in practice?](#beingexploit)

Not that we are aware of. But it is difficult to monitor whether one of the discovered vulnerabilities have
been exploited in the past or are currently being exploited. So it is hard to give a definite answer to this
question.

### [Why did some VPN vendors silently release fixes before the disclosure?](#silentupdates)

During the coordinated disclosure, we gave VPN vendors the option to already release fixes roughly two weeks before
the disclosure, as long as no details of the vulnerability would be made available. Although this creates a risk
that someone might reverse engineer the patches and rediscover certain attacks, we considered this to be unlikely.
The vulnerabilities have been present in VPN clients for more than two decades, and the advantage of getting patches
out on time appeared to outweigh the risk that someone would rediscover the attacks.

### [Isn't nyu.edu using HSTS to prevent these kinds of attacks?](#nyuhsts)

Websites can use [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) to force browsers to always
use HTTPS encryption when visiting a website. This prevents the attack that was shown in our [demo](#href).
Unfortunately, the website of NYU at the time did not properly configure HSTS. More technically, some subdomains such as
globalhome.nyu.edu do instruct the browser to use HSTS by including the following header in responses:

```
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains
```

Unfortunately, other subdomains such as shibboleth.nyu.edu remove HSTS by including the following header in responses:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=0
```

Combined with other configuration decisions, this meant that when a user would type nyu.edu in their browser,
the initial request was sent in plaintext and therefore could be intercepted by an adversary.

Note that NYU was already informed of this HSTS configuration behavior on 4 May 2021.

## Why should you use a VPN?

**Stay safe on public Wi-Fi networks**

Surfing online is inherently insecure, especially when connected to a public Wi-Fi network. The reason: other people in this network can access and steal your data. Browse anonymously with an active VPN connection to encrypt all the data received and sent and protect yourself from hackers. This way, your passwords and personal data are safe. The encryption feature is important when you connect to Wi-Fi in a restaurant, cafe, hotel, the airport, or any other public network.

**Protect your data and privacy**

While surfing, you leave traces and companies track your activities for targeted advertising or to collect and sell information about you. Establish a free VPN connection to browse anonymously online, protect your privacy, and prevent advertisers from targeting you. The IP address of your device is hidden, and others cannot monitor your activities.

**Use online banking securely**

Online banking on the go is very convenient. When travelling, you might even use public Wi-Fi networks. The unfortunate truth is that sometimes these connections are less secure and may be exploited. The added security of a connection via VPN means that your sensitive data, such as bank or credit card information, passwords, and private e-mails are kept safe, at home or on the go.

**Bypass geo-restrictions with Avira Phantom VPN Pro**

[Avira Phantom VPN Pro](https://www.avira.com/en/vpn-pro) enables you to choose a custom location, giving you access to geo-restricted content. By picking one of our 150 servers in 37 countries around the world and [hiding your real IP address](https://www.avira.com/en/change-ip), you can easily browse from a different virtual location, bypassing geo-restrictions and regional censorship.

## Avira Phantom VPN: Free VPN for Mac and Windows devices as well as Android and iOS smartphones and tablets

#### [Strengthen your online security and privacy when surfing — even on public Wi-Fi hotspots](#collapse-15-1)

In an age of increasing cybercrime, there’s a widespread risk of unauthorized people gaining access to your banking details, photos, or documents over public Wi-Fi hotspots — whether you’re checking your emails in your hotel room with your laptop, sharing photos with your family using your smartphone, or utilizing the time spent waiting at the airport shopping online. That’s because public Wi-Fi hotspots are often unsecured, acting as a gateway for hackers on the same network who can use them to perform dirty cyberdeeds like launching a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/man-in-the-middle-mitm-attacks). This makes it all the more important to use a free VPN when you’re out and about when [banking online](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/how-secure-is-online-banking-from-hackers-attacks).

### What actually is a VPN?

VPN is short for virtual private network — a type of network that allows you to surf the internet more securely and anonymously. To do this, the VPN or the app creates an encrypted tunnel on your computer, tablet, or smartphone to a VPN server that connects your device to the internet. We give a brief explanation below, but if you want more details, check out our blogpost to learn more about [how a VPN works](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/a-vpn-helps-protect-your-online-privacy-and-make-surfing-more-secure).

### How does a VPN work?

A VPN redirects your online traffic through an external VPN server. This means that from this point on, all the data you send and receive is routed through this encrypted VPN tunnel. An encryption protocol prevents hackers, internet service providers (ISPs), and other companies from accessing your data. The VPN software also swaps your device’s IP address with the address of the VPN server, giving you a new virtual location. So when you now surf the internet, you do so cloaked behind the VPN server’s IP address. This makes it almost impossible to identify you and helps you better protect your online privacy.

### What are the benefits of a free VPN?

Given the constant rise in cybercrime, you should take appropriate measures to protect any sensitive data you transmit online. This list is longer than you might think and includes such things as bank account and credit card details, access details for your various online user accounts, and your email communications. By encrypting everything you send and receive using our free VPN software or app, third parties can no longer snoop on your data. This prevents advertisers or other businesses from tracking what you get up to online.

**Here’s why it’s worth downloading our free VPN:**

* **Protect your sensitive data from unauthorized access**

If you're answering emails over a public hotspot, you'll obviously want to make sure no one else can read them. Avira Phantom VPN technology helps you encrypt your online data traffic and prevent unauthorized snooping. Check out our blog post for further [security tips for using public Wi-Fi hotspots](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/security-tips-for-public-wi-fi-hotspots).

* **Surf anonymously & prevent online tracking of your activities**

Thanks to our free VPN, you can protect your online activities from tracking and monitoring. You can surf anonymously because you mask your true IP address and leave no trace on the internet.

* **Greater online freedom when out and about**

Using Avira Phantom VPN is a reliable and convenient way to access your favorite websites and streaming services more securely when on the move.

* **Increased Wi-Fi security for online banking on public networks**

A free VPN means your passwords and other confidential information cannot be intercepted, read, or manipulated on public Wi-Fi hotspots. By encrypting all your traffic, you can also surf more securely over public hotspots in restaurants or at airports.

#### [Is getting a VPN a wise move for everyone?](#collapse-16-1)

A free VPN like Avira Phantom VPN is a good choice for anyone who wants to surf anonymously and protect their sensitive information when on the internet. That’s because the VPN encrypts a device’s data traffic using bank-grade encryption and routes everything through a private tunnel. This allows you to protect your data from cybercriminals snooping on it even when banking or shopping online using unsecured public Wi-Fi hotspots. A VPN also changes your device’s IP address and assigns a new virtual location so your online activities can’t be traced.

#### [How secure is my VPN connection?](#collapse-16-2)

Avira Phantom VPN uses AES 256 (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is currently the global norm. This is a symmetrical encryption scheme that’s one of the most widely used secure encryption methods. The number 256 refers to the key length in bits. The higher the number, the more possible combinations of digits there are — in this case 2^256. In the USA, for example, AES 256 is approved for government documents with the highest level of secrecy. [Avira Phantom VPN Pro](https://www.avira.com/en/vpn-pro) for Windows also has an emergency off or kill switch feature that automatically disconnects your device from the internet if the VPN connection is interrupted, providing even greater security.

#### [How fast is a VPN?](#collapse-16-3)

A VPN connection is always a bit slower than a regular internet connection due to data traffic redirection, encryption, and the protocol. The speed of the VPN connection depends largely on the data transfer rate or bandwidth offered by the internet service provider. Your distance from the server you connect to (or the country in which the server is located) also plays a role. When using Avira Phantom VPN, however, this drop in speed shouldn’t impact your online experience.

#### [What actually is a VPN?](#collapse-16-4)

VPN is short for virtual private network — a type of network that allows you to surf the internet more securely and anonymously. To do this, the VPN (such as the free Avira Phantom VPN) creates an encrypted tunnel on your computer, tablet, or smartphone to a VPN server that connects your device to the internet. In addition, your device’s assigned IP address is swapped with that of the VPN server, masking your true location.

#### [How secure are public Wi-Fi hotspots?](#collapse-16-5)

Public Wi-Fi hotspots are often unprotected, meaning they’re not very secure. However, by downloading and turning on a free VPN, you can really strengthen your security when using these networks. A VPN program or app like Avira Phantom VPN encrypts all the data you send and receive on your device, so you can surf more securely and anonymously.
