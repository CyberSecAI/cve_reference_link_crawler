General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following cybersecurity best practices.

•  Device should only be used in a personal home network.
•  Device should not have a publicly accessible IP address.
•  Do NOT use port forwarding to access a device from the public internet.
•  A device should be on its own network segment. If your router supports a guest network

or VLAN, it is preferable to locate the device there.

•  Use the strongest Wi-Fi encryption available in the home Wi-Fi network, such as WPA3

or WPA2/3 with protected management frames.

•  Schedule regular reboots of your routing device, smartphones, and computers.
•  Ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain physical access to your devices or
regularly inspect the device for visual clues that may reveal a tampering attempt.
