- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information (test credentials) within the firmware binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information. The firmware binary contains test credentials in cleartext.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Disclosure of confidential information. Although the notification claims that this information is related to remote test equipment and test features removed from production units, it still constitutes a potential risk for sensitive data exposure.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access. The CVSS score indicates "AV:L" (local attack vector). The credentials could be extracted from the firmware binary if the attacker gains access to the firmware.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have local access to the firmware binary. No specific user privileges are mentioned as "PR:N" is specified, so any user can attempt to get the firmware and extract the credentials.
