The provided content relates to CVE-2023-40984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Replace in Results" feature of the File Manager module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary malicious JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the Webmin administrative interface, specifically via the File Manager's search and replace function. An attacker needs to craft a malicious payload and inject it into the "Replace in Results" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have access to the Webmin administrative interface. This could be through having valid credentials or by exploiting another vulnerability to gain access. They must also be able to navigate to the File Manager module and use its search functionality.
