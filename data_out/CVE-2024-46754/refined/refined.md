Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-46754.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `bpf_test_run()` function could be used to invoke the lwt_seg6 related BPF operations without first entering `input_action_end_bpf()`. This occurs because the `seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh` per-CPU variable was not assigned during self-test cases. However, the BPF functions expect this variable to be set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect BPF program testing allowed invocation of BPF ops without proper setup.
- The self-test case for `BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL` did not correctly initialize the `seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh` variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The `bpf_test_run()` could invoke the BPF programs in an unexpected state due to the uninitialized `seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh` variable. While the provided text doesn't explicitly describe the precise impact, the missing initialization could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `bpf_test_run()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to invoke the `bpf_test_run()` function. This would typically require root or CAP_BPF capabilities.

**Additional Notes**
The fix removes the `.test_run = bpf_prog_test_run_skb` from the `lwt_seg6local_prog_ops` structure for `BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL`.
This prevents direct invocation of BPF programs associated with this type using `bpf_test_run`, forcing a proper setup through `input_action_end_bpf()`.
