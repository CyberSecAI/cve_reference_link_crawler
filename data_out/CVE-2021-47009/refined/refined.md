The provided content relates to a fix for a memory leak vulnerability, specifically within the `trusted_tpm1.c` file of the Linux kernel's trusted keys subsystem. This vulnerability is addressed by commit `83a775d5f9bfda95b1c295f95a3a041a40c7f321`, which is then backported to stable kernel branches via commits `3e24fbd37e72e8a67b74991970fecc82d14f57af`, `31c9a4b24d86cbb36ff0d7a085725a3b4f0138c8`, and `1c4031014106aff48e1e686e40101c31eab5d44c`.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `tpm_seal` function in `security/keys/trusted-keys/trusted_tpm1.c` had two error return paths that did not free the allocated `td` object, leading to a memory leak. This happened when `tpm_get_random` failed (returning a negative value) or did not return the expected number of bytes (`TPM_NONCE_SIZE`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Leak:**  The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. The `td` object was allocated but not deallocated on certain error paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeated calls to the vulnerable function could lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing denial of service or system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the trusted keys subsystem. An attacker who can trigger the affected code paths, particularly those related to sealing operations with a TPM chip, could cause a memory leak by inducing an error within tpm_get_random.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would likely require access to a user space application or system process that can invoke the trusted key functions and interact with a TPM.

**Technical details:**
- The fix involves adding a `goto out;` statement after checking the return value of `tpm_get_random` and changing the subsequent `return -EIO;` to also `goto out;`. The `out:` label is positioned such that it will deallocate the allocated memory, which prevents the memory leak.
