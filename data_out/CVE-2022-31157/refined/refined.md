- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The function used to generate random nonces was not sufficiently cryptographically complex.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure nonce generation, leading to potential authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass authentication by capturing and replaying nonces.
- **Attack vectors:** Capture-replay attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and replay network traffic containing the insecure nonces.
