Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26579:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Deserialization of Untrusted Data. The vulnerability occurs due to the insecure handling of deserialization of data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application is vulnerable to deserialization attacks. It doesn't properly validate or sanitize input data before deserialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass security measures by injecting malicious parameters through the vulnerable deserialization process.
- This can potentially lead to remote code execution, data corruption, or other malicious actions, depending on the libraries used during deserialization.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Attackers inject malicious parameters through a vulnerable deserialization process, which is typically an entry point for the application receiving data, such as an API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send crafted data to the vulnerable Apache Inlong instance, including the malicious parameters.
- They don't seem to require any prior authentication to perform the exploit.

**Additional details:**
- The affected versions range from 1.7.0 through 1.11.0 of Apache Inlong.
- The fix is provided in version 1.12.0, or by cherry-picking specific commits ([1] and [2] in the references).
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data).
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as high.
