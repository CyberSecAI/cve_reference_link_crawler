# License of libtasn1.map

Hello,

Currently, `libtasn1.map` is used to build the library , but this file is under GPL-3+. Even if it can be considered part of the buildsystem, map files can also be considered in the grey area. Would it be possible to relicensing this file under LGPL-2.1+ like the library to make it clear there is no license issue with it?

Thanks for considering.

Best,
Dylan
