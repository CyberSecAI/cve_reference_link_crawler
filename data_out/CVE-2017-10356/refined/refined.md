  "CVE-2017-10356": {
    "description": "The OpenJDK component in Oracle Java SE and IBM Java SE is vulnerable to weak protection of key stores against brute forcing. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by attempting to guess the password used to protect private keys if an attacker can gain access to a key store.",
    "root_cause": "The Security component of OpenJDK generated weak password-based encryption keys used to protect private keys stored in key stores.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Weak password-based encryption keys"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can attempt to guess the password used to protect private keys in key stores, potentially leading to the disclosure of those keys.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Access to key store required",
      "Password guessing"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs access to the Java key store to attempt brute force password guessing.",
