Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `handler_post_title` function within the "Sight – Professional Image Gallery and Portfolio" WordPress plugin. This function is used to retrieve and display post titles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check to verify if the user is authorized to view the requested post titles. Specifically, the plugin fails to check if the user has the `read_post` capability before displaying the title.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  Because of the missing authorization, the plugin exposes sensitive information such as titles of private, pending, trashed, and draft posts, which are not meant to be publicly accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to post titles that they should not have access to. This might reveal sensitive information about upcoming content, unpublished drafts, or other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Specific Function:** The attack targets the `handler_post_title` function specifically.
* **Dependency on Elementor:** The exploit requires that the Elementor plugin is installed and active on the target WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any user account on the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target WordPress site.
*   **Elementor Plugin:** The attacker needs the Elementor plugin to be installed and active on the target site for the vulnerable code to be reachable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Sight – Professional Image Gallery and Portfolio" plugin up to and including 1.1.2.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.3 of the plugin.
*   The fix in version 1.1.3 includes the addition of a capability check to ensure only authorized users can view post titles.
*   The provided changeset shows that a `current_user_can( 'read_post', $post_id )` check was added to `elementor/helper.php`.
