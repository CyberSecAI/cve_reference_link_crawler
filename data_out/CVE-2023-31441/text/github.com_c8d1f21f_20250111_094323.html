| **Describe the bug** A potential concurrent bug on the crafted JSON file to sanitizeJson and cause an exception. This is related to the U+FFFD Unicode replacement character. **To Reproduce**  ```   @Test   public void testsanitizer() throws Exception {     String input = "\u0010{'\u0000\u0000'\"\u0000\"{.\ufffd-0X29295909049550970,\n\n0";     String want = "{\"\\u0000\\u0000\":\"\\u0000\",\"\":{\"0\":-47455995597866469744,\n\n\"0\":null}}";     String got = Utils.sanitizeJson(input);     assertEquals(want, got);   }  ```  **Screenshots** If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

| [@NEUZhangy](https://github.com/NEUZhangy) Since this happens with the `next` on [an iterator returned by Jackson Databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/jackson-databind-2.15.2/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/node/ObjectNode.java#L282), I would assume the bug lies there, or in the sanitized JSON returned from the [JsonSanitizer](https://github.com/OWASP/json-sanitizer). |

Thanks for the reply. When I double-checked the code, I think the root cause is here:   1. When using the test case I mentioned above, in the first loop, it will run to here:     [anet/src/main/java/mil/dds/anet/utils/Utils.java](https://github.com/NCI-Agency/anet/blob/2657f9092936f4bad81700e5499bb1f590bf7302/src/main/java/mil/dds/anet/utils/Utils.java#L250)  Line 250    in    [2657f90](/NCI-Agency/anet/commit/2657f9092936f4bad81700e5499bb1f590bf7302)         |  | objectNode.remove(entry.getKey()); |    | --- | --- |                that remove an entry from the object node; 2. then, since the for-loop is still using the old reference, it will loop to the entry that code just removed, which is a null reference;     [anet/src/main/java/mil/dds/anet/utils/Utils.java](https://github.com/NCI-Agency/anet/blob/2657f9092936f4bad81700e5499bb1f590bf7302/src/main/java/mil/dds/anet/utils/Utils.java#L244)  Line 244    in    [2657f90](/NCI-Agency/anet/commit/2657f9092936f4bad81700e5499bb1f590bf7302)         |  | final Map.Entry<String, JsonNode> entry = entryIter.next(); |    | --- | --- |                    that is causing the referenced bug. |
