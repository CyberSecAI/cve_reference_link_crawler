- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer within the handling of the Phone Book Access profile in BlueZ.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: A network-adjacent attacker must connect to a malicious Bluetooth device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in network proximity to establish a connection and the user of the target system needs to connect to the malicious device (user interaction).
