Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a hard-coded password for the telnet service found within the `/web_cste/cgi-bin/product.ini` file of the TOTOLINK A3600R router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hard-coded password:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a static, easily discoverable password ("cs2012") for the telnet service directly in the firmware's configuration file.
- **Exposed Credentials:** The file `product.ini` also contains the default login password "admin" for the device's web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can use the hard-coded telnet password to gain unauthorized access to the router's command-line interface.
- **Full Control:**  Telnet access can grant an attacker full control over the device, allowing them to modify settings, execute commands, and potentially compromise the network.
- **Data Exposure:** Access to the router could allow an attacker to view or exfiltrate sensitive information.
- **Device Manipulation:**  An attacker could potentially brick the device or use it as a bot in a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or have some form of network access to the device.
- **Telnet Port:** The attack is carried out through the telnet service, which would typically be on port 23.
- **Password Reuse:** Attackers may attempt to use the discovered telnet password on other Totolink devices if it is reused across multiple models or firmware versions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the hardcoded password.
- **Telnet Client:** The attacker needs telnet client or a similar tool.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Version:** TOTOLINK A3600R V4.1.2cu.5182_B20201102
- **File Location:** `/web_cste/cgi-bin/product.ini`
- **Leaked Credentials:** Telnet password `cs2012`, web login password `admin`
