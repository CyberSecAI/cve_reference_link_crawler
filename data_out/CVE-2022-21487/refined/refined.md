    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of the host system, likely through guest-to-host escape, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over the host operating system.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local attack vector, potentially requiring a malicious guest operating system or an attacker with access to a running VirtualBox guest.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious guest operating system or the ability to execute code within a VirtualBox guest. Low privileges in guest OS are enough to trigger the vulnerability.",
