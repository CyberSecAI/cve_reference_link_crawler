[@zdohnal](https://github.com/zdohnal)

only a question out of curiosity:

I did not yet try out how things behave with the patch

but from plain looking what the patch changes

I think it does not actually improve that cups-browsed

blindly trusts any incoming packet from any host at UDP port 631

but instead it disables by default listening on UDP port 631.

Do I understand it right?

If yes, then I think it avoids the CVE only when cups-browsed

is run with the new default setting which may not happen

after a RPM package update with a new /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf

when the user had changed his existing /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf

perhaps because of things like certain RPM config file handling?

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) You are correct, the current "fix" just disables CUPS browsing by default. Till still needs to rip out the LDAP and CUPS browsing code and do a new release of that...

Sorry, something went wrong.
