- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Brocade SANnav software uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm in internal SSH ports.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Usage of the SHA-1 hash algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access of the system using known weaknesses with the SHA-1 algorithm (although this is unlikely since it's on internal ports not accessible remotely, and the impact is classified as Confidentiality: High, Integrity: None, Availability: None).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A), and the access is gained locally with low privileges (PR:L), meaning an attacker on the same network, with local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable system and have low-level access to the system.
