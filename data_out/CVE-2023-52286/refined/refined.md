Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `install.php` file in tdsqlpcloud contains a function `get_db_info()` that retrieves and outputs database IP, port, and account credentials.
*   This function is accessible through an unauthorized API endpoint, specifically `/index.php/api/install/get_db_info`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The application exposes sensitive database connection information, including IP, port, and credentials.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** The `get_db_info()` function lacks proper authorization checks, making it accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Attackers can obtain database connection information, which can lead to unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Database Compromise:** With gained credentials, attackers could read, modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability via HTTP by directly accessing the unauthorized API endpoint `/index.php/api/install/get_db_info`.
*   The vulnerability is exposed via web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable tdsqlpcloud instance.
*   **Knowledge of the Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific API endpoint `/index.php/api/install/get_db_info` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides a sample URL demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The affected version is specified as tdsqlpcloud v1.8.5.
