| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2054611#c0)  Marian Rehak    2022-02-15 10:34:06 UTC  ``` In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to submit a specially crafted SVG to the ImageMagick to let ImageMagick hang forever from reading a file descriptor. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted SVG file.  Reference:  <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/4626>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2054611#c1)  Marian Rehak    2022-02-15 10:34:30 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 2054612](show_bug.cgi?id=2054612 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-4219 ImageMagick: remote DoS in MagicCore/draw.c via crafted SVG file [epel-8]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2054613](show_bug.cgi?id=2054613 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2021-4219 ImageMagick: remote DoS in MagicCore/draw.c via crafted SVG file [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
