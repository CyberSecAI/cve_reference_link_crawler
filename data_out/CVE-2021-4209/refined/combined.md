### wrap\_nettle\_hash\_fast: avoid calling \_update with zero-length input

```

As Nettle's hash update functions internally call memcpy, providing
zero-length input may cause undefined behavior.

# Null pointer dereference in MD\_UPDATE

## Description of problem:

Using gnutls with guile disabled, null pointer may passed to `memcpy` as argument 2, causing null pointer dereference.

## How to reproduce:

You can easily reproduce this issue:

* Build gnutls with UBSan:

```
CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined -g" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined -g" ./bootstrap
CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined -g" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined -g" ./configure --disable-guile --disable-doc
CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined -g" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined -g"  make
```

* Run server:

```
./gnutls/src/.libs/gnutls-serv -p 7834 -d 9999
```

* Run client:

```
$ UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH="../../lib/.libs:/usr/lib64"  ./gnutls-cli -p 7834 localhost --pskusername psk_identity --pskkey 88f3824b3e5659f52d00e959bacab954b6540344 --priority NORMAL:-KX-ALL:+ECDHE-PSK:+DHE-PSK:+PSK
```

Then the program will crash with the following log:

```
