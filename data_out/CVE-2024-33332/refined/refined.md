- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `/api/blade-system/tenant/list` endpoint. Specifically, the `updatexml` function within a SQL query is being manipulated via URL parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability exists in the SpringBlade application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries and potentially extract sensitive data from the database (in this case, the database user). This could potentially lead to further exploitation including data breaches, privilege escalation or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible through the `/api/blade-system/tenant/list` endpoint via HTTP GET requests, specifically by injecting SQL code through the `updatexml` function in URL parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker also needs to have knowledge of a valid Bearer token to authenticate with the API.
