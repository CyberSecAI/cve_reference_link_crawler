Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling "App objects" within PDF-XChange Editor. This inadequate validation leads to a read operation occurring beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is that the software reads memory beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application doesn't properly validate user-supplied data related to "App objects."

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, effectively gaining control over the user's system.
- **Potential for information disclosure:** While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds reads could potentially expose sensitive information from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker crafts a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted "App object" designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
- **Malicious Web Page:**  An attacker could host a malicious web page that attempts to exploit the vulnerability when a user interacts with it, likely through a PDF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the target machine.
- **User interaction:** The vulnerability requires the victim to either open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious webpage.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Content:**  The attacker must be able to create a PDF file (or host a malicious web page) that contains the specific data necessary to trigger the vulnerability.
