Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-28102

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper limits on the size of compressed data when processing JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens. Specifically, the `jwcrypto` library does not restrict the amount of data it decompresses when handling JWE tokens with DEFLATE compression, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The library is vulnerable to a "JWT bomb" attack, where a malicious actor can craft a JWE token with a high compression ratio. When the server attempts to decompress this data, it consumes excessive memory and processing time.
- **Missing Size Limits:** Prior to version 1.5.6, there was no limit on the size of compressed data that the `jwcrypto` library would attempt to decompress.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a DoS condition where the application becomes unresponsive due to excessive resource usage (CPU and memory).
- **Service Downtime:** The excessive resource usage can cause service interruptions and potential downtime.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JWE Token:** The attack vector is a specially crafted JWE token with a high compression ratio. This token is sent to a server that uses the vulnerable version of `jwcrypto` to deserialize and decrypt JWE tokens.
- **Network:** The attacker can send this malicious JWE token over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send JWE tokens to a system using the vulnerable version of `jwcrypto`.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges, other than the ability to submit data to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a limit on the maximum size of compressed data that will be decompressed.
- Version 1.5.6 of `jwcrypto` includes a fix that limits the maximum compressed size to 256 KB, preventing the vulnerability.
- The `deserialize` function of the JWE class was the vulnerable code.
- The fix implements a `default_max_compressed_size` variable that limits the size of the decompressed data.
- The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how a compressed token can lead to significantly longer processing times compared to an uncompressed token.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to jwcrypto version 1.5.6 or later.
- Limit the maximum token length to 250K (or use the default limit 256k in version 1.5.6) as a similar approach is used in Microsoft Azure's JWT library System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt .

**CVSS Score:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 6.8 (Moderate).
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
