- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper privilege management in Zyxel Access Points (APs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An authenticated user can escalate privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with authenticated access can escalate their privileges and download configuration files from the vulnerable device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface or management interface of the access point by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the vulnerable access point.
