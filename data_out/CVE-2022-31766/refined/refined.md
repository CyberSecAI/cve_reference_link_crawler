- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices, when the TCP Event service is enabled, do not properly handle malformed packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) when processing network packets on the TCP Event service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition, leading to a device reboot and potentially impacting other network resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malformed packets to the TCP Event service port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to the affected devices. The TCP Event service needs to be enabled (not active by default).
