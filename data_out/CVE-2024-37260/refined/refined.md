**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable website.
