The provided content is related to a vulnerability in an Employee Management System and describes an authentication bypass.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user input in the authentication process, specifically within the login page (`alogin.html`). The application is susceptible to SQL injection or a similar type of attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism.
*   **SQL Injection (likely):** The provided proof of concept suggests an SQL injection vulnerability as the payload `'or 1=1-- -` is a common technique to bypass authentication by manipulating SQL queries used to verify login credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the system without valid credentials.
*   **Data Breach:** Once authenticated, an attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive employee data.
*   **System Compromise:** Full system compromise may be possible depending on the application's functionalities.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, by accessing the login page of the application (`alogin.html`).
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the login page with the malicious payload in the email and password parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Login Page:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the login page (`alogin.html`).
*   **Basic Web Attack Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of common web attack techniques, such as SQL injection.
