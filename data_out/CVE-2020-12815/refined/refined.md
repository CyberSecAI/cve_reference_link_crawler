- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input, specifically script-related HTML tags, in the "Storage Connectors Name Parameter" and IPv4/IPv6 address fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTML Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code, potentially leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote authenticated attacker can inject the malicious HTML tags via the vulnerable fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to the vulnerable system.
