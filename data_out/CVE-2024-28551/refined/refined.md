Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function of the Tenda AC18 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function copies the user-supplied `ssid` parameter into a fixed-size buffer (`dest`) without proper bounds checking. The code uses `strcpy` which doesn't prevent writing beyond the buffer's boundary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the router. The overflow can overwrite return addresses on the stack, allowing an attacker to control the program's execution flow. This could lead to complete control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint. The `ssid` parameter within the POST request is used to deliver the overflow payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. This usually means being on the same network as the router, or having some form of network access (e.g., if remote administration is enabled).

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` with untrusted input. The attacker can send an overly long SSID, exceeding the buffer capacity and allowing for arbitrary code execution, thereby gaining full control of the device.
