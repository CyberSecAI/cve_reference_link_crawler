Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `exportUrl` obtained from environment variables within the `ExportProxyServlet.java` file. Specifically, the code was not verifying that the URL starts with "http://" or "https://", allowing for potentially arbitrary URLs to be used in the export process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure URL Handling:** The `ExportProxyServlet` was using a URL derived from an environment variable without properly validating that the provided URL was indeed a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL. This allows an attacker to inject a different URL than intended.
-   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By controlling the export URL, an attacker could potentially make the server perform requests to internal or external resources that are not meant to be accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially use the server to access internal resources and retrieve sensitive information not intended for public access by making the server issue a request to an internal network resource.
-   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could overload the server by forcing it to make requests to very large files or external servers, potentially causing a denial of service.
-   **Arbitrary File Read (Potentially):** In some cases, if an attacker can control a file path they could potentially use this to read the content of file.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** An attacker who has control over the environment variables of the server where the `drawio` application is running can set the vulnerable environment variable (`supportedServices`) to an arbitrary URL.
-   **HTTP Requests**: An attacker can leverage the `/export` endpoint with modified parameters to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Control over Server Environment:** The attacker needs some form of control to set environment variables used by the application.
-  **Ability to send HTTP Requests**: The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the `/export` endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

-   The commit log explicitly states "Limits export proxy URL" suggesting a fix for this very issue.
-   The code change in `ExportProxyServlet.java` adds a check to ensure the `exportUrl` starts with either "http://" or "https://", mitigating the vulnerability by enforcing only valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs are used.
