{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Vigilant MasterMed application uses a symmetric encryption key to sign authentication tokens. An attacker in possession of this key can forge valid JWTs and impersonate arbitrary users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can issue valid JWTs and impersonate arbitrary users, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control over the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack. An attacker needs to obtain the symmetric encryption key used to sign the authentication tokens.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires knowledge of the symmetric encryption key. The attacker needs high privileges and high level of access."
