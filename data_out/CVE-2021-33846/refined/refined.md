The provided content is related to CVE-2021-33846.

**Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
The Vigilant MasterMed application uses a symmetric encryption key to sign authentication tokens issued to authenticated users.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. The use of a symmetric key allows an attacker who obtains the key to forge valid JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker in possession of the symmetric encryption key can generate valid JWTs and impersonate arbitrary users, gaining access to their privileges within the Vigilant MasterMed application.

**Attack Vectors:**
Network based attack. The attacker needs to obtain the symmetric key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs high privileges and a high level of access within the network to obtain the key. They also must be able to access the network where the Vigilant MasterMed application is running.
