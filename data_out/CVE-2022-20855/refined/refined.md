- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper checks during the restart of certain system processes within the self-healing functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software for Embedded Wireless Controllers on Catalyst Access Points.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient validation during system process restarts allows an attacker to bypass the restricted controller shell.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as *root*, leading to a full compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker access through the command line interface (CLI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires valid credentials for a privilege level 15 user on the wireless controller.
