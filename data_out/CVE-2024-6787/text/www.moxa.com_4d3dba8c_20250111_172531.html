###### SUMMARY

### Multiple Vulnerabilities in MXview One and MXview One Central Manager Series

* Security Advisory ID: MPSA-240735
* Version: V1.1
* Release Date: Sep 21, 2024
* Reference:
  + [CVE-2024-6785 (Moxa)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6785)
  + [CVE-2024-6786 (Moxa)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6786)
  + [CVE-2024-6787 (Moxa)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6787)
  + [ICSA-24-268-05](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-268-05)

The impact of CVE-2024-6785, CVE-2024-6786, and CVE-2024-6787 vulnerabilities is detailed in this advisory. These vulnerabilities lead to various attacks, including the exposure of local credentials and arbitrary file writing to the system via the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The affected products are MXview One and MXview One Central Manager Series.

The identified vulnerability types and potential impacts are listed below:

| Item | Vulnerability Type | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk (\*CVE-2024-6785) | The configuration file stores credentials in cleartext. An attacker with local access rights can read or modify the configuration file, potentially resulting in the service being abused because of sensitive information exposure. |
| 2 | CWE-24: Path Traversal: ‘../filedir’ (\*CVE-2024-6786) | The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft MQTT messages that include relative path traversal sequences, enabling them to read arbitrary files on the system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files and JWT signing secrets. |
| 3 | CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (\*CVE-2024-6787) | This vulnerability occurs when an attacker exploits a race condition between the time a file is checked and the time it is used (TOCTOU). By exploiting this race condition, an attacker can write arbitrary files to the system. This could allow the attacker to execute malicious code and potentially cause file losses. |

Note: An asterisk (\*) in the table above indicates newly assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers.
