... even when ACLs are enabled.  This is a follow-up to the fix
of [CVE-2022-1348](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4c4j-w8hm-rjgv "CVE-2022-1348").  It has no impact on security but makes the state
file locking work again in more cases.

Closes: [#446](https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/pull/446)
