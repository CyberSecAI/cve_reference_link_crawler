This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Lock state file to prevent parallel execution

```
Running multiple instances of logrotate on the same set of log-files
might have undesirable effects.

Add command line option --skip-state-lock to skip locking the state
file, for example if locking is unsupported or prohibited.

Fixes: [#295](https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/issues/295)
Closes: [#297](https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/pull/297)
