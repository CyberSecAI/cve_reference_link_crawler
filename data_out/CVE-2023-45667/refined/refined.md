    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference due to an uninitialized variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",

    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service.",

      "Crafted GIF image file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted GIF image file to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "additional_details": "The issue occurs in the `stbi_load_gif_from_memory` function when the image fails to load. The `z` variable may remain uninitialized, leading to a null pointer dereference when `stbi__vertical_flip_slices` is called if the vertical flip flag is set. The `stbi__vertical_flip_slices` function attempts to access `image` using the uninitialized `z` value in a loop. This only occurs if `stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load` is enabled.",
