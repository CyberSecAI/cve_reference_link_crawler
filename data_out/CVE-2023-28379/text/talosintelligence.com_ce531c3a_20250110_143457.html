# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1738

## Weston Embedded uC-HTTP HTTP Server form boundary memory corruption vulnerability

##### November 14, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-28379

##### SUMMARY

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the HTTP Server form boundary functionality of Weston Embedded uC-HTTP v3.01.01. A specially crafted network packet can lead to code execution. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Weston Embedded uC-HTTP v3.01.01

Weston Embedded Cesium NET 3.07.01

Silicon Labs Gecko Platform 4.3.1.0

##### PRODUCT URLS

uC-HTTP - <https://weston-embedded.com/micrium/overview>
Cesium NET - <https://www.weston-embedded.com/cesium-cs-net>
Gecko Platform - <https://www.silabs.com/developers/gecko-software-development-kit>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.0 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-119 - Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

##### DETAILS

The uC-HTTP server implementation is designed to be used on embedded systems that are running the µC/OS II or µC/OS III RTOS kernels. This HTTP server supports many features including persistent connections, form processing, chunked transfer encoding, HTTP header fields processing, HTTP query string processing and dynamic content.

When parsing the boundary string of an HTTP request, the length of that boundary string is not checked before it is used as an index into a buffer on the heap whose length is 72 bytes. If the value of `len` is greater than or equal to 72 bytes, the NULL termination at `[0]` could result in heap corruption.

```
File: http-s_req.c
1663:                                               p_val++;          /* Remove space before boundary val.                    */
1664:                                               p_val = HTTP_StrGraphSrchFirst(p_val,
1665:                                                                              len);
1666:                                               len   = p_field_end - p_val;
...
1672:                                                                 /* Make sure to create a string.                        */
1673:                                               p_conn->FormBoundaryPtr[len] = ASCII_CHAR_NULL;         /* [0] */

```

Because of the memory layout is implemented by the uC-LIB Memory Library, this one byte overwrite results in an arbitrary allocation controlled by the attacker, which could be used to gain code execution as explained below.

When a heap object is freed using uC-LIB Memory `Mem_DynPoolBlkFree`, the pointer to the next free chunk of memory within that pool is stored in the first 4 bytes of that memory block `[0]`.

```
File: lib_mem.c
2072: void  Mem_DynPoolBlkFree (MEM_DYN_POOL  *p_pool,
2073:                           void          *p_blk,
2074:                           LIB_ERR       *p_err)
2075: {
...
2109:    *((void **)p_blk)   = p_pool->BlkFreePtr;              /* [0] */

```

So, when this NULL byte overwrite occurs and the following heap block has been allocated and freed previously, this will overwrite the least significant byte of the next free pointer address. It is possible for the attacker to influence allocations such that when overwriting the least significant byte, the new pointer address will point to a buffer containing attacker controlled data. When this happens, on the next allocation of the heap pool which contains the corrupted free pointer, that same corrupt pointer will be dereferenced and stored in the pool object as the next free pointer `[1]`. This dereferenced value is attacker-controlled, since the corrupted pointer now points to an attacker controlled buffer as a result of this vulnerability. On the next call to `Mem_DynPoolBlkGet`, the dereferenced attacker controlled value will be the pointer, which is allocated `[0]`. The result of this is that the attacker has the ability to allocate memory at an arbitrary address. The impact of an attacker being able to allocate an arbitrary address is that now the attacker can write data anywhere in the program memory space, which could lead to things like overwriting stack data or a function pointer in order to gain code execution.

```
File: lib_mem.c
1978: void  *Mem_DynPoolBlkGet (MEM_DYN_POOL  *p_pool,
1979:                           LIB_ERR       *p_err)
1980: {
...
2014:         p_blk              = p_pool->BlkFreePtr;          /* [0] */
2015:         p_pool->BlkFreePtr = *((void **)p_blk);           /* [1] */

```

### Mitigation

This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling form and multipart form processing in your application. Disabling this requires changes to the configuration header and the instance configuration file as noted below:

Another mitigation option is to modify the code within uC-HTTP itself by checking that the length used as the index is less than the configured size of the buffer.
