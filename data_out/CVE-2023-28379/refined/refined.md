The provided content is related to CVE-2023-28379.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing length check when parsing the boundary string of an HTTP request. Specifically, the code doesn't verify if the length of the boundary string is within the bounds of a 72-byte buffer before using it as an index. If the length is 72 bytes or more, a null byte will be written outside of the buffer, resulting in heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119)
- Heap-based buffer overflow due to missing bounds check when indexing the buffer `p_conn->FormBoundaryPtr` using the length of the boundary string from an HTTP request

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Heap corruption, leading to arbitrary memory allocation.
- The attacker can control the address of allocated memory, leading to writing attacker-controlled data to arbitrary memory locations, ultimately enabling code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a boundary string with a length of 72 or more bytes.
- The attacker can send a malicious network packet to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable service.
- No special privileges or prior access is needed.
