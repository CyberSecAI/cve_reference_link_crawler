**Overview**

The DCS-930L / DCS-931L / DCS-932L / DCS-933L / DCS-934L / DCS-935L / DCS-936L / DCS-940L / DCS-942L / DCS-960L / (non-US) DCS-5000L, all H/W Revs all hardware revisions have reached their End of Life ("EOL") /End of Service Life ("EOS") Life-Cycle.  These products have been accused of multiple vulnerabilities.

The resources associated with these products have ceased their development and are no longer supported. For US consumers, D-Link Systems, Inc. (D-Link US), recommends retiring these products and replacing them with products that receive firmware updates. For non-US consumers, please contact your regional office for recommendations ([LINK](https://us.dlink.com/en/change-region)).

**Please read information and recommendations****below**.

   - **Details:**

**Public Disclosure Report:** DCS-932L & (non-US) DCS-5000L

**- Exploit 1** :: The use of the basic authentication for the devices command interface allows attack vectors that may compromise the cameras configuration and allow malicious users on the LAN to access the device. The last know firmware for the devices do enable digest-authentication to help mitigate this issue. Please see exploit 2 for digest-authenication vulnerability.

        **- Exploit 2 ::** the use of the digest-authentication for the devices command interface may allow further attack vectors that may compromise the cameras configuration and allow malicious users on the LAN to access the device.

In order to mitigate these issues the device would need to support https. The DCS-932L ended sales in the US on May 1, 2019.  The DCS-932L no longer is supported and development has ceased.  D-Link recommends retiring and replacing these cameras with supported devices.  The DCS-5000L was not sold in the US, and D-Link Corporation has End-of-Life the product, you should contact your regional D-Link support for their suggestions. Please see recommendation below for further details.

**Recommendation for End-of-Support/End-of-Life Products**

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached the End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to technological evolution, market demands, new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product maturing over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached the End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), it usually does not receive further extended support or development.

Typically, D-Link cannot resolve device or firmware issues for these products since all development and customer support have ceased.

D-Link strongly advises against the use of end-of-support products, as their continued use may pose significant risks to the devices connected to them. If US consumers choose to disregard this advice, it is crucial to ensure the device has the most recent firmware, frequently update the device's unique password for web-configuration access, and always enable WIFI encryption with a unique password.

**Regarding the Security Update for Your D-Link Device**

Installing firmware updates is a critical step in addressing security vulnerabilities in your D-Link devices. D-Link strongly urges all users to install the relevant updates and regularly check for further updates. After downloading the firmware update, it is essential to ALWAYS validate its success by comparing the firmware version on your product interface to the firmware update version.

Please note that beta software, beta firmware, or a hot-fix release is still undergoing rigorous testing before its official release. This ensures that the software is of the highest quality and meets our stringent standards. However, it is essential to understand that the user assumes all risk and liability for its use. D-Link does not provide any express or implied warranties regarding the suitability or usability of the beta software, beta firmware, or hot-fix release. D-Link will not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, or consequential loss suffered by any party due to their use of the beta firmware, beta software, or hit-fix release.

NOTE: Our products have different hardware revisions, so please check your device’s hardware revision before downloading the corresponding firmware update. The hardware revision can be found on the product label next to the serial number or on the device's web interface.
