Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-0826:

**1. Verification:**

   - The provided content directly references CVE-2024-0826 and describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Qi Addons For Elementor plugin.
   - The vulnerability details from Wordfence confirm the CVE ID and provide a description consistent with the official CVE definition of XSS.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is the insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Qi Addons For Elementor plugin's widgets.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Malicious Code Execution:** When a user accesses an injected page, the embedded malicious scripts execute within the user's browser, potentially leading to:
     - Data theft
     - Session hijacking
     - Defacement of website content
     - Redirection to malicious websites

**5. Attack Vectors:**
