- Root cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper backend verification on front-end data, specifically the return package parameter used for password reset verification.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Authentication bypass, arbitrary password reset.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can reset the password of any account, including the administrator, potentially leading to full control of the affected system.
- Attack vectors: Modifying the return package parameter (specifically, setting the "code" parameter to 1) in the HTTP response during the password reset process.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP response from the server during the password reset attempt and have access to administrator account and dynamic password.
