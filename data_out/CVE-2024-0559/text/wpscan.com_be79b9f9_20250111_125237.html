## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Enhanced Text Widget < 1.6.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its Widget options before outputting them back in attributes, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

As admin, create/edit an Enhanced Text widget and put the following payload in the Title, URL or "CSS Classes" fields: " onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"
The XSS will be triggered when a user move their mouse over
- the title of the widget on page where the widget is output
- the related field when editing the widget
Other payload, for the URL field to trigger in the frontend: ' onmouseover=alert(/XSS-URL/)// and javascript:alert(/XSS/)
