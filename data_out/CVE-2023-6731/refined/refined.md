Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6731

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks on multiple AJAX functions within the WP Show Posts plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify user capabilities before executing AJAX actions. This allows unauthorized users to trigger these actions.
*   **Information Exposure:** Due to the missing capability checks, authenticated users with low privileges (subscriber access and above) can access sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view arbitrary post metadata, lists of posts, and terms and taxonomies.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited via AJAX requests to the affected functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fix for this vulnerability was implemented by adding capability checks to the AJAX functions.
* The vulnerable plugin version is <= 1.1.5, and the patched version is 1.1.6.
* The issue was publicly disclosed on April 16, 2024.
