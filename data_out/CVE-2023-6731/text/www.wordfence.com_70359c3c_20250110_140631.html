### Description

The WP Show Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to view arbitrary post metadata, list posts, and view terms and taxonomies.
