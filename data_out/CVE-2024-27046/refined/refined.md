{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `kmalloc_array()` function in `nfp_fl_lag_do_work()` can return NULL if physical memory is exhausted. Subsequently dereferencing the potentially NULL `acti_netdevs` pointer leads to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference can lead to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered when the system runs out of physical memory while trying to allocate memory for `acti_netdevs` within the `nfp_fl_lag_do_work()` function. Specifically, the nfp driver's flower module, which handles LAG groups, is affected.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to trigger a scenario where physical memory is exhausted during the allocation of `acti_netdevs`."
  },
    "fixes": [
    "The fix is to add a check to see if `kmalloc_array()` returns NULL. If it does, the delayed work is rescheduled and retried later, preventing the null pointer dereference."
  ],
    "cve": "CVE-2024-27046",
    "additional_notes": "The provided information shows the patch and the code change that fixes the vulnerability."
