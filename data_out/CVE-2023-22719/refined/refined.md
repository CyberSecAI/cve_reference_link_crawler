- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GiveWP plugin is vulnerable to CSV Injection. This occurs when a website or application allows users to download data in a CSV format without properly sanitizing the content. This allows a malicious actor to inject specially crafted formulas into the CSV data. When the file is opened by software like Microsoft Excel, the formulas can be executed by the software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious actor can craft malicious formulas that, when opened in spreadsheet software, can be exploited to execute commands on the victim's computer, potentially leading to access to the victim's PC or other malicious outcomes.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user downloading a CSV file generated by the vulnerable plugin that contains injected malicious formulas.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious formulas into data exported as CSV. The attacker can be unauthenticated, meaning no prior access to the website is needed.
