- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) sequences in HTTP headers. This can lead to HTTP response splitting.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious headers or content into the HTTP response. This can lead to various attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or session hijacking. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on Integrity (I:H) but no impact on Confidentiality (C:N) or Availability (A:N)
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), which means the attacker needs to be on the same network segment to exploit this. The exploit does not require user interaction (UI:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) on the local network to exploit this.
