Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `node-request-retry` library forwarding sensitive headers (specifically "Cookie" and "Authorization") during redirects to external domains. This can lead to an information leak, exposing these credentials to an untrusted third party.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** Sensitive information within the "Cookie" and "Authorization" headers are being forwarded to external, potentially untrusted domains during redirects.
*   **Lack of Proper Sanitization:** The code does not properly sanitize or remove these headers before following redirects, thus exposing them to unintended recipients.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Exposure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to the victim's authentication credentials if they control the redirect target.
*   **Session Hijacking:** If cookies are leaked, attackers could potentially hijack user sessions.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Depending on the context and how the authorization headers are used, successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Redirect Manipulation:** An attacker could set up a malicious server and manipulate the redirect URL to point to it. The vulnerable application would then forward the sensitive headers to the attacker's server during the redirect.
*   **URL Query Parameter Injection:** The code identifies external links by checking for a different protocol, host or port in URL query parameters. An attacker can insert a malicious URL in query parameters, causing a redirect with the sensitive headers, as the code does not sanitize them first.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control Redirect URL:** The attacker must be able to influence the redirect URL. This could be through various attack vectors, such as injecting a malicious URL in a query parameter or controlling a URL the application is redirecting to.
*   **Ability to Receive Network Traffic:** The attacker must have a server or endpoint to receive the leaked headers from the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
The fix implemented in commit `0979c6001d9d57c2aac3157c11b007397158922a` adds a `sanitizeHeaders` function which removes `cookie` and `authorization` headers when the request is redirected to a different domain. This commit also fixes issue #137.
