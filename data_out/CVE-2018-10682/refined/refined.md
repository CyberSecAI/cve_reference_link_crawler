{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a combination of misconfiguration and default settings in WildFly. Specifically, if no security realm is defined for the management interfaces (HTTP or native), the server allows unauthenticated access via an 'anonymous' user. This anonymous user has excessive privileges, including the ability to deploy applications. The default auto-deployment feature allows for deploying a malicious .war file leading to remote code execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated access due to missing security realm configuration",
    "Excessive privileges granted to the anonymous user",
    "Default auto-deployment feature enabled for untrusted users"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the WildFly server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the WildFly management console (typically TCP port 9990).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WildFly server and the ability to craft a malicious .war file."
