Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-52817

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check for a NULL pointer (`adev->smc_rreg`) in the `amdgpu_debugfs_regs_smc_read` function within the AMDGPU kernel driver. Similarly, a missing NULL check exists for `adev->smc_wreg` in the `amdgpu_debugfs_regs_smc_write` function. When the `smc_rreg` or `smc_wreg` pointer is NULL, dereferencing them leads to a null pointer dereference. This can occur on certain AMD chips, like VEGA20, when attempting to read or write the `amdgpu_regs_smc` debugfs file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference, which occurs when the kernel attempts to access memory at address `0x0` via the `smc_rreg` or `smc_wreg` pointer when they are NULL. This happens within the `amdgpu_debugfs_regs_smc_read` and `amdgpu_debugfs_regs_smc_write` functions.
-   **Missing Input Validation:** The functions do not validate the `smc_rreg` and `smc_wreg` pointers before using them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Kernel Crash:** The direct impact is a kernel crash (kernel panic) due to a null pointer dereference, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This crash can be triggered by a regular user by reading the corresponding debug file, making the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **File System Interaction:** An attacker triggers the vulnerability by reading the `amdgpu_regs_smc` file located in the debugfs directory (`/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/`).
- **File System Interaction:** Similarly an attacker can trigger the write vulnerability by writing to the `amdgpu_regs_smc` debugfs file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to be able to navigate to the debugfs directory and read or write the file. This does not require root privileges to trigger the crash.

**Technical Details:**
-   **Affected Functions:** `amdgpu_debugfs_regs_smc_read` and `amdgpu_debugfs_regs_smc_write` in `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_debugfs.c`
-   **Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `smc_rreg` or `smc_wreg` pointer is NULL which can happen on certain types of AMD chips.
-   **Reproduction Steps:**
    1. Navigate to `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0`
    2. Execute `cat amdgpu_regs_smc` or write to the file
-   **Exception:** The exception log in the provided text shows a clear NULL pointer dereference, with the RIP (Instruction Pointer) at `0x0`.

**Fix:**
The fix implemented by the commits is to add a check to ensure that the `adev->smc_rreg` and `adev->smc_wreg` pointers are not NULL before dereferencing them. If these pointers are null, the read or write function returns `-EPERM`.

In summary, this is a local privilege escalation vulnerability leading to a denial of service by a non-privileged user by reading/writing the `amdgpu_regs_smc` debugfs file if the `smc_rreg` or `smc_wreg` pointers are NULL, which is fixed by ensuring that the function checks the validity of these pointers before dereferencing them.
