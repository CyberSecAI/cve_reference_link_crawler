- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of file downloads, allowing a user to specify the target filename. This leads to arbitrary file overwriting in the installation directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22), allowing a user to overwrite files in restricted locations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with the required privileges can overwrite arbitrary files, potentially leading to tampering, denial of service, or remote code execution depending on the overwritten file.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, requiring a privileged user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A privileged user is required to exploit this vulnerability, leveraging the file download functionality.
