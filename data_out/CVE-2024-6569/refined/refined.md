Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6569

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin not properly restricting direct access to the `/forms/views/admin/create.php` file. Additionally, `display_errors` was enabled, which resulted in the full path of the web application being exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The plugin exposes the server's full file path due to misconfiguration and lack of access control on `create.php`.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The `create.php` file could be accessed directly without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve the full server path of the web application. While this information is not immediately damaging on its own, it can be used to aid in further attacks by providing internal path details.
*  **Aiding other attacks**: The path disclosure by itself is not critical, but the information gained could help an attacker in other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct File Access:** The attacker directly accesses the `/forms/views/admin/create.php` file via a web request.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:**  The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.8.15.
*   The issue was fixed in version 2.8.16 by adding a security check to the affected files.
*   The vulnerability was reported by stealthcopter.
*  The fix included adding `include_once '../../../security-check.php';` to the vulnerable files.
