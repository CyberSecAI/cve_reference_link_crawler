{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to use eBPF tracing programs within a container to manipulate processes outside of the container by writing to their memory and opened files. This is achieved through the `bpf_probe_write_user` helper.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure use of eBPF within containers.",
        "Lack of proper isolation between containerized and host processes.",
        "Insufficient restrictions on eBPF capabilities within containers.",
          "Overly permissive container configurations (e.g., `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN`, `--privileged`, or `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`)"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can escape the container, gain control of the host system, execute arbitrary commands on the host, potentially impacting other container instances on the same host, and perform actions such as data theft or denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Executing a malicious eBPF program within a compromised container.",
        "Using eBPF tracing to target privileged processes on the host.",
        "Injecting malicious commands into host processes via memory manipulation."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to execute code within a container that has eBPF enabled, typically requiring  `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or running the container with the `--privileged` flag or with access to the docker socket (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`)."
    },
        {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on eBPF capabilities in containers, allowing a container with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` to use eBPF tracing to manipulate host processes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of proper eBPF isolation within containers",
        "Overly permissive container configurations that allow eBPF",
          "Insufficient enforcement of seccomp policies"
      ],
       "impact": "Attackers can escape the container, gain control of the host system by hijacking host processes (like Cron), leading to arbitrary command execution on the host and potential compromise of other containers on the same host. This includes, but is not limited to, data theft and DoS.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Exploiting eBPF's tracing capabilities to write into memory of host processes",
          "Injecting malicious code into host processes through manipulated memory",
        "Running malicious eBPF program within the container."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to execute code within a container that has been given `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or equivalent privileges."
