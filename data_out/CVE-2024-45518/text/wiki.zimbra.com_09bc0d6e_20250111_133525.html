# What's New

## Modern Web App

**General**

* An option to turn off the deletion of appointments for declined meetings has been implemented. Users can now retain appointments in their calendars even if they decline the meeting.
* A PostCSS line return parsing error has been fixed, improving the stability and reliability of the stylesheet processing in the Modern UI.
* Implementation of truncated folder names in the Modern UI has been completed. Folder names that are too long will now be truncated appropriately to fit the interface.

**Mail**

* The tap-to-read or select functionality in the mobile mail list has been reconfigured to allow larger tap area. This update improves the user experience by making it easier to interact with emails on mobile devices.
* The formatting of footer and signature elements in mobile views has been adjusted for better readability and presentation.
* The folder list is no longer shown when composing emails in the Modern UI, reducing cognitive load for user when composing the email and reducing visual clutter.

# Fixed Issues

## Modern Web App

**General**

* The issue where the "sender address is suspicious" warning was incorrectly triggered due to case differences in the email address has been resolved. The check for suspicious email addresses is now case-insensitive, in compliance with RFC standards
* An issue where extra body content was being added in the Modern UI mail body under certain conditions has been corrected.
* An issue in the Modern UI where moving emails in "Conversation view" caused unexpected behavior has been fixed.
* The issue where email body/text alignment in the Modern UI web app was incorrect has been resolved.
* Scrolling issues within the Modern UI have been addressed. Users should now experience smooth and consistent scrolling behavior across all supported apps including Zimbra desktop.
* The problem where S/MIME signing did not work in the Modern UI has been addressed. S/MIME signing functionality is now fully operational.
* An issue where editing the attendees or the body of a new event would not save the changes correctly has been fixed. All edits are now properly saved.
* The issue where meeting invitation emails incorrectly displayed a conflict banner for meetings has been resolved. The conflict banner now only shows when there is an actual scheduling conflict.
* The issue where there was no save button after searching and editing a contact has been resolved.
* In the Modern UI, an issue where Zimbra incorrectly showed all folder types in the folder tree has been fixed.
* An issue where multi-day all-day appointments were truncated to a single day has been fixed. Multi-day all-day events now display correctly across all intended dates.

**Mail**

* An issue where wide elements in emails were not displayed correctly when reading on mobile has been addressed. Emails now render properly on mobile devices regardless of content width.
* The "Edit as new" option was previously unavailable when no predefined signature was set. This issue has been resolved, and the option is now accessible regardless of signature settings.

**Calendar**

* The issue where the "Today" button on the calendar print dialog was not working has been fixed. The button now correctly navigates to today's date in the print preview.
* An issue in the Modern UI where the "New Event" body did not wrap text properly has been resolved. Additionally, the button alignment has been corrected to ensure proper layout.
* The issue where an error was thrown upon clicking the "Show Availability" button in the calendar has been resolved. Users can now view availability without encountering errors.

# Known Issues

## Modern Web App

**Mail**

* When replying to or forwarding an email in plain text with attachments, an error message stating "Failed to Process this request" may appear when the draft is auto-saved. This issue occurs after switching the email format from HTML to plain text, especially when the email contains an image in the signature.
* When viewing a message if there are any distribution lists to which the mail is sent to then the distribution list are displayed twice.
* "Edit as New," "New Event," and "Print" functionalities do not work when the preview pane is disabled in the Zimbra Modern UI. As a workaround, please enable the preview pane to use these features.
