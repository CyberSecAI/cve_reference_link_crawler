The following versions of PowerPanel business, a business management software, are affected:

* PowerPanel business: 4.9.0 and prior

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)

The application code contains a hard-coded set of authentication credentials. This could result in an attacker bypassing authentication and gaining administrator privileges.

[CVE-2024-34025](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-34025) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### **3.2.2** [**USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)

The application code contains a hard-coded JWT signing key. This could result in an attacker forging JWT tokens to bypass authentication.

[CVE-2024-33625](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-33625) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### **3.2.3** [**RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)

A specially crafted Zip file containing path traversal characters can be imported to the server, which allows file writing to the server outside the intended scope, and could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution.

[CVE-2024-33615](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-33615) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### **3.2.4** [**USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)

Hard-coded credentials are used by the platform to authenticate to the database, other services, and the cloud. This could result in an attacker gaining access to services with the privileges of a Powerpanel business application.

[CVE-2024-32053](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-32053) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### **3.2.5** [**ACTIVE DEBUG CODE CWE-489**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html)

Hard-coded credentials for the test server can be found in the production code. This might result in an attacker gaining access to the testing or production server.

[CVE-2024-32047](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-32047) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### **3.2.6** [**STORING PASSWORDS IN A RECOVERABLE FORMAT CWE-257**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/257.html)

[CVE-2024-32042](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-32042) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

#### **3.2.7** [**IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

An attacker with certain MQTT permissions can create malicious messages to all Power Panel devices. This could result in an attacker injecting SQL syntax, writing arbitrary files to the system, and executing remote code.

[CVE-2024-31856](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-31856) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Amir Preminger and Noam Moshe of Claroty Team82 Research reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

CyberPower has released a new version of PowerPanel business that fixes these vulnerabilities:

PowerPanel business: Update to [v4.10.1 or later version](https://www.cyberpower.com/global/en/product/sku/powerpanel_business_for_windows#downloads)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.
