The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1533.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect boundary checks in the inflections parser within the `libmobi` library. This leads to a stack buffer over-read when processing corrupt input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Over-read:** The primary weakness is a buffer over-read vulnerability in the `mobi_decode_infl` function. Incorrect bounds checking allows the parser to read beyond allocated memory when handling specially crafted or corrupt input.
- **Incorrect Boundary Checks:** The core issue is with how the code calculates and validates buffer positions during the parsing process. Specifically, when handling `i` or `d` modifiers, the code manipulates `pos` and `l` variables without proper checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control over the affected system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not explicitly stated, buffer over-reads can cause program crashes, leading to denial of service.
- **Data Corruption:**  The over-read could potentially lead to data corruption, although this is not explicitly emphasized.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Processing Malicious Input:** The attack vector involves supplying the vulnerable `libmobi` library with specially crafted, corrupt input (likely a malformed MOBI file).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to supply the malicious input to a program that uses the vulnerable library to process MOBI files.
- **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability has a low privilege requirement, meaning an attacker does not need elevated permissions to exploit it.
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is considered local, suggesting the attacker would need some level of access to the system.
