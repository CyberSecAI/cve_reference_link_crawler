- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the anti-tamper protection of WatchGuard EPDR and Panda AD360, where crafted commands sent via Inter-Process Communication (IPC) can bypass this protection mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation or sanitization of commands received through IPC, which allows an attacker to bypass the anti-tamper measures.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass anti-tamper protection, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or disablement of the security software. This could result in the system becoming vulnerable to further attacks, and could lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves local access to the machine where WatchGuard EPDR or Panda AD360 is installed. The attacker leverages IPC to send crafted commands to the protection agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local access to the system. No special privileges are required.
