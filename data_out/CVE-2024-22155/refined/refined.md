- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WooCommerce plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while they are authenticated. This could have varying impacts depending on the specific actions targeted.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), meaning a malicious actor would need to trick an authenticated user into submitting a crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into clicking a link or visiting a malicious webpage containing the forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
