Foot Assembly

Introduction

The foot assembly adopts a new design. The movement of the robot will compress the air in the foot

pad and send the pressure signal through the air pipe to the pressure sensor in the shoulder, so as to

judge the environment the robot is in and adjust the movement of the robot accordingly.

Foot end components include foot end base, bottom curved rubber pad, air needle and other

components.It can increase the friction of the foot, avoid the damage of the foot, and reduce the impact

on mechanical parts.

The foot end components are consumables, and the service life is generally 2-6 months (depending on

the use frequency, duration and working condition).Especially in the rough ground running wear will be

more serious, such as obvious foot pad wear, damage, or found that the robot walking on the ground

significantly increased impact noise, please replace the foot components in time, so as not to damage

the foot, resulting in the robot movement disorder.

Control the Robot (Use the Joystick to Manipulate the Robot)

Stick back to center/center: The Stick of the joystick is in the middle position.

Stick lever amount: The offset of the remote control joystick from the center of the joystick.

Walls, doors and other obstructions can greatly weaken the signal between the robot and the

remote control module. Please be sure to operate the robot in an open space.

Before Reading

When using the control program that comes with Unitree, the operation instructions and robot actions

in this section correspond to each other. When the When users use the own programs in developer

mode: the joystick command is still valid during high-level (application layer) development.

If the

high-level API command and the joystick command are sent to the robot together, the two command

robots will execute, which may lead to the robot. Instability, please be sure to determine whether you

need to use the joystick control according to the robot running status. The joystick command fails during

the underlying development.

This chapter is an introduction to the new player's manipulation of the robot. New players can quickly

learn how to use the joystick to control the robot by reading this section, so that the robot can show

excellent sports performance.

This chapter is also a chapter that old players need to check frequently ， Old players can grasp the

essentials of operating robots by repeatedly checking the contents of the table，And know which actions

are not recommended.

The content of the form is mainly divided into 7 parts:

1.Joystick control method for basic operation in Sport mode.

2.Joystick control method for combined action and special action in Sport mode.

3.Joystick control method for basic action in Sport mode (walking).

4.Joystick control method for combined action and special action in Sport mode(walking).

5.Joystick control method for basic operation in Sport mode(fast-running).

6.Joystick control method for basic action in SLAM mode .

7.Actions not recommended in Sport and SLAM mode.

Parts 1 to 6 are actions that allow the operator to use them, which are sufficient to express the superior

athletic performance of the robot. When using the actions involved in sections 1 through 6, be sure to

follow the instructions in the “Disclaimer and Safe Use Guidelines”section.

Part 7 is an action that is not recommended, it is very likely that the robot will fall and the robot's battery

A1 PRO User Manual

Since the robot does not have a visual perception system at present, and the actual control

personnel have different levels of control proficiency, in order to be reliable and stable, please

use it in an open and flat environment. When operating the robot, be careful to avoid steps

above 5cm, slopes greater than 25°, and obstacles that may cause the robot to fall. When the

robot is walking on a terrain with a certain undulation or slope, the controller should reduce

the walking speed of the robot and carefully control

it so that the robot is tripped by

obstacles.

Foot robots have certain requirements for the ground to walk. Do not use robots on the

ground with insufficient friction, such as ice. Do not use robots on soft ground, such as thicker

sponge/turf

floors. For use on smoother floors, such as glass, tiles, etc., carefully and

compliantly control the robot to exercise, avoid strenuous exercise, and reduce the walking

speed of the robot to prevent the robot's foot from slipping and falling.

Robot Special Case Handling

Unitree uses a streamlined mechanical structure to reduce manufacturing difficulty and improve

machine reliability. Our robots have achieved good levels in terms of structure, dynamic performance,

kinematics and cost. The quadruped robots we develop are reliable and cost-effective. They are very

suitable for the exploration of scientific and field-level applications as a new four-legged mobile

platform, but when the external environment does not meet the requirements of robot operation or

improper use by users, The robot will have some abnormalities. In addition, in the developer mode, the

user will use the program developed by himself on the robot. This has great uncertainties and may

cause damage to the robot. Therefore, in the developer mode, please use the protective frame and

rope attached to the Unitree official.

Robot Black Box

The robot black box is mainly used to record the state information of the robot operation. After the

robot fails,, it can help the maintenance personnel to determine the cause of the machine fault more

quickly, and judge whether the cause of the machine fault belongs to the user's improper operation or

the robot hardware problem according to the black box data. After the robot is turned on, the robot

black box will record the machine's IMU, joint angle, joint speed, force sensor and other robot attitude

data, as well as internal historical data such as customer control commands and robot running time.

Improper user operation causes the machine to malfunction and is not covered by the

warranty. Please use it in strict accordance with the operating instructions.

Robot Abnormal Situation Response

In the case of emergency braking, if the robot does not have a protective frame protection, it

may cause the robot to break. Therefore, in the developer mode, the user must ensure that

the robot protects the robot by the protection frame and the protection rope.

When users use their own programs, there is a lot of uncertainty, the robot may do some

unexpected actions (Uncontrolled to the crowd, rushing to the water, high places Fall, leg

movements, tumbling). May cause damage to the robot.

One robot corresponds to a dedicated emergency brake remote control (the robot and the

emergency brake remote control are bound to each other), and the mixing is invalid.

Please use the emergency brake remote control within 10m from the robot in an environment

How to turn off the robot when the remote control module fails

When the remote control module fails (such as the power of the joystick exhausted), the robot can not

be used to make the robot dog down until it is flat on the ground. You can only use the battery power

button to force the shutdown (note! If you are not ready before the shutdown, it will easily cause the

robot to power down and shoot the ground, causing serious damage to the robot).

Preparations before forced shutdown: After passing the nylon belt through the robot suspension board,

hold the nylon belt by hand to make it in a tight state (as shown in the figure below). Press the power

switch for a short time, and then press and hold the power switch for 2 seconds Turn off the power, and

slowly place the robot on the ground after power off.

electromagnetic interference include, but are not limited to, high voltage power lines, high voltage

power stations, mobile telephone base stations, and television broadcast signal towers.

2.Please do not run the robot in the environment of WiFi signal interference. WiFi signal interference is

usually caused by co-channel interference. When you are disturbed, be sure to turn off some or all

of the other wireless device WiFi sources, and then use the remote control to operate the robot.

3.Operate in a good weather environment at 5 ° C -35 ° C. Do not operate in bad weather, such as fog,

snow, rain, lightning, sandstorms, storms, tornadoes, etc.

4.When using, please keep the robot within the line of sight to keep the robot at a safe distance of at

least 3 meters from obstacles, complex ground, crowds, water surface and other objects.

5.Since the robot does not have a visual perception system at present, and the actual control personnel

have different levels of control proficiency, in order to be reliable and stable, please use it in an open

and flat environment. When operating the robot, be careful to avoid steps above 10cm, slopes

greater than 25°, and obstacles that may cause the robot to fall. When the robot is walking on a

terrain with a certain undulation or slope, the controller should reduce the walking speed of the

robot and carefully control it so that the robot is tripped by obstacles.

6.The robot is not waterproof, please do not run on the ground with water, rain or snow or humid

environment.

7.The robot is not dustproof. Do not run on gravel or dusty environment.

8.Foot robots have certain requirements for the ground to walk. Do not use robots on the ground with

very low friction, such as ice. Do not use robots on soft ground, such as thicker sponge floors and

grassland. For use on smoother floors, such as glass, tiles, etc., carefully and compliantly control the

robot to exercise, avoid strenuous exercise, and reduce the walking speed of the robot to prevent

the robot's foot from slipping and falling.

Check Before Starting

1.Use only genuine Unity parts and ensure that all parts are in good working order.

2.Make sure the remote control and battery pack are fully charged.

3.Make sure the firmware and app have been updated to the latest version (early versions may only

2018 Unitree All Rights Reserved 41

A1 PRO User Manual

support manual firmware updates).

4.Please make sure that the robot is placed on the leveling ground before starting the machine. The

robot's abdominal support pad should be flat on the ground. The body level is not tilted on the

ground. The robot calf is fully stowed and the robot hip joint is adjusted to open the four legs. Refer

to "Body Display" in the "Preparing Before Boot" section.

5.Users ensure that they are not manipulating the robot without drunkenness, drug effects, or inability

to concentrate.

6.Be familiar with the characteristics of each gait mode. Familiar with emergency braking method in

case of robot instability/uncontrolled.

7.Ensure that there are no foreign objects inside the robot and each component (e.g. water, oil, sand,

earth, etc.)

8.Check the condition of the robot cable: whether the cable is damaged, whether the interface is

disconnected, and whether the cable is caught in the gap between the hip motor and the front and

rear baffles. If the cable is caught in the above gap, the cable should be removed. To prevent

damage to the cable.

Operational Considerations

1.Standing Status:

When standing, if the local friction is insufficient or the robot's foot does not have reliable support,

do not violently control the robot for posture adjustment (including pitch, roll, yaw, body height

adjustment, etc.), otherwise the side may cause the robot to lose stability. inverted。

2.Walking Status:

Please walk under the stable terrain control. If you are walking on a ground with less friction, do not

violently control the robot to complete the movement. Otherwise, the side may cause the robot's

foot to slip and become unstable.

3.Battery Life：

The rated life of the robot with no-load static standing and upright running alternately is about 1

-2.5hours. It depends on the actual operating conditions of the robot, such as long-time faster

walking, long-term adjustment of the body posture when the robot is standing, robotic leg bending

standing, running with load, lower body height walking, appropriate Conditions such as undulations

and slope topography will reduce battery life. (The height of the body is low, and when the knee

joint is relatively large, the burden on the motor is large, so the power consumption is significantly

increased early, and the motor is heated).

A1 PRO User Manual

4.About Steps and Undulating Pavement：

Since the robot does not have a visual perception system, and the actual controller has different

levels of proficiency in control, the current version does not recommend the customer to walk more

than 10 cm for the sake of reliability and stability, otherwise it is likely to be caught due to improper

operation. The control personnel should also be cautious when encountering undulating ground

and reduce the speed of the robot.

5.About Climbing：

The rated forward climbing angle is less than or equal to 25°. Since the robot does not have a visual

perception system at present, when using a large climbing angle (about equal to or greater than

25°), the robot body is likely to have a more lateral drift, especially when using the Trot gait; The

visual perception system, which makes a direct turn on a slope with a large slope,

is likely to

destabilize the robot; when climbing the slope, please reduce the walking speed; it needs to be

controlled by the controller.

6.About Speed：

The maximum speed can reach 3.3m/s under the stable control of flat terrain.

7.About the Robot Walking by the Track：

The official delivery version may support the robot on a flat or square track with pre-set conditions.

8.About the Robot Body Posture Adjustment Combined Action

(including pitch, roll, yaw, body height adjustment, etc.)

The official delivery version may support the standing state, level the ground, under the premise of

pre-setting, the robot performs a series of body posture adjustment combined actions according to

certain rules.

9.About Footpad：

The robot footpad is a consumable item, and we will give you an alternate footpad. Especially when

running on rough ground, the wear will be more serious. If the obvious foot pad is found to be

worn or damaged, or the impact noise on the ground is obviously increased when the robot is

walking, please replace the foot pad in time to avoid damage to the foot. Foot sensor (such as force

sensor).

10.It is forbidden to be complicated on the ground, the ground is slippery, there are debris on the

ground, the terrain is undulating (step is higher than 10cm, etc.), the slope is larger (greater than

25°), and the robot is used when there is a sharp object on the ground or the periphery.

11.Carefully grip the joints at the joints, such as the knee joint.
