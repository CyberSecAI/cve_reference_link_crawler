Thus, you can manage all queries from a centralized help desk system.

![Assign Department And Operator](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/support-ticket-assignment-thumb.jpg)

Ticket assignment

Our online support system allows admins to add multiple departments and assign specific support agents (operators) to tickets. Customers can direct tickets to the respective department – technical, sales, etc. – using a simple dropdown menu on the submission form. Admins can assign and reassign agents to tickets from the back end.

![Ticket Reply Tracking](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/tracking-collaboration-thumb.jpg)

Tracking & collaboration

Help desk system administrators can monitor all activities of the designated support staff. They can keep track of the communication process, evaluate ticket ratings, generate detailed reports, and analyze data. Team managers can organize the work process, edit messages, and reply to tickets themselves.

![Canned Messages Functionality](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/canned-messages-thumb.jpg)

Canned messages

The Ticket Support Script allows help desk administrators to add custom predefined messages that can be used by support members in standard situations. This functionality will speed up response and turnaround time and also helps customer support agents to focus on other ticket cases that might require more effort and attention.

![Customer Profiles](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/customer-panel--thumb.jpg)

Customer panel

The online help desk system provides clients with a password-secured panel where they can communicate with your staff, follow ticket progress, and view replies. Upon sign-up, customers can change their profile details and control what information is automatically recorded in the administration system.

![Clients can rate tickets](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/ticket-rating-thumb.jpg)

Rating feature

After receiving a ticket response, clients can rate it using a set of predefined smilies and frownies. This feature will provide customer support agents and managers with useful feedback and can help the team monitor and improve the quality of their services.

![Generate reports](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/reports-menu-thumb.jpg)

Reports feature

Administrators (support managers) can generate automatic reports for selected periods and check the number of tickets received, replies exchanged, the average rating given by customers, etc. There are two breakdown tables displaying all relevant details sorted by agent and department.

![Automatic Email Notifications](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/email-notifications-ts-thumb.jpg)

Email notifications

If you want to build better customer relationships, use the automatic email function of our online support system to notify your clients as soon as their tickets have been replied to. To decrease the response time rate, you can also automate the emails sent to all departments when a new ticket has been submitted through the help desk system.

![Status Auto Update](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/status-auto-update-thumb.jpg)

Status update automation

The ticket status automatically changes when a support member or a client has replied. Along with the automated email messages and notifications, our support ticket system provides your business with an automated online help desk solution to improve customer support, organize support requests, and optimize the workflow.

![Secure User Access](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/secure-login-thumb.jpg)

Secure user login

The advanced user access allows each support staff member to enter the online help desk control panel using their unique login details. Users with operator-level permissions (support agents) have access to all tickets and customer details. Users with administrator-level permissions (support managers, team leaders, etc.) can change the settings, reassign tickets, and add new users.

![Ticket Filtering Help Desk](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/ticket-filtering-thumb.jpg)

Ticket filtering

With our online help desk system, you can search tickets by client, department, last reply, and status. You can reorder tickets and apply one action to multiple tickets. Thus, you're able to easily find the ticket you're looking for or working on, monitor turnaround time (TAT) and message content, and keep track of ticket status.

![Search tickets on frontend](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/search-frontend-thumb.jpg)

Front-end search

Customers that have sent a series of queries to the support team can browse their archive to find a specific ticket using the simple search field on the front end. This feature has been added with version 3.2 to enhance usability.

![File Upload Feature](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/file-upload-thumb.jpg)

File upload

Optimize efficiency and increase the level of understanding between operators and customers by allowing your clients to upload files through the front-end system. You can specify supported file types by adding the respective extensions in the Options menu. Customer support agents can also attach files to their replies.

![Multi-language Ticket System](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/multi-language-support-ticket-thumb.jpg)

Multi-language support

Our support ticket system has a built-in language module that allows you to easily translate or edit titles. There are separate text fields for each language in the admin area. You can customize the country and language names that appear on the front-end and allow clients to switch languages before sending a ticket.

![Support Ticket System Backup](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/backup-ticket-support-thumb.jpg)

Backup module

To prevent any potential loss of important information, we have provided a backup function that will make a copy of your current MySQL database and the files on your server.

Let our clients share their experience with our support ticket system and how the script has improved their online business.

Hi PHPJabbers,

It's not very often these days people let you know when you've done something right, on the contrary, they sure let you know when you've done something wrong.

I would just like to show my appreciation by thanking you guy's for supplying me with a superb script that does exactly what it say's on the box. It looks good and works well.

In addition to this you also backed it up with technical support that got it right first time, after I inadvertently entered some wrong information into the setup file.

Once again, thank you for all your hard work.

Graham Clipson
