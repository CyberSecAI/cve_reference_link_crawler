# Unprivileged users can escalate privileges by constructing requests

Critical

[lazzzis](/lazzzis)
published
GHSA-gj6h-73c5-xw6f
Oct 17, 2024

## Package

Putong OJ

## Affected versions

< 2.1.0-beta.1

## Patched versions

2.1.0-beta.1

## Description

### Impact

Unprivileged users can escalate privileges by constructing requests. This can lead to unauthorized access, enabling users to perform admin-level operations, potentially compromising sensitive data and system integrity.

### Patches

This problem has been fixed in [`v2.1.0.beta.1`](https://github.com/acm309/PutongOJ/releases/tag/v2.1.0-beta.1).

### Workarounds & References

See [specific changes in `211dfe9`](https://github.com/acm309/PutongOJ/commit/211dfe9ebf1c6618ce5396b0338de4f9b580715e#diff-782628b47d666d5d551e040815ca3f80c0704397258718f0e0f31164608ea7beL118-R120), which added relevant authentication checks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
