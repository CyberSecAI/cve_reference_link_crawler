Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-36106:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The TYPO3 CMS password reset mechanism for backend users failed to check if the password reset token had expired before allowing a password reset.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized password resets because the system doesn't properly validate the expiration time of reset tokens.
- **Missing check on expiration time:** The expiration time included in the password reset link was not being evaluated to see if the token was still valid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could use an expired password reset link to gain unauthorized access to a TYPO3 backend user account.
- This could allow the attacker to modify content, potentially inject malicious code, or perform other unauthorized actions within the TYPO3 CMS.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attacker needs to obtain a password reset link for a valid backend user. This can be achieved by initiating a password reset request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a valid, though potentially expired, password reset link for a backend user.
- The attacker must be able to send requests to the TYPO3 instance.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the existence of the vulnerable system and the functionality to request password reset tokens.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is in TYPO3 versions 10.4.32 and 11.5.16.
- The vulnerability affects TYPO3 versions 10.4.0-10.4.31 and 11.0.0-11.5.15.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Medium" severity, with a CVSS score of 5.0. The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C`.
- The issue is related to the `PasswordReset` component of the `backend` extension.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ingo Fabbri and fixed by Torben Hansen.
- The fix adds a check to ensure that the expiration timestamp included in the password reset link is still valid.
- The associated CWE is CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), according to the GitHub advisory, although the typo3.org advisory refers to CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release).
