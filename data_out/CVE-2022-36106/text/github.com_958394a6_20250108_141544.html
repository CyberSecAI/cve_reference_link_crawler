[SECURITY] Respect expiration time of password reset token

```
When a TYPO3 backend user performs a password reset request, a
password reset link including an expiration time is sent to the
user. The expiration time is included in HMAC calculation of
the saved password reset hash, but it is never evaluated if the
expiration time is exceeded.

This change adds the missing validity check for the expiration
time included in the password reset link.
