Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into various parameters.

**Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and sanitization.

**Impact:**
*   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages.
*   This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other unauthorized actions performed in the context of the victim's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript payloads into specific vulnerable parameters through HTTP requests.
*   These payloads are then stored in the application's database.
*   When a user accesses a page displaying this stored data, the malicious JavaScript executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to submit or modify data via the vulnerable parameters.
*   In most cases, this requires the attacker to have an authenticated session with the application.  The provided information states a low-privileged user is sufficient for exploitation.

**Specific Vulnerable Parameters (CVE-2023-43716):**
*   `/admin/configuration/saveparam` - Vulnerable Parameter: `MAX_DISPLAY_NEW_PRODUCTS_TITLE[1]`

**Payload:**

```
"><script>alert(13)</script>.
```

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory lists a large number of CVEs, all relating to the same vulnerability in different parameters within the application.
*   The specific vulnerable parameters are all located in the admin interface, which suggests that successful exploitation would require administrative access or compromised admin credentials.
*   The advisory provides a simple but effective payload, showing a basic `alert(13)` execution, which would confirm the vulnerability is present and can be used to inject arbitrary javascript.
*   The affected product is Os Commerce version 4.12.56860.
*   There is no patch available.
