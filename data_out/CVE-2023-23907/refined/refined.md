- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `start` function in `server.js` of MilesightVPN lacks proper validation on the pathname obtained from the URL. Specifically, the `fs.readFile` function uses `path.join(__dirname, '../' + pathname)` to construct the file path without sanitizing the input `pathname`, allowing directory traversal.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Path Traversal (CWE-22): The application does not properly validate user-supplied input that is used to construct file paths, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended web server's root directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary file read: By crafting a malicious network request with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network request to the vulnerable server's HTTPS port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access: The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable MilesightVPN server.
    - No authentication required: The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
