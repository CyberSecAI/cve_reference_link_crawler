If you have some signed stuff in the wiki with that script service, will it be still be able to verify the signature?      All reactions          This comment has been minimized.

For this the CMSSignedDataVerifier is used instead, which is able to verify signatures based on the different algorithms supported by the crypto API.     üëç 1  surli reacted with thumbs up emoji   All reactions  * üëç   1 reaction         This comment has been minimized.
