# Crypto script service uses hashing algorithm SHA1 with RSA for certificate signature

Moderate

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-h8v5-p258-pqf4
May 5, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-crypto
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<13.10.6;<14.3.1;<14.4-rc-1

## Patched versions

13.10.6;14.3.1;14.4-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

XWiki Crypto API will generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA1 with RSA, which is not considered safe anymore for use in certificate signatures, due to the risk of collisions with SHA1.

Note that this API is never used in XWiki Standard but it might be used in some extensions of XWiki.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki version 13.10.6, 14.3.1 and 14.4-rc-1. Since then, the Crypto API will generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA256 with RSA.

### Workarounds

Administrators are advised to upgrade their XWiki installation to one of the patched versions.

If the upgrade is not possible, it is possible to patch the module xwiki-platform-crypto in a local installation by applying the change exposed in [26728f3](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/26728f3f23658288683667a5182a916c7ecefc52) and re-compiling the module.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

For this the CMSSignedDataVerifier is used instead, which is able to verify signatures based on the different algorithms supported by the crypto API.     👍 1  surli reacted with thumbs up emoji   All reactions  * 👍   1 reaction         This comment has been minimized.

#### Description

[Since September 2021](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/CHANGES.md?plain=1#L938), OpenSSL in version 3.0.0 discards by default certificates signed using SHA1, as techniques have been found to create collisions on SHA1 signatures.

In order to continue using SHA1-signed certificates, end users have to configure their OpenSSL installation to lower its security level, which will also allow other less-securely signed certificates to be validated by OpenSSL ([this issue](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/16650) talks about it).

In XWiki, we use [SHA1 with RSA](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/3b871d906e664fa1875fbeb088404cf31e9f0094/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-crypto/xwiki-platform-crypto-script/src/main/java/org/xwiki/crypto/script/RSACryptoScriptService.java#L89) to sign certificates with the crypto APIs by default, this task is about switching to a more robust hashing algorithm.

Looking at what is done outside, it seems that SHA256-signed certificates have become the norm, and are now used by Let's Encrypt.
