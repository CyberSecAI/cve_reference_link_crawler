Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A path traversal vulnerability existed due to a lack of proper validation of the base directory in the LiveConfig web server component. This allowed access to files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unauthenticated path traversal: The vulnerability could be exploited without requiring any authentication.
- Insufficient input validation: The application failed to properly sanitize or validate the requested file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server with the permissions of the `liveconfig` user.
- Potential access to sensitive data: Depending on the server configuration, this could include customer data (e.g., contact information stored in an SQLite database), domain names, and user names. It's noted that highly sensitive information like passwords and private keys are hashed or encrypted in the database, and passwords are deleted after successful account creation.
- No access to webspace accounts/other user files or the LiveConfig license/TLS certificate.
- If MySQL was used, database credentials were not exposed as the config file is not readable by the `liveconfig` user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `static` endpoint, including path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LiveConfig server.
- No authentication required: The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction required: The attack can be performed without any user interaction.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in LiveConfig versions up to 2.5.1.
- It was fixed in version 2.5.2 by removing the vulnerable `static` component.
- A CVSS v4.0 score of 8.7 (High) was calculated by DriveByte, and 7.7 (High) by LiveConfig which can be found here [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N) and [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N/E:P](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N/E:P) respectively.
- The provided `curl` PoC demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited.
- Logs can be checked for requests containing `/static///////../../../../` to identify exploitation attempts.
