Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10053:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided documents, specifically the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2017:1789 and RHSA-2017:1792, and the NetApp advisory NTAP-20170720-0001, explicitly mention CVE-2017-10053 as a vulnerability addressed in their respective security updates for Java. The description in RHSA-2017:1789 also matches the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   -  The root cause is described as an issue within the `JPEGImageReader` implementation in the 2D component of OpenJDK.
   -  Specifically, it's noted that the `JPEGImageReader` implementation would, in certain cases, read all image data even if it was not used later.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - The vulnerability lies in the inefficient way `JPEGImageReader` handles image data, leading to unnecessary processing.
   - The vulnerability is a result of improper bounds checks or lack of proper resource management when processing image data within the `JPEGImageReader`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - A specially crafted image could cause a Java application to temporarily use an excessive amount of CPU and memory, potentially leading to a temporary denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This is because even if the application didn't need the complete image data it would still be processed.
   - The content indicates that the vulnerability may lead to excessive resource consumption, specifically CPU and memory.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector involves an attacker providing a specially crafted JPEG image to a Java application using the vulnerable `JPEGImageReader`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - An attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious JPEG image to an application using the vulnerable `JPEGImageReader`.
   - No specific privileges are required on the target system.
   - The attacker does not necessarily need to be a local user, as the attack vector is through a malformed JPEG image.

**Additional Notes**
- The Netapp Advisory indicates that multiple products could be affected because they include java libraries that are susceptible to this issue.
- The RedHat advisory states that if the web browser plug-in provided by `icedtea-web` package was installed, the issue exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.

In summary, the CVE-2017-10053 vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Java's `JPEGImageReader` processes image data, leading to potentially excessive resource consumption when handling specially crafted images. Attackers could exploit this by supplying such images to vulnerable Java applications.
