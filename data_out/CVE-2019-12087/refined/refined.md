The provided content is related to CVE-2019-12087.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an unprotected intent in the Samsung ContainerAgent app. This unprotected intent allows an attacker to send commands to the app, leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unprotected intent: The ContainerAgent app exposes an intent that can be triggered without proper authorization or validation. This allows arbitrary commands to be sent to the app.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Temporary bricking of the device: By sending specific commands, the attacker can lock the Secure Folder and cause the device to get stuck in the launcher, effectively rendering the device unusable until the issue is resolved.
- Local Denial of Service (DoS): The user is unable to use their device as intended, impacting their ability to access applications and data.

**Attack vectors:**
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge): The provided commands are executed using ADB via the command line. This requires the attacker to have a connection to the device via USB or network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- ADB access: The attacker needs to have ADB enabled on the target device and be able to send commands to it through an ADB shell. This requires some level of access to the device.
