- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An incorrectly configured XML parser within SAML authentication is vulnerable to entity expansion attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The XML parser does not properly handle XML input containing references to entity expansions. Recursive references to entity expansions can lead to excessive memory consumption. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending specially crafted XML messages. The excessive memory consumption can crash the Splunk daemon or cause it to be terminated by the operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted XML messages to the XML parser within SAML authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted messages to the XML parser used in SAML authentication. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
