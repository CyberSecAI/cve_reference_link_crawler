- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape some of its block attributes before outputting them in a page or post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation and output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a website, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected page or post. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - An attacker with at least contributor access can insert malicious code through crafted block attributes while in Code Editor mode.
  - The injected script is triggered when a user moves the mouse over the text "show less" on the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit posts.
