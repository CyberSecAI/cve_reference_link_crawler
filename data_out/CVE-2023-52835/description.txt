In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Bail out early if the request AUX area is out of bound

When perf-record with a large AUX area, e.g 4GB, it fails with:

    #perf record -C 0 -m ,4G -e arm_spe_0// -- sleep 1
    failed to mmap with 12 (Cannot allocate memory)

and it reveals a WARNING with __alloc_pages():

	------------[ cut here ]------------
	WARNING: CPU: 44 PID: 17573 at mm/page_alloc.c:5568 __alloc_pages+0x1ec/0x248

'rb->aux_pages' allocated by kcalloc() is a pointer array which is used to
maintains AUX trace pages. The allocated page for this array is physically
contiguous (and virtually contiguous) with an order of 0..MAX_ORDER. If the
size of pointer array crosses the limitation set by MAX_ORDER, it reveals a
WARNING.

So bail out early with -ENOMEM if the request AUX area is out of bound,
e.g.:

    #perf record -C 0 -m ,4G -e arm_spe_0// -- sleep 1
    failed to mmap with 12 (Cannot allocate memory)
