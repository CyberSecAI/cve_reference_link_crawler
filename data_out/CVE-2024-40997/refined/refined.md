The provided content relates to a memory leak fix in the Linux kernel's amd-pstate driver, which is addressed by commit `cea04f3d9aeebda9d9c063c0dfa71e739c322c81`. This commit and the related patches are present in the provided git logs.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `cpudata` memory allocated using `kzalloc()` in the `amd_pstate_epp_cpu_init()` function was not being freed in the corresponding exit function, `amd_pstate_epp_cpu_exit()`, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak. The `amd_cpudata` structure was allocated but not freed on CPU exit from the EPP cpufreq policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated CPU exit/entry into the EPP cpufreq policy could lead to gradual memory exhaustion and potentially impact system stability and performance.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the normal operation of the cpufreq subsystem, specifically when a CPU exits from the EPP policy. An attacker would need to influence the system to repeatedly trigger CPU exits from the EPP policy to exhaust memory. However, the system itself handles CPU frequency changes, so this would be difficult to exploit directly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special attacker capabilities are required to trigger the vulnerability. The memory leak occurs naturally during the normal course of CPU frequency management by the kernel. However, exploiting it for denial of service would require influence over the system to trigger CPU frequency changes repeatedly, which is not a typical attack vector.

The patches shown introduce the following code to `amd_pstate_epp_cpu_exit`:
```c
struct amd_cpudata *cpudata = policy->driver_data;

if (cpudata) {
    kfree(cpudata);
    policy->driver_data = NULL;
}
```
This code ensures the allocated memory is freed on exit.
