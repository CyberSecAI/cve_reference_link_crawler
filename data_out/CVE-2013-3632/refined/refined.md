Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from OpenMediaVault's implementation of cron job management. Specifically, it allows authenticated users to create cron jobs as arbitrary users on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Cron Job Creation:** The core issue is that the application allows users to define the user context for cron jobs, enabling them to schedule commands to run as any user on the system, including the root user.
- **Post-Authentication Command Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary commands within the cron job definition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user specified in the cron job definition.
- **Full System Compromise:** By running commands as the root user, an attacker can gain complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** The vulnerability is exploited via the web interface of OpenMediaVault, accessible through HTTP or HTTPS.
- **Authenticated User Required:** The attacker must have valid login credentials to access the application.
- **Cron Job Manipulation:** The attacker leverages the functionality for creating and modifying cron jobs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenMediaVault instance.
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid username and password to login to the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit is post-authentication, meaning that an attacker must have valid login credentials before they can exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is considered a "wontfix" by OpenMediaVault.
- A Metasploit module exists to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user specified in the cron job, with a high risk of full system compromise if commands are run as the root user.
