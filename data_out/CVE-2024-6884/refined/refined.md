- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape block options before outputting them in a page/post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who view the page/post. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to, session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by inserting malicious code into specific fields of a Countdown block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in WordPress. They can then add or modify posts containing the vulnerable block, injecting the malicious code into the relevant fields.
