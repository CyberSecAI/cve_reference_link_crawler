Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3155:

**Verification:**

The provided text includes a mention of `CVE-2018-3155` within the context of MySQL Server vulnerabilities. Specifically, it lists this CVE within a Red Hat security advisory and within the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018 and within NetApp product advisory. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Analysis of CVE-2018-3155 based on the provided text:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the "Server: Parser" component of MySQL Server. This indicates an issue in how the server parses SQL queries.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The weakness is within the SQL parsing logic. The specific type of parsing error or flaw that leads to the vulnerability is not disclosed.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The vulnerability can lead to a "hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server."
    *   The CVE entry in Red Hat's advisory states an impact of "unspecified vulnerability".
    *   Oracle's Risk Matrix states impact as: "None", "None", "High". This indicates a "None" for Confidentiality and Integrity, but "High" for Availability.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the `MySQL Protocol`. This means that exploitation is likely done through sending specially crafted SQL queries or commands to the MySQL server through the network.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to send SQL queries to the server. This typically means having a network connection to the server and potentially some form of authentication, though this is not specifically stated.
    *   Oracle's matrix indicates a CVSS v3.0 score of 7.7 which implies that a low privilege account is sufficient to launch an attack. This is reinforced by the "Low" Privileges Required score.
    * Red Hat's security advisory indicates a *Moderate* vulnerability severity.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-3155 is a vulnerability in the SQL parser of MySQL Server, which can be exploited by sending malicious SQL queries, leading to a Denial of Service. While the exact nature of the parsing error is not provided, the impact is that an attacker can crash the server using a maliciously crafted SQL query, even with a low-privileged account.
