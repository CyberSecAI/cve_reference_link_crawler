Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formQuickIndex` function of the Tenda FH1203 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies within the handling of the `PPPOEPassword` parameter in the `formQuickIndex` function.
-  Insufficient bounds checking on the size of the input provided to the `PPPOEPassword` parameter leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack by providing a large value for the `PPPOEPassword` parameter.
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can result in arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted request to the `formQuickIndex` function, specifically targeting the `PPPOEPassword` parameter.
- This request is likely sent over HTTP or HTTPS, meaning network access to the device is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the Tenda FH1203 device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable parameter `PPPOEPassword` in the `formQuickIndex` function to craft the exploit.
