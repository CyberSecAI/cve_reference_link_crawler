- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the sslvpnd component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Specifically crafted requests to the SSL-VPN service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable SSL-VPN service. No authentication is required.
