### Description

The Simple Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data| due to insufficient authorization checking on the fetch\_quick\_job() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to fetch arbitrary posts, which can be password protected or private and contain sensitive information.
