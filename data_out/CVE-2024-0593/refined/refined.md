Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `fetch_quick_job()` function of the Simple Job Board WordPress plugin. Specifically, the function allowed unauthenticated users to access job posts through an AJAX call, bypassing the normal WordPress permission system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication and authorization checks before retrieving and displaying job post content. The `fetch_quick_job()` function in versions 2.10.8 and below did not check if the user had the necessary permissions to view the requested post.
*   **Information Disclosure:** As a result of the missing authorization check, unauthenticated users could retrieve arbitrary job posts, including those that were password-protected or private.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information contained within job postings that were not intended for public viewing, such as internal company details, salary information, or other confidential data.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The exposure of private or password-protected content could lead to privacy breaches and potential reputational damage for the site owner.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct AJAX Request:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_nopriv_fetch_quick_job` endpoint with a specific `job_id` parameter to retrieve the content of the desired post.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack can be carried out by any user, even without logging into the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No special privileges are needed:** The attacker doesn't need any account on the WordPress site or any specific permissions.
*   **Knowledge of the plugin's AJAX endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL to send the AJAX request to (`wp_ajax_nopriv_fetch_quick_job`) and understand how to use the `job_id` parameter.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional details from the patch:**
The provided patch (changeset 3038476) shows the fix involved adding the following checks:

1.  **User Login Check:** It checks if the user is logged in and has the `manage_options` capability.
2.  **Capability Check**: It verifies if the user has the `read_post` capability for the requested post.
3.  **Post Status and Editing Capability Check:** Checks if post is published or if the user has `edit_post` capability.
4.   The patch includes sanitization of the `job_id` parameter and proper use of WordPress functions `get_post()` and `setup_postdata()` to retrieve the content.
5.   The patch also includes the use of `wp_kses_post` when outputting the content of the post.
