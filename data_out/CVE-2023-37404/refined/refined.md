- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability allows an attacker on the network to execute arbitrary code on the host after a successful DNS poisoning attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary code execution vulnerability due to a successful DNS poisoning attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the host system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a successful DNS poisoning attack that allows a network attacker to gain a foothold.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable system and capable of carrying out a DNS poisoning attack.
