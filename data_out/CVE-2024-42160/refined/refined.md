Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing validation check for fault injection attributes in the `parse_options()` function of the F2FS file system. Specifically, when users specify fault injection parameters via mount options (like `fault_injection` and `fault_type`), these values were not properly validated before being used to configure the fault injection mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `parse_options()` function failed to validate the `rate` and `type` parameters for fault injection, potentially allowing users to provide out-of-range values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integer Overflow:** By providing a large value for the `rate` parameter, it could lead to an integer overflow when converting to the `int` type used internally, as the code did not check `rate > INT_MAX`.
- **Invalid Fault Type:** By providing a large value for the `type` parameter, it could lead to specifying an invalid fault type, resulting in unpredictable behavior or potential crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Mount Options:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing malicious input when mounting an F2FS file system. The attacker would need to specify the `fault_injection` or `fault_type` mount options with an invalid values.
- **Sysfs Interface:** The sysfs interface could also be used to write invalid values to the `FAULT_INFO_TYPE` or `FAULT_INFO_RATE` attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to mount file systems, which typically requires root or privileged user access.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide custom mount options.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves moving the validation of the `rate` and `type` parameters to the `f2fs_build_fault_attr()` function. It now checks if `rate > INT_MAX` and `type >= BIT(FAULT_MAX)`, and returns an error (`-EINVAL`) if the values are invalid. This prevents the integer overflow and invalid fault type issues.
- The `f2fs_build_fault_attr()` function is also used when writing to the sysfs attributes, ensuring validation in this case as well.
- The code was also refactored to use `f2fs_build_fault_attr()` in `__sbi_store()` which simplifies the code by centralizing the fault attribute building process.
- The `inject_rate` type is changed from `unsigned int` to `int` in the `f2fs_fault_info` struct.

This is more detailed than a simple CVE description, which would just state that a missing validation check existed in the F2FS fault injection code.
