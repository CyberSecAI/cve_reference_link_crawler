Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how the NATS server handles authorization when an "accounts" block is defined but only includes the system account ("$SYS"). In this specific scenario, the server unintentionally creates an implicit user in the global account ("$G") and sets it as the `no_auth_user`. This effectively disables authentication, allowing users to connect without providing credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of authentication mechanisms when only the system account is defined in the "accounts" block.
*   **Implicit User Creation:** The server's behavior of creating an implicit user in the global account ("$G") and setting it as the `no_auth_user` is the root cause of the authentication bypass.
*   **Misinterpretation of Configuration:** The server misinterprets the configuration, leading to an insecure state where authentication is disabled when it should be enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can connect to the NATS server without any authentication.
*   **Data Exposure:** Depending on the NATS deployment, unauthorized access could lead to the exposure of sensitive data transmitted via the messaging system.
*   **System Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially manipulate or disrupt the system by publishing or subscribing to NATS messages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the NATS server to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Direct Connection:** The attacker can connect directly to the NATS server using a client without needing valid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable NATS server.
*   **No Credentials Needed:** The vulnerability allows for exploitation without prior access or valid credentials, making it relatively easy for attackers to gain entry.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in NATS server versions 2.2.0 up to and including 2.9.22 and 2.10.1.
*   It was fixed in versions 2.10.2 and 2.9.23.
*   A workaround involves adding a dummy non-system account in the accounts block.
*   The issue was reported by Alex Herrington and discussed publicly before the advisory.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass).
