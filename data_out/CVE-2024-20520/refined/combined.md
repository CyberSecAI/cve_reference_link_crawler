For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has not released and will not release software updates that address these vulnerabilities because the affected products are past their respective dates for End of Software Maintenance Releases. The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) will continue to evaluate and disclose security vulnerabilities that affect these products until they reach their respective Last Dates of Support.  There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers:    + RV160 VPN Routers   + RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV260 VPN Routers   + RV260P VPN Routers with PoE   + RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Routers  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20516, CVE-2024-20517, CVE-2024-20522, CVE-2024-20523, and CVE-2024-20524: Cisco Small Business RV042, RV042G, RV320, and RV325 Denial of Service Vulnerabilities** Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV042, RV042G, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, *Administrator*-level, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.      These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user input that is in incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device, resulting in a DoS condition.      There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.      These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface.

Bug ID(s): [CSCwm48770](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwm48770)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20518, CVE-2024-20519, CVE-2024-20520 and CVE-2024-20521SIR: MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, to reduce the attack surface, administrators may disable remote management and block access to ports 443 and 60443. Affected routers will still be accessible through the LAN interface after the mitigation has been implemented.  For instructions on implementing this mitigation, see the following sections. Disable Remote Management To disable remote management, use the following steps:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall** > **General**.   3. Uncheck the **Remote Management** check box.Block Access to Ports 443 and 60443 To block access to ports 443 and 60443, a new service must first be added to the access rules of the device for port 60443. It is not necessary to add a service for port 443 because it is predefined in the services list. To add a new service to the access rules for port 60443, use the following steps:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall** > **Access Rules**.   3. Click **Service Management**.   4. In the **Service Name** field, enter **TCP-60443**.   5. From the **Protocol** drop-down list, choose **TCP**.   6. In both of the **Port Range** fields, enter **60443**.   7. Click **Add to List**.   8. Click **OK**. Next, access rules must be created to block ports 443 and 60443. To create an access rule to block port 443, use the following steps:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall** > **Access Rules**.   3. Click **Add**.   4. From the **Action** drop-down list, choose **Deny**.   5. From the **Service** drop-down list, choose **HTTPS (TCP 443-443)**.   6. From the **Log** drop-down list, choose **Log packets match this rule**.   7. From the **Source Interface** drop-down list, choose the option that matches the WAN connection on the device.   8. From the **Source IP** drop-down list, choose **Any**.   9. From the **Destination IP** drop-down list, choose **Single**.   10. In both of the **Destination IP** fields, enter the WAN IP address.   11. Click **Save**. To create an access rule to block port 60443, repeat the preceding steps, but for Step 5, choose **HTTPS (TCP 60443-60443)** from the **Service** drop-down list.  **Note:** If a second WAN port is being used, two additional access control list (ACL) rules must be set up using the WAN number and IP address for the second WAN port.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco Small Business RV042, RV042G, RV320, and RV325 Routers are past their respective dates for End of Software Maintenance Releases. For this reason, Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. Customers are advised to refer to the end-of-life notices for these products:  [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV042 and RV042G VPN Router (all models)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-743070.html)[End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-743069.html)  When considering a device migration, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the new products will be sufficient for their network needs, that the new devices contain sufficient memory, and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new product. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
