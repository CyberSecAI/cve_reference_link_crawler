Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `imageLink` property of the `Image` question in the survey library, when the `contentMode` is set to "youtube", does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided URLs. This allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code embedded within the `imageLink` property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code via the `imageLink` property when `contentMode` is "youtube".
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The code does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided for the `imageLink` property when `contentMode` is set to `youtube`, failing to prevent malicious JavaScript from being interpreted as part of the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could steal sensitive user data (e.g., cookies, session tokens).
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions.
- **Page Manipulation:** Malicious scripts can modify the page content or redirect the user to a different website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious `imageLink` Input:** An attacker injects a crafted URL containing JavaScript code into the `imageLink` property of a SurveyJS `Image` question. The `contentMode` needs to be set to `youtube` for the attack to work.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the value of the `imageLink` property for a SurveyJS `Image` question when the content mode is set to `youtube`. This could be achieved in scenarios like:
   - Submitting a survey with a crafted URL.
   -  Modifying the survey configuration.
   - Injections via other vulnerabilities in the application using the survey library.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is explicitly mentioned in the issue title: "Image: The 'imageLink' property allows executing JS code when 'contentMode' is 'youtube'".
- The provided commit `b25fbf0` addresses this issue by modifying the `getCorrectImageLink` function to return an empty string if the provided URL contains javascript code when contentMode is set to youtube, thus preventing the execution of the malicious scripts.
- The commit also introduces new tests to check that the vulnerability is fixed and that javascript is not executed when the content mode is set to youtube.
