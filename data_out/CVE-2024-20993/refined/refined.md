- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in MySQL Server versions up to 8.0.35 and 8.2.0 due to issues within the software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerabilities could allow an attacker with network access to compromise the MySQL Server via multiple protocols.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, specifically causing a hang or repeatable crash of the MySQL Server.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access via multiple protocols.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access. The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker requires high privileges (`PR:H`).
