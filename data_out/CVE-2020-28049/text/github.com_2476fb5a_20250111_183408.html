[0.16.0](/sddm/sddm/releases/tag/v0.16.0)

Full release announcement is [here](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/wiki/0.16.0-Release-Announcement).

## Highlights

### Configuration

SDDM configuration usually consits of user set options and distro defined options.

For example, a distro might want to specify a custom theme, but the

user's autostart name can't come from the distro.

Using the same config file leads to problems when upgrading.

To avoid such problems we introduced configuration directories as well as

the main config file `/etc/sddm.conf`.

Configuration is loaded in the following order:

* All files in `/usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d` in alphabetical order
* All files in `/etc/sddm.conf.d` in alphabetical order
* Finally from `/etc/sddm.conf` for compatibility

Distributions should put their configuration in `/usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d` while

users should write their settings to `/etc/sddm.conf.d`.

### Other changes

* Support non-latin characters in theme settings.
* Support fish shell in Xsession and wayland-session.
* Unlock GNOME keyring at login.
* Configuration directory.
* Make the default cursor themed.
* Update date and time in elarun theme.
* Fix theme metadata default values.
* Fix session selection in elarun.
* Do not truncate XAUTHORITY on login.
* Make enabled property of Button functional.
* Fix typos in documentation.
* Re-use existing sessions.
* Add ConsoleKit 2 support.
* Stop assuming shadow(5) is always available.
* Explicitely set XDG\_SEAT when starting a user session.
* Suppress errors when pam\_elogind is not available.
* Suppress errors when pam\_systemd is not available.
* Added possibility to change color of dropdown menu.
* Add Hindi translation.
* Completed Swedish translation.
* Update French translation.
