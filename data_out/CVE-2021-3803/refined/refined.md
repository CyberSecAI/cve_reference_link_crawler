Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3803:

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-3803 is a vulnerability affecting the `node-nth-check` package, a NodeJS module used for parsing and compiling nth-checks from CSS selectors. The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a vulnerable regular expression used for parsing nth-check formulas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The regular expression used by `node-nth-check` was susceptible to ReDoS attacks. Specifically, a crafted input string could cause the regex engine to take a very long time to process, effectively freezing or crashing the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a specially crafted string to the vulnerable parsing logic, an attacker can cause the application using the `node-nth-check` module to become unresponsive, consuming excessive resources, or crash entirely. This impacts the availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Manipulation:** The attack vector is through crafted input strings supplied to the parsing function of the `node-nth-check` library. Specifically, the `parse` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed to the `node-nth-check` library's parsing function
- No special privileges are needed.

**Additional details:**
- The provided github commit includes the fix for the vulnerability, replacing the vulnerable regex with a hand-rolled parser
- The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 3428-1) confirms the vulnerability and the fix
