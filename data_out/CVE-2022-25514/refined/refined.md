- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow occurs due to a lack of bounds checking when reading data from a font file in the `ttUSHORT()` function within the `stb_truetype.h` library. The library doesn't know the length of the input font file, and thus cannot perform bounds checking, which allows out-of-bounds reads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow, lack of input validation/bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary memory by providing a specially crafted font file. This can lead to information disclosure or potentially other impacts if the read data is used in further processing.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a malicious font file to the `stb_truetype` library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted font file as input to an application using `stb_truetype`.
