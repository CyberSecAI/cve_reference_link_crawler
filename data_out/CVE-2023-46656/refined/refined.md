Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46656:

**CVE-2023-46656**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger Plugin for Jenkins
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.9 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin uses a non-constant time comparison when checking if the provided webhook token matches the expected token.
*   **Weakness:**  Timing attack vulnerability due to the non-constant time comparison.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially use statistical methods to analyze the time it takes for the comparison to complete, and thereby deduce a valid webhook token.
*  **Attack Vector:** Network. By sending multiple requests with varying tokens an attacker can observe time differences and deduce the correct token.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No specific permissions or access to the system are needed to exploit this, only the ability to send web requests to the endpoint protected by the webhook token.

**Summary of CVE-2023-46656:**

The Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger plugin in Jenkins is vulnerable to a timing attack due to its use of non-constant time comparison for webhook tokens. This could allow an attacker to statistically guess the correct token by observing the comparison times. There is no fix available as of the date of the advisory.
