Use CVE-2024-34058.

Additional info:

NethServer is an Open Source operating system for the Linux enthusiast, designed for small offices and medium
enterprises. From their website: "It's simple, secure and flexible" and "ready to deliver your messages, to protect
your network with the built-in firewall, share your files and much more, everything on the same system."

Unauthenticated stored XSS vulnerability due not adequately sanitized input or escaped output for email subject exists
in the provided Groupware, a collaboration suite of services accessible via web through any HTML5 browser, smartphone
or tablet.
It can be leveraged for a nearly zero-click attack.

CVSS score: tbd* (but "High")
CVSS vector: tbd*
CWE: CWE-79

*Needs to be calculated, taking into consideration the initial partial base string "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N" since the
Privileges Required of who send the mail with the payload is none as well as User Interaction (who is receiving the
mail, just visualizing it could trigger the payload - like, for example, to grab session cookie) despite arguable by
someone, Scope and C/I/A (surely from Low to High) must be contextualized from the perspective of the application, what
it is used for, contains/impacts and is connected to it: indeed, being a sensitive component "through a modern user
interface and a single authentication, it allows access to company mail, calendars, contacts, tasks, documents and much
more, in a shared and secure platform" (quoting the product description), that means any kind of highly confidential
information, even connected cloud instance (also outside the private network) and mobile devices synchronization.
