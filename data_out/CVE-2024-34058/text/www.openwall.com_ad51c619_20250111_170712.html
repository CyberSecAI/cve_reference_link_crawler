CVE-2024-34058: Nethserver 7 & 8 stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in WebTop package

> [Suggested description]
> The WebTop package for NethServer 7 and 8 allows stored XSS (for example, via the Subject field if an e-mail message).

From their website: "It's simple, secure and flexible" and "ready to deliver your messages, to protect your network with the built-in firewall, share your files and much more, everything on the same system."

Unauthenticated stored XSS vulnerability due not adequately sanitized input or escaped output for email subject exists in the provided Groupware, a collaboration suite of services accessible via web through any HTML5 browser, smartphone or tablet.
It can be leveraged for a nearly zero-click attack.

CVSS score: tbd* (but "High")
CVSS vector: tbd*
CWE: CWE-79

*Needs to be calculated, taking into consideration the initial partial base string "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N" since the Privileges Required of who send the mail with the payload is none as well as User Interaction (who is receiving the mail, just visualizing it could trigger the payload - like, for example, to grab session cookie) despite arguable by someone, Scope and C/I/A (surely from Low to High) must be contextualized from the perspective of the application, what it is used for, contains/impacts and is connected to it: indeed, being a sensitive component "through a modern user interface and a single authentication, it allows access to company mail, calendars, contacts, tasks, documents and much more, in a shared and secure platform" (quoting the product description), that means any kind of highly confidential information, even connected cloud instance (also outside the private network) and mobile devices synchronization.
