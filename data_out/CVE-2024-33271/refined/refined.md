- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of permissions control in the "Events Manager, Create events & Sell tickets Online" module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A guest user can download personal information without restriction, specifically data from the `ps_customer` table, such as name, surname, and email. This is a violation of GDPR.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized exposure of private personal information to a guest user, potentially leading to identity theft or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, as a guest can remotely access and download the information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges are required, and there is no need for user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs only network access to the affected PrestaShop site.
