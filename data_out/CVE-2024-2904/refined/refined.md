- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Calliope theme for WordPress versions 1.0.33 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The theme lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a logged-in user with higher privileges to perform unintended actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious link or HTML form that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with administrative or other higher privileges to click on the malicious link or submit the crafted form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
