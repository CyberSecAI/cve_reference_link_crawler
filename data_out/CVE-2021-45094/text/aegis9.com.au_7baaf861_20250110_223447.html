Imprivata PAM - CVE-2021-45094

Back in late 2021 I was engaged on a penetration test of a clientâs implementation of the Imprivata Privilege Access Management (PAM), previously known as XTAM (Xton Access Manager ). The goal of the test was to assess the product for security vulnerabilities that may impact the clientâs intended use for managing secrets and secure connections to internal systems by external providers.

Maximising penetration test value for clients: Why threat modelling, proving exploitability and demonstrating impact matters.

Threat modelling and proving exploitability of issues in the context of the threat model is key to gaining maximum value from a penetration test and ensuring that issue criticality levels are not misclassified. This post details how and why correctly applying a threat model can significantly alter the criticality rating of an issue even though the technical risk hasnât changed and how demonstrating exploitability in the threat model context can help inform where resourcing for mitigations could be applied for best effect.
