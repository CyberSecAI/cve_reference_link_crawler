Securing your privileged credentials is critical to keeping your organization safe against a successful attack. [Learn more](https://security.imprivata.com/pam-center-of-security-wp.html) about how PAM helps as an essential part of your security strategy.

While a new security solution has investment costs, the costs of failing to secure privileged access are infinitely higher. [Learn more](https://www.imprivata.com/resources/ebooks/cost-and-roi-cybersecurity) about the relative costs and ROI of cybersecurity solutions like PAM.

Saving time on credential management processes such as provisioning, rotation, and password resets frees up time for more valuable activities. Experience how easy it can be with a [7-day free trial of Imprivata PAM](https://www.imprivata.com/privileged-access-management-trial).

Imprivata Privileged Access Management proves that security can be an enabler. Before we implemented it, it was difficult to grant access to various users to different systems, but now we can log in to Imprivata Privileged Access Management with multi-factor authentication, and we can grant users rights to whatever systems their job function dictates.

Just like the financial industry, the medical industry has a lot of regulation and personal information that they need to keep secure. Imprivata, in my mind, was clearly built to be used not just in a medical facility but used anywhere.
