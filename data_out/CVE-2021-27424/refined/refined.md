Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27424:

**CVE-2021-27424**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the exposure of sensitive information through a MODBUS register that reveals the "last-key pressed." This register is accessible through the MODBUS memory map, which is part of the device's communication guide.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   Exposure of sensitive information. The "last-key pressed" register allows an attacker to potentially obtain sensitive data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by reading the "last-key pressed" register.
*  **Attack Vectors**:
    *   Remote access via Modbus protocol.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to have network access to the device and must be able to communicate using the Modbus protocol. No special privileges are mentioned as required.
*   **CVSS v3 Score**: 5.3
*   **CVSS v3 Vector**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

**Additional Notes:**
*   The affected devices are GE UR family relays (B30, B90, C30, C60, C70, C95, D30, D60, F35, F60, G30, G60, L30, L60, L90, M60, N60, T35, T60).
*   The vulnerability exists in all firmware versions prior to 8.1x with the basic security option enabled.
*   The vulnerability is described in detail in the CISA advisory ICSA-21-075-02, which refers to GE publication GES-2021-004 for more information.
*   Mitigation involves updating the device firmware to version 8.10 or greater.
