FreeBSD-SA-23:13.capsicum Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: copy\_file\_range insufficient capability rights check
Category: core
Module: capsicum
Announced: 2023-10-03
Credits: David Chisnall
Affects: FreeBSD 13.2
Corrected: 2023-10-02 16:00:27 UTC (stable/13, 13.2-STABLE)
2023-10-03 21:24:41 UTC (releng/13.2, 13.2-RELEASE-p4)
CVE Name: CVE-2023-5369
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
Capsicum is a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework. It provides
two kernel primatives, capability mode and capabilities. Capabilities limit
operations that can be performed on file descriptors.
copy\_file\_range is a system call that performs a kernel copy of a byte range
from one file to another or within one file. copy\_file\_range accepts
optional pointers to offsets for the input and output file descriptors.
II. Problem Description
The syscall checked only for the CAP\_READ and CAP\_WRITE capabilities on the
input and output file descriptors, respectively. Using an offset is
logically equivalent to seeking, and the syscall must additionally require
the CAP\_SEEK capability.
III. Impact
A sandboxed process with only read or write but no seek capability on a file
descriptor may be able to read data from or write data to an arbitrary
location within the file corresponding to that file descriptor.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and reboot.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-23:13/capsicum.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-23:13/capsicum.patch.asc
# gpg --verify capsicum.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:
Branch/path Hash Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/13/ 3f0ce63828dc stable/13-n256458
releng/13.2/ 2d23f6c33431 releng/13.2-n254636
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:
# git show --stat
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:
To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:
# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD
