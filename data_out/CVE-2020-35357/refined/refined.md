Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35357

**Root Cause:**
*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `gsl_stats_quantile_from_sorted_data` function of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). This occurs due to improper handling of the quantile fraction input `f`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The function does not properly validate the quantile fraction `f`. It is expected to be within the range of 0 to 1 (inclusive). However, the code does not check this boundary condition, leading to an out-of-bounds read/write.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** When an invalid value of `f` (outside the range [0, 1]) is provided, the calculated index `lhs` can exceed the bounds of the input `sorted_data` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Application Termination:** The immediate effect of this vulnerability is a segmentation fault or unexpected application termination.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** More importantly, this vulnerability could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific application environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious input data (specifically, a value of `f` outside the valid range [0, 1]) for the `gsl_stats_quantile_from_sorted_data` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input data that is processed by the vulnerable function.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to call the `gsl_stats_quantile_from_sorted_data` function with the crafted input.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability occurs in the calculation of `index`, `lhs` and subsequent use of `lhs` to access the `sorted_data` array:

    ```c
        const double index = f * (n - 1) ;
        const size_t lhs = (int)index ;
        const double delta = index - lhs ;
        ...
        result = (1 - delta) * sorted_data[lhs * stride] + delta * sorted_data[(lhs + 1) * stride] ;
    ```
*   When `f` is outside the range [0, 1], `index` calculation will result in out-of-range `lhs`, which will lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Fix:**
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that `f` is within the valid range of 0 to 1. If it is not, the function returns an error (`GSL_EDOM`). Additionally, an assertion has been added to check the same condition.

    ```c
      if ((f < 0.0) || (f > 1.0))
        {
          GSL_ERROR_VAL ("invalid quantile fraction", GSL_EDOM, 0.0);
        }
       assert(0.0 <= f && f <= 1.0);
    ```

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was initially reported in a bug report in the GNU Savannah project.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `989a193268b963aa1047814f7f1402084fb7d859`.
*   Debian LTS provided updates for Debian 10 (buster) and Debian 11 (bullseye) to address this issue.
