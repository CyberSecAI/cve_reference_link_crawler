The Market Exporter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'remove_files' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to use path traversal to delete arbitrary files on the server.
