Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL Injection vulnerability described for CVE-2024-28303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the direct use of user-supplied input within SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the query, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, occurring in multiple parts of the application due to the lack of input sanitization and use of dynamic SQL queries.
- **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered via various parameters in the application such as `date`, `id`, `name`, `brand`, and `lastname`.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The application doesn't use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which would prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-provided data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (usernames, passwords), personal information, and other confidential details.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some instances, SQL Injection can be used to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access and administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET and POST Requests:** The attacks are carried out by manipulating the values of vulnerable parameters within HTTP GET requests (e.g., in URLs) and HTTP POST requests (e.g. form submissions).
- **Direct Parameter Injection:** The malicious SQL code is injected directly into the parameters of the vulnerable endpoints
- **Time Based Detection:** The attacker uses SQL queries with `SLEEP()` function to cause delays and infer if the attack is working.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target web application.
- **Understanding of HTTP and SQL:** A basic understanding of HTTP requests (GET/POST) and SQL syntax is required to craft the malicious payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The most critical issue is that some injection points, such as the one found in `admin/reports/index.php`, are exploitable without prior authentication, amplifying the risk.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations (Examples):**

-   `/admin/reports/index.php` (via the `date` parameter)
-   `/admin/categories/manage_category.php` (via the `id` parameter)
-   `/admin/categories/view_category.php` (via the `id` parameter)
-   `/classes/Master.php` (via the `name` and `brand` parameters)
-   `/classes/Users.php` (via the `lastname` parameter)

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided exploit code (`omos_sqli_exploit.py`) automates the extraction of database names and user data, demonstrating the practical impact of the vulnerability.
- The content provides specific vulnerable code snippets along with payloads, including those for time-based SQL injection detection and data extraction, offering significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.

In summary, the provided content indicates a serious vulnerability in the OMOS application due to widespread SQL injection vulnerabilities which could lead to severe data breaches and system compromise. The provided exploit and payloads highlight the ease with which this vulnerability can be exploited.
