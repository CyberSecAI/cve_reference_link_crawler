## Summary

Common Voice is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Product

Common Voice

## Tested Version

[release-v1.88.2](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/releases/tag/release-v1.88.2)

## Details

### Issue: User-controlled data used in path expression in `fetchLegalDocument` (`GHSL-2023-026`)

Common Voice is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting given that user-controlled data flows to a path expression (path of a network request).

```
// https://github.com/mozilla/common-voice/blob/9d6ffd755e29b81918b86b9f5218b9c27d9c1c1a/server/src/server.ts#L214
private setupPrivacyAndTermsRoutes() {
    this.app.get(
      '/privacy/:locale.html',
      async ({ params: { locale } }, response) => {
        response.send(await fetchLegalDocument('privacy_notice', locale));
      }
    );

```

`setupPrivacyAndTermsRoutes` takes `locale` and passes it to `fetchLegalDocument`.

```
// https://github.com/mozilla/common-voice/blob/9d6ffd755e29b81918b86b9f5218b9c27d9c1c1a/server/src/fetch-legal-document.ts#LL21-L62C2
export default async function fetchLegalDocument(
  name: string,
  locale: string
): Promise<string> {
  ...
  const legalLocale = localeMapping[locale] ?? locale;

  const [status, text] = await request({
    uri: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/legal-docs/master/${legalLocale}/common_voice_${name}.md`,
    resolveWithFullResponse: true,
  })
    .then((response: any) => [response.statusCode, response.body])
    .catch(response => [response.statusCode, null]);

  if (status >= 400 && status < 500) {
    ...
  } else if (status < 300) {
    textHTML = new commonmark.HtmlRenderer().render(
      new commonmark.Parser().parse(
        // There's a parseable datetime string in the legal documents, which we don't need to show
        (text as string).replace(/{:\sdatetime=".*" }/, '')
      )
    );
  }
  ...
  return textHTML;
}

```

`fetchLegalDocument` retrieves a file including the provided `locale` in the path, allowing an attacker to provide `../` to traverse into another repository like `../../../jorgectf-testing/poc/main/poc.html#`.

#### Proof of Concept

```
curl '127.0.0.1:9000/privacy/..%2f..%2f..%2fjorgectf-testing%2fpoc%2fmain%2fpoc.html%23.html'

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the context of Common Voice’s server origin.
