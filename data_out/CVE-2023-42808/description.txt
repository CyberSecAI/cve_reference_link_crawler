Common Voice is the web app for Mozilla Common Voice, a platform for collecting speech donations in order to create public domain datasets for training voice recognition-related tools. Version 1.88.2 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting given that user-controlled data flows to a path expression (path of a network request). This issue may lead to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the context of Common Voiceâ€™s server origin. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether any patches or workarounds exist.
