Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the `mdi-icon` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that execute whenever a user accesses that page. This could lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing web pages
    - Other malicious actions depending on the injected script

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `mdi-icon` shortcode provided by the Material Design Icons plugin. By manipulating the attributes of this shortcode, malicious JavaScript can be injected into the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This access level allows the user to create posts/pages with the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
- The plugin has been closed (removed from the WordPress plugin directory) due to this security issue and is not available for download
- No patch is available.
- The affected version is Material Design Icons <= 0.0.5.
