- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of validation of the max-length value in ROA objects. Routinator passes through the provided value without checking if it exceeds the maximum prefix length of the address family.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper input validation; specifically, a missing check on the max-length value within ROAs.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  RTR clients reject the entire RPKI data set, effectively disabling Route Origin Validation. This means routers won't be able to validate the origin of routes, potentially leading to routing of traffic to unintended destinations if they use RPKI data to make routing decisions.
- **Attack vectors:**  A malicious or misconfigured RPKI CA can create a ROA with an invalid max-length value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence or control an RPKI CA to create ROAs with oversized max-length values.
