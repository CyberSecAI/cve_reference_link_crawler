The CVE number for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-41531.
== Summary
Routinator prior to 0.10.0 produces invalid RTR payload if an RPKI CA uses too
large values in the max-length parameter in a ROA. This will lead to RTR
clients such as routers to reject the RPKI data set, effectively disabling
Route Origin Validation.
== Affected products
Routinator up to and including 0.9.0.
== Description
Due to lack of checking of ROA object content, Routinator will simply pass
through any max-length value provided in the ROA. However, a max-length value
must never be larger than the maximum prefix length of the address family. Data
with larger values will be considered invalid by any RTR client leading to a
rejection of the entire data set.
== Solution
Download Routinator version 0.10.0 or later.
== Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Job Snijders for reporting the issue.
