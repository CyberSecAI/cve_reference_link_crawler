Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `email` parameter within the admin login mechanism of the courier management system. The `email` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection attack can have several impacts:
    - **Bypass Authentication:** Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.
    - **Read Sensitive Data:** Attackers could read sensitive data from the database.
    - **Modify Database Data:** They could insert, update, or delete data in the database.
    - **Execute Administrative Operations:** Attackers might be able to execute administrative commands on the database server, potentially shutting it down.
    - **File System Access:** In some scenarios, attackers can access files on the database server's file system.
    - **OS Command Execution:** In rare instances, they might be able to execute commands on the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `email` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No specific privilege or position is required before the attack. The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who can access the login page.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates a manual exploitation using the payload `' and 1=1-- -` to bypass admin login.
- The content also provides an example of how to use `sqlmap` to automate the exploitation using a saved HTTP request.

**Additional notes:**
- The content identifies the affected software as the "courier management system" version 1.0, hosted at sourcecodester.com.
- The content suggests the vulnerability exists in `admin_class.php`, specifically within the login process.
- The provided content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including a manual exploit and an automated exploit using sqlmap. It includes more detail than a typical CVE description.
