Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2085:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes, specifically the `size` parameter in multiple widgets of the HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Website defacement
    - Malicious redirects
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the `size` attribute of various widgets in the plugin.
- An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code, and inserts it through the `size` input field.
- This injected payload is then stored in the database and rendered to any user who visits the page, executing the injected script in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated users with at least contributor-level permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- They need access to the WordPress admin panel to modify or create content using the affected widgets.
- No specific location in the network is required, the attacker can be remote.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerable plugin is "HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor" version 2.4.6 and below.
- The fix was included in version 2.4.7, which includes sanitization and output escaping of the `size` parameter.
- The code diff from the plugin's Trac shows the specific code changes, including using `floatval` and `absint` to sanitize numeric inputs, and  `esc_url` and  `htmega_kses_title` to sanitize HTML attributes/titles.
- The vulnerability exists across several widgets of the plugin.
