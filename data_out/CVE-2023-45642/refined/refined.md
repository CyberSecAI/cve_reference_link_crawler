- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Snap Pixel plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page that triggers the request to the vulnerable plugin. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.
