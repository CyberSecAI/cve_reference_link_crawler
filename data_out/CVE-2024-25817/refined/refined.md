- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap overflow vulnerability in `eza` when processing the `.git` directory, specifically when listing files under the `.git/HEAD`, `.git/refs`, and `.git/objects` directories. It is likely caused by a related vulnerability in `libgit2` (GHSA-j2v7-4f6v-gpg8).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when `eza` processes a directory containing a `.git` directory with specific files and structure. The attack vector is local.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to execute the `eza` command on a directory structure that includes a malicious `.git` directory to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need special privileges or user interaction.
