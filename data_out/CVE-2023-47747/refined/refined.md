Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47747:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in IBM Db2 due to a specially crafted query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The weakness lies in the way IBM Db2 handles a specific type of query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through sending a specially crafted query to the Db2 server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send queries to the affected IBM Db2 instance. The NetApp advisory also indicates that the attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Db2: 10.5.0.x, 11.1.4.x, and 11.5.x.
- All platforms are affected.
- IBM has released special builds to address this issue.
- NetApp products use vulnerable versions of IBM DB2, but their advisory states that "None" of their products are affected. This seems like a contradiction, which is further clarified by the inclusion of a long list of "Products Not Affected". This implies that the vulnerability is present in an embedded component, but not exposed in the affected NetApp products.
- The NetApp advisory also lists CVE-2023-27859 and CVE-2023-47158 as part of the same advisory.
- Both IBM and NetApp note that they will not disclose further information on the vulnerability to prevent attackers from creating an exploit.
