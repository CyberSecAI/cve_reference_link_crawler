# XSS vulnerability when using JavaScript based messaging API

Moderate

[netniV](/netniV)
published
GHSA-grj5-8fcj-34gh
May 12, 2024

## Package

Cacti
(PHP)

## Affected versions

<= 1.2.26

## Patched versions

1.2.27

## Description

### Summary

CVE-2023-50250, fixed in 1.2.26, can still be triggered with a non-empty file named `"');alert(1);('".xml`.

### Details

`raise_message_javascript` from `lib/functions.php` now uses purify.js to fix CVE-2023-50250 (among others).

However it still generates the code out of unescaped PHP variables `$title` and `$header`.

If those variables contain single quotes, they can be used to inject JavaScript code.

Fix suggestion to better explain what I mean:

```
diff --git a/lib/functions.php b/lib/functions.php
index b053cdcfd..4441953d3 100644
--- a/lib/functions.php
+++ b/lib/functions.php
@@ -1050,8 +1050,8 @@ function raise_message($message_id, $message = '', $message_level = MESSAGE_LEVE
 function raise_message_javascript($title, $header, $message) {
        ?>
        <script type='text/javascript'>
-       var mixedReasonTitle = DOMPurify.sanitize('<?php print $title;?>');
-       var mixedOnPage      = DOMPurify.sanitize('<?php print $header;?>');
+       var mixedReasonTitle = DOMPurify.sanitize(<?php print json_encode($title, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);?>);
+       var mixedOnPage      = DOMPurify.sanitize(<?php print json_encode($header, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);?>);
        sessionMessage   = {
                message: DOMPurify.sanitize('<?php print $message;?>'),
                level: MESSAGE_LEVEL_MIXED

```
### PoC

Same as in [GHSA-xwqc-7jc4-xm73](https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-xwqc-7jc4-xm73 "GHSA-xwqc-7jc4-xm73") but with `"');alert(1);('".xml`.

### Impact

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized changes to settings.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-29894

### Weaknesses

[CWE-116](/advisories?query=cwe%3A116)
