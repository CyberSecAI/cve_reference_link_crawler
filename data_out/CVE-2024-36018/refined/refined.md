The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the nouveau graphics driver, specifically in how it handles address/range calculations during remap operations.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect calculations of the address and range during remap operations in the `nouveau_uvmm.c` file of the nouveau driver. The code was incorrectly calculating the unmap range by subtracting the start address from the next address. The correct calculation requires the end address instead.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect calculation of unmap range during remap operations.
- This leads to an attempt to unmap a larger memory area than intended.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Corruption of page tables.
- Kernel panic (oops).
- System instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a remap operation with specific parameters, as demonstrated by the `dEQP-VK.sparse_resources.image_rebind.2d_array.r64i.128_128_8` test case, which causes the faulty range calculation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger remap operations in the nouveau driver through user-space interaction with the graphics subsystem. Specifically, the attacker needs the ability to trigger a specific type of memory management operation related to sparse resources.

The provided information gives a good amount of detail on the root cause, vulnerability, impact and attack vector.
