## FAQ

### Compatible Themes and Plugins

Most themes and plugins are compatible with PowerPress. PowerPress is developed and tested using the default themes packaged with WordPress. These themes use WordPress best practices and adhere to theme rules set by WordPress.org. Any child theme based on these themes should also work without issue.

If you are having a problem, try [Diagnosing Feed and/or Player Issues](https://blubrry.com/support/powerpress-documentation/diagnosing-feed-andor-player-issues-with-powerpress/).

If you are having a problem specifically with the player and links, try the “Having issues?” option under PowerPress Settings > Website > PowerPress Shortcodes tab. Visit [Resolving Plugin or Theme Conflicts](https://blubrry.com/support/powerpress-documentation/media-appearance/resolving-plugin-theme-conflict-issues/) for details.

### Premium podcasting themes compatible with PowerPress

Second Line Themes are designed specifically to take advantage of built-in features, settings, and podcast episode metadata in PowerPress. The Blubrry team works with the Appendipity team during beta testing and major WordPress releases to make sure the Podcast Pro theme and PowerPress work together seamlessly.

### Why doesn’t Blubrry PowerPress support multiple enclosures in one feed item/post?

PowerPress does not allow you to include multiple media files for one feed item (blog post). This is because each podcatcher handles multiple enclosures in feeds differently. Apple Podcasts will download the first enclosure that it sees in the feed ignoring the rest. Other podcatchers and podcasting directories either pick up the first enclosure or the last in each post item. This inconsistency, combined with the fact that [Dave Winer does not recommend multiple enclosures](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2004/12/21), is why the Blubrry PowerPress does not support them.

As an alternative, PowerPress allows you to create additional custom podcast feeds and channels to associate any magnitude of media format and/or length in a blog post to specific custom feeds. For example, you can create one blog post associated with separate video and audio podcast feeds, saving you time from entering your show notes twice.

### Why doesn’t Blubrry PowerPress include media statistics built-in?

Blubrry’s PowerPress does not include media statistics built-in. This is not because Blubrry has its own statistics service, although that’s a good reason by itself. Maintaining and calculating statistics is a resource and server intensive task that would detract from an otherwise efficient WordPress podcasting plugin. We recommend using your media hosting’s web statistics to give you basic download numbers and, if you are seeking more granular measurements, such as client and geographical information for each episode, you’re more than welcome to use the [Blubrry Statistics service](https://blubrry.com/services/podcast-statistics/) as well.

### How do you insert the player within a blog post?

You can insert the media player within your blog posts by using the WordPress shortcode feature. The shortcode for PowerPress is `[powerpress]` (all lowercase).

You may use the shortcode to add a player to other media files (non episode files) by specifying the media url in the shortcode: [powerpress url=”http://example.com/path/to/media.mp3″]

For advanced users with multiple podcast feeds, you may insert the player for a specific feed by specifying the feed slug in the shortcode: [powerpress feed=”podcast”]

If you want to specify a cover image, add an image attribute which points to the specific image url: [powerpress image=”http://example.com/path/to/cover\_image.jpg”] *This is an experimental feature.*

### Why can’t you upload large media files?

File uploads are tricky to handle because there are so many web hosting variations with different upload size limits. We recommend using an FTP application to upload large media files. FTP is much more efficient than web based uploads and is typically provided by nearly all web hosting providers.

Alternatively, you can sign up for a Blubrry [hosting plan](https://blubrry.com/services/podcast-hosting/), which makes file uploads in PowerPress easier.

### The Media Player does not appear on my site (or the RSS feed is invalid)

This can happen when there is a theme or plugin conflict. Please visit our [Diagnosing Feed and/or Player Issues](https://blubrry.com/support/powerpress-documentation/diagnosing-feed-andor-player-issues-with-powerpress/) for instructions how to resolve such issues.

This plugin does not work at all. I tried it once, then deactivated and deleted it.
Later on, I decided to give it another shot. Somehow, even though I had cleared the WP cache and dropped any and all parts of the database, it remembered the podcast. So, I couldn’t import the episodes, because this stupid plugin said they already existed.
There’s no way for me to delete the podcast and start over.
Huge waste of time.

I’ve been using this now for almost 7 years, with about 250-300 podcasts per year. There have been some blips, some caused by own ignorance and some hiccups in the software but all in all it’s been a real workhorse and has been one of the focal points of the podcast. The support team is outstanding and they’ve been gracious and patient with me.
Can’t recommend this enough…
