The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Emerson's Proficy Machine Edition software. Specifically, CVE-2022-2790 is discussed in section 3.2.4.

**CVE-2022-2790**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper verification of cryptographic signatures when loading compiled logic files (.PDT) and data block files (.BLD/.BLK).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software fails to properly validate the cryptographic signatures of PDT and BLD/BLK files.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious code or manipulate data by using improperly signed files, potentially causing a change in behavior of the PLC. This could lead to unauthorized actions on the programmable logic controller (PLC).
*  **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have access to the machine running Proficy Machine Edition.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access to the system with the vulnerable software installed and the ability to provide manipulated/malicious files, and must have low privileges with the need for user interaction.
