The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities in Emerson's Proficy Machine Edition software. Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-2790:

**CVE-2022-2790: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**

*   **Root Cause:** Proficy Machine Edition does not properly verify the cryptographic signatures of compiled logic (PDT files) and data block files (BLD/BLK files).
*   **Weakness:** Improper verification of cryptographic signatures (CWE-347).
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow for remote hidden code execution on the connected programmable logic controller (PLC) and for malicious files to be uploaded from the PLC to connected workstations. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper verification of cryptographic signatures of compiled logic (PDT) and data block (BLD/BLK) files.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker with local access to the system and the ability to upload manipulated files could exploit this vulnerability. Specifically, the attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the Proficy Machine Edition software.

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected versions include Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 5.9, with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N).
*   Emerson recommends restricting users who can upload files as a mitigation.
