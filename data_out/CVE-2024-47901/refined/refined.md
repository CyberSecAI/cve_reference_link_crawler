Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-47901 and related vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2024-47901**

*   **Root Cause:** The web server of affected InterMesh devices fails to sanitize input parameters in specific GET requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
*   **Impact:** In combination with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-47902, CVE-2024-47903, CVE-2024-47904), it allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based, via crafted GET requests to the web server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote unauthenticated attacker

**CVE-2024-47902**

*   **Root Cause:** The web server does not authenticate GET requests that execute specific commands on the OS level (e.g., `ping`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)
*  **Impact:** Allows for the execution of OS commands with limited privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based, via unauthenticated GET requests to the web server.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote unauthenticated attacker

**CVE-2024-47903**

*   **Root Cause:** The web server allows writing arbitrary files to the web server's DocumentRoot directory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250)
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to write files to the web server's directory.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based, via the webserver.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote unauthenticated attacker

**CVE-2024-47904**

*   **Root Cause:** A SUID binary exists on the device that allows for arbitrary command execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266)
*   **Impact:** Allows a local, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the device.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Local authenticated attacker.

**Summary of Interdependencies**
CVE-2024-47901, CVE-2024-47902, and CVE-2024-47903 are exploited together by an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve code execution with root privileges. CVE-2024-47904 requires local access and authentication.

**Affected Products:**

*   InterMesh 7177 Hybrid 2.0 Subscriber (all versions < V8.2.12)
*   InterMesh 7707 Fire Subscriber (all versions < V7.2.12, only if the IP interface is enabled)

**Mitigations/Remediation:**

*   Update to the latest software versions:
    *   InterMesh 7177 Hybrid 2.0 Subscriber: Update to V8.2.12 or later
    *   InterMesh 7707 Fire Subscriber: Update to V7.2.12 or later
*   Disable the IP interface on InterMesh 7707 Fire Subscriber if the update cannot be applied immediately.
*   Restrict network access to the InterMesh network to trusted systems and persons only.
*   Follow general security recommendations to protect network access to affected products.
