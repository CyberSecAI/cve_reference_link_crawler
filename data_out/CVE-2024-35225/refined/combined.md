# Reflected XSS issue in host parameter

Critical

[manics](/manics)
published
GHSA-fvcq-4x64-hqxr
Jun 11, 2024

## Package

pip

jupyter\_server\_proxy
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=3.0.0,<=4.1.2

## Patched versions

==3.2.4,==4.2.0

## Description

### Impact

We have identified a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in `jupyter-server-proxy`[1]. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor.

As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. This issue exists in the latest release of `jupyter-server-proxy`, currently `v4.1.2`.

**Impacted versions:** `>=3.0.0,<=4.1.2`

### Patches

The patches are included in `==4.2.0` and `==3.2.4`.

### Workarounds

Server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension with:

```
jupyter server extension disable jupyter-server-proxy

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
