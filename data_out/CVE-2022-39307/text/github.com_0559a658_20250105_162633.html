## Patched versions

9.2.4, 8.5.15

## Description

Today we are releasing Grafana 9.2.4. Alongside other bug fixes, this patch release includes moderate security fixes for [CVE-2022-39307](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3p62-42x7-gxg5 "CVE-2022-39307").

We are also releasing security patches for Grafana 8.5.15 to fix these issues.

Release 9.2.4, latest patch, also containing security fix:

* [Download Grafana 9.2.4](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/9.2.4)

Release 8.5.15, only containing security fix:

* [Download Grafana 8.5.15](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.5.15)

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) and as always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. This is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana and Azure Managed Grafana as a service offering.

## Username enumeration

### Summary

When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the username or email does not exist, a JSON response contains a “user not found” message.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is [5.3 Moderate](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)

### Impact

The impacted endpoint leaks information to unauthenticated users and introduces a security risk.

### Impacted versions

All installations for Grafana versions Grafana <=9.x, <8.x

### Solutions and mitigations

To fully address [CVE-2022-39307](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3p62-42x7-gxg5 "CVE-2022-39307"), please upgrade your Grafana instances.

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
