Hello friend, today I’m showing you a vulnerability that I found while researching the PIX-Link LV-WR22 router, although it’s critical, it’s quite easy to exploit.

The vulnerability consists of a misconfiguration on the part of the firmware developers in the telnet configuration and the consumer is unable to change the telnet password without technical knowledge.

**Firmware Version:**

PoC:

Accessing telnet via its default port (port 23) we are asked for the username and password.

When I saw that I immediately thought…

GOTCHA!!!!

Although it’s a rather stupid vulnerability, it’s a vulnerability that we see in many systems today.

**Growth hackers don’t tolerate waste.**
