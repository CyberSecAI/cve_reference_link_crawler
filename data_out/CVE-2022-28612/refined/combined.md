How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

I guess I should have done more research before I dropped the 27.00 bucks for the premium version. Could not get it to work at all, tried everything including emailing the developer and posting on his Forum which if you check has not been looked at in over 10 months. Chalk one up for a lesson learned.

It works perfectly 🙂 I admit, I had some issues to start (due to lack of knowledge), but their support was 100% spot on! Definitely going to get the PRO version!

I use mailchimp for my newsletter, and i tried 5 or 6 other popup plugins, and they either didn’t work or did not look good. This plugin was SO easy to setup and it looks very professional. I would highly recommend. Saved me so much stress and time.

Despite the author’s claims, this plug in WILL NOT WORK with Mailchimp. I posted on the support forum and no answer. Don’t waste your time or money on this plug in until the bugs are worked out.
