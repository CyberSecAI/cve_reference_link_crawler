I guess I should have done more research before I dropped the 27.00 bucks for the premium version. Could not get it to work at all, tried everything including emailing the developer and posting on his Forum which if you check has not been looked at in over 10 months. Chalk one up for a lesson learned.

It works perfectly üôÇ I admit, I had some issues to start (due to lack of knowledge), but their support was 100% spot on! Definitely going to get the PRO version!

I use mailchimp for my newsletter, and i tried 5 or 6 other popup plugins, and they either didn‚Äôt work or did not look good. This plugin was SO easy to setup and it looks very professional. I would highly recommend. Saved me so much stress and time.

Despite the author‚Äôs claims, this plug in WILL NOT WORK with Mailchimp. I posted on the support forum and no answer. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money on this plug in until the bugs are worked out.
