The CF7 Google Sheets Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'execute_post_data_cg7_free' function in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to toggle site configuration settings, including WP_DEBUG, WP_DEBUG_LOG, SCRIPT_DEBUG, and SAVEQUERIES.
