**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Splunk platform handles error responses during SAML authentication attempts. The system's behavior allows an attacker to differentiate between error responses indicating a non-existent user and other authentication failures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The system reveals whether a user exists on the platform based on the error message received during a failed login attempt.
- Predictable error responses: The system produces different error messages based on whether a user exists or not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability enables an attacker to enumerate valid usernames on the Splunk platform. This can lead to a more focused brute-force attack on user passwords.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can send login requests using SAML authentication. By analyzing the different error responses, they can distinguish between valid and invalid usernames.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the Splunk instance configured to use SAML authentication.
- No user credentials or prior privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attack can be carried out remotely without prior authentication.
