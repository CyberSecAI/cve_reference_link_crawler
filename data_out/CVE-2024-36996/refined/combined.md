**CWE:** [CWE-204](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-3072

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.109, an attacker could determine whether or not another user exists on the instance by deciphering the error response that they receive from the instance when they attempt to log in. This disclosure could then lead to additional brute-force password-guessing attacks.

This vulnerability would require that the Splunk platform instance uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication scheme.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.2 | SAML | 9.2.0 to 9.2.1 | 9.2.2 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.1 | SAML | 9.1.0 to 9.1.4 | 9.1.5 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | SAML | 9.0.0 to 9.0.9 | 9.0.10 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.1.2312 | SAML | Below 9.1.2312.109 | 9.1.2312.109 |
