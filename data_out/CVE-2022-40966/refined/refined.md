**Root cause of vulnerability:** Authentication Bypass (CWE-288)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The affected Buffalo network devices are vulnerable to an authentication bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A network-adjacent attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms for the device.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the device (high impact to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network-adjacent attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N), and no privileges are required (PR:N).
