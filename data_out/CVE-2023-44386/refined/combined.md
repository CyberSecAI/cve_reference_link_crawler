# Incorrect request error handling triggers server crash

Moderate

[gwynne](/gwynne)
published
GHSA-3mwq-h3g6-ffhm
Oct 5, 2023

## Package

swift

vapor
([Swift](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aswift))

## Affected versions

4.83.2...4.84.1

## Patched versions

4.84.2

## Description

Vapor incorrectly handles errors encountered during parsing of HTTP 1.x requests, triggering a precondition failure in swift-nio due to API misuse and causing immediate termination of the server process.

### Impact

This is a denial of service vulnerability, impacting all users of affected versions of Vapor. Because the crash is an explicit assertion failure, there is no corruption of process state and no risk of data leakage or unauthorized code execution. Total impact is limited to an immediately recoverable service interruption.

### Patches

The issue is fixed as of Vapor release 4.84.2.

### Workarounds

None known at this time.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the Vapor repo](https://github.com/vapor/vapor)
* Ask in [Vapor Discord](http://vapor.team)

### Acknowledgements

Full credit for reporting this issue goes to [@t0rchwo0d](https://github.com/t0rchwo0d), with additional thanks for responsibly disclosing.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

```
* Fix the HTTP1 error handler to close connections when HTTP parse errors occur instead of passing them on.

* Move the error handling for parser errors into HTTPServerRequestDecoder, where it arguably belongs. Don't send 400 bad request for those errors (not required by RFC, difficult to do safely for all cases), fix inbound user event handling in multiple handlers.
```

⚠️ Security Update ⚠️

This release fixes an issue introduced in 4.83.2 Vapor incorrectly handles errors encountered during parsing of HTTP 1.x requests, making it vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. For more details see the [security advisory GHSA-qvxg-wjxc-r4gg](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/security/advisories/GHSA-3mwq-h3g6-ffhm).

This vulnerability has been designated as `CVE-2023-44386`. Thank you to [t0rchwood](https://github.com/t0rchwo0d) for reporting!
