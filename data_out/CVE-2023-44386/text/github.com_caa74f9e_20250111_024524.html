```
* Fix the HTTP1 error handler to close connections when HTTP parse errors occur instead of passing them on.

* Move the error handling for parser errors into HTTPServerRequestDecoder, where it arguably belongs. Don't send 400 bad request for those errors (not required by RFC, difficult to do safely for all cases), fix inbound user event handling in multiple handlers.
```
