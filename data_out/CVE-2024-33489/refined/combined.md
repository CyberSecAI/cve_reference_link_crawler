SSA-589937: Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge

| Publication Date: | 2024-05-14 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-05-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Solid Edge is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application is parsing PAR files. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected application, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released a new version for Solid Edge and recommends to update to the latest version.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-33489

The affected application is vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow while parsing specially crafted PAR files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
