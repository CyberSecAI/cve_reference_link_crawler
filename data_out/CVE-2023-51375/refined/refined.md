Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the EmbedPress plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be reserved for higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a broken access control issue (OWASP A1). This means that the plugin does not properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user (e.g., a subscriber) can perform actions that require higher privileges.
*   The specific impact will vary depending on the context of the vulnerable function.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable function within the EmbedPress plugin, which lacks proper access controls.
*   An attacker would need to identify and interact with the vulnerable function to exploit the broken access control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user of the WordPress site, even with the lowest privileges (subscriber).

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
*   The vulnerable versions are EmbedPress plugin <= 3.8.3.
*   The fixed version is 3.8.4.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack.
