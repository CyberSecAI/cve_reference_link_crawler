- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks within a function of the Progressive WordPress (PWA) plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The plugin fails to adequately verify user privileges before allowing actions, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute privileged functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact will vary based on the context.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to exploit the vulnerable function(s) by sending requests without proper authentication, nonce token or authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber" user, which is a low-level user role in WordPress.
