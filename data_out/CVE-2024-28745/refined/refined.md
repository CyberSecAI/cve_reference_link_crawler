- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "ABEMA" App for Android fails to restrict access permissions, specifically by not properly controlling access to arbitrary URLs within the app via Intent. This is identified as a CWE-926 issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The app lacks proper access control, allowing other applications on the same device to send Intents to the "ABEMA" app and display arbitrary URLs. This is an Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to display arbitrary websites within the "ABEMA" app. This could lead to phishing attacks, where a malicious website mimics a legitimate one to steal user credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have another app installed on the victim's Android device. The attack is triggered by sending a crafted Intent to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires the ability to install an application on the same Android device as the vulnerable "ABEMA" app and the ability to send intents to the vulnerable application to display arbitrary URLs in the app. The attacker requires user interaction for the victim to fall victim to the attack (e.g., if they were to interact with the arbitrary website, especially during a phishing attempt).
