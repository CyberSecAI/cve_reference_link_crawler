The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "User Registration & Login and User Management System v3.0" application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user or admin views the affected data, the injected JavaScript code executes in their browser. This can lead to:
  - Stealing of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
  - Defacement of the web application.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the user registration page where the attacker can insert the payload through the `fname`, `lname`, `email` or `contact` fields.
- The payload gets executed when the user or an administrator logs in and views the stored data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to access the registration page of the vulnerable application.
- No other privilege level is required.
