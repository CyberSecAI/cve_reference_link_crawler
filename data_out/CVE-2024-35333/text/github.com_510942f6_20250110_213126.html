# CVE-2024-35333

A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the charset handling functionality of html2xhtml version 1.3. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input, which would lead to the overflow of the 'buf' variable located on the stack. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the application, leading to denial of service.

## Crash Out Phase

To reproduce the crash let's go to the project website and download the latest version 1.3.

Once we have the tar file, we can run `tar xvf XYZ.tar`

Run:

```
./configure
make
./html2xhtml poc.html

```

You should receive a segmentation fault. Let's analyze this with Address Sanitizer.

Run:

```
make clean
make CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address
./html2xhtml poc.html

```

Receive the output:

```

## Root Cause Analysis

Let's take a look at the source code and review the vulnerable function: read\_charset\_decl(). The function is over 100 lines of code.
We'll simplify it and take a look at this particular loop.

```
  for (i = ini, len = 0; i < avail && len < SCAN_LEN; i += step, len++) {
    buf[len] = tolower(buffer[i]);
  }
```

This loop copies data from the buffer array to buf, converting characters to lower case as it goes. The problem is when avail is greater than SCAN\_LEN and the loop does not check for the upper bounds of buf being exceeded.

In order to mitigate there should be bounds checking to make sure len does not exceed SCAN\_LEN.
