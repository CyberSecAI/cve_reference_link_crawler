### Summary:
The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Fonto - Custom Web Fonts Manager WordPress plugin, specifically related to the upload of SVG files. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2024-8920.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the plugin. The plugin failed to properly sanitize the uploaded SVG files, which could contain malicious JavaScript code within them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are permanently stored on the server and executed when the SVG file is accessed.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-supplied SVG file content before saving it to the server.
- Insufficient Output Escaping: The plugin does not properly escape the SVG content, preventing it from being interpreted as code when accessed in a browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. This allows attackers to perform actions like:
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Steal session cookies.
  - Deface the website.
  - Perform actions on behalf of logged-in users.
- Wide Scope of Impact: The XSS vulnerability is triggered when a user accesses the malicious SVG file, potentially affecting many site visitors.

**Attack vectors:**
- SVG File Upload: Attackers upload a specially crafted SVG file through the plugin's interface. This malicious file contains JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated Access: Attackers need to be authenticated with at least Author-level access to the WordPress site to upload SVG files using the plugin.

**Additional Details**

- **Affected versions:** All versions of the Fonto plugin up to and including 1.2.1 are vulnerable.
- **Patch details:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.2 by implementing SVG sanitization.
- **Sanitization mechanism:** The fix involves removing `<script>` elements and unsafe attributes (such as `onclick`, `onload`, and `javascript:`) from the uploaded SVG content, also generating a unique filename for the uploaded SVG file.

The vulnerability is classified as medium severity, with a CVSS score of 6.4, indicating that the potential for exploitation and impact exists.
