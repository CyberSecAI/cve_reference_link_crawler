## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Social Media Widget < 4.0.9 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

When creating a new widget, insert the following payload in the "VK URL" field - 123" onmouseover='alert(/XSS/)'
Note: Other fields are also vulnerable

### Affects Plugins
