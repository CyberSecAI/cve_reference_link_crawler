Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'user-search' shortcode of the Front End Users plugin. Specifically, the `display_field` attribute is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input in the `display_field` attribute, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This code is then stored in the database and executed in the browsers of users who view the page containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into web pages, potentially leading to various malicious activities, such as:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive user data.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites to install malware.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or content of the website.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is the `user-search` shortcode. An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code within the `display_field` attribute of the shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site with Contributor-level access or higher. This level of access allows the attacker to create or edit content (posts or pages) where they can insert the malicious shortcode.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is specifically located in the `Insert_User_Search.php` file of the plugin.
- The vulnerable code includes lines where the `display_field` attribute is not properly sanitized before being used in HTML output.
- The fix involves using `esc_html` and `esc_attr` to sanitize the output.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a changelog entry for version 3.2.29 which mentions "Security update. Updated escaping.", confirming that the vulnerability was addressed in that version.
- The Wordfence article provides a good explanation of the vulnerability and its impact, and also mentions Peter Thaleikis as the researcher who discovered the vulnerability.
