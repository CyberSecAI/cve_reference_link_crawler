- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker could insert crafted input into various data fields in the affected interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco FMC software. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
