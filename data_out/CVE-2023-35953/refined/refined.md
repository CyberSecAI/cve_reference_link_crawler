    "CVE-2023-35953": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `readOFF` function of the libigl library. When parsing an OFF file, the code attempts to read comments using `fscanf` with an unbounded format string `%[^\\n]`, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow if a long comment (without a newline character) is encountered in the vertices section.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Unbounded format string in `fscanf`"

      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists within the `readOFF` function where the code reads the header of the OFF file using `fscanf` with an unbounded format string `%s\\n`, which can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow when writing into the `header` buffer on the stack if the header is too long.",

It uses `fscanf` with an unbounded format string `%[#]` to identify comment lines, writing to a single byte stack buffer called `tic_tac_toe`. This causes a buffer overflow when reading long comment strings, especially when a charset `%[ ]` specifier is used because it appends a null byte, resulting in a write of more than one byte.",
