- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied fields within incoming HTTP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows (CWE-120) and command injection (CWE-77)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with root-level privileges on the affected device, or unexpected device restart leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires valid Administrator credentials on the affected device and the ability to send a malicious HTTP request to the web interface. The management interface is accessible through the LAN and through the WAN connection if remote management is enabled.
