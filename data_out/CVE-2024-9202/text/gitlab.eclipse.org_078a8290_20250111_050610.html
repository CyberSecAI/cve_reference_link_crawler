# EDC DataSetResolver policy filtering

The Eclipse Foundation is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE) Numbering Authority. This issue it used to request and track the progress of the assignment of a CVE for a vulnerability in the project code for an Eclipse open source project.

## Basic information

**Project name:** Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC)

**Project id:** technology.edc

**Request type:** publication

**Versions affected:** EDC versions from [0.1.3, 0.9.0] and fixed for versions >= 0.9.1

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System:** We rate the vulnerability as CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N/E:U/RE:M/U:Amber, see {[cvss](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N/E:U/RE:M/U:Amber)}

**Summary:**

In Eclipse Dataspace Components versions 0.1.3 to 0.9.0, the Connector component filters which datasets (= data offers) another party can see in a requested catalog, to ensure that only authorized parties are able to view restricted offers.
However, there is the possibility to request a single dataset, which should be subject to the same filtering process, but currently is missing the correct filtering.

This enables parties to potentially see datasets they should not have access to, thereby exposing sensitive information. Exploiting this vulnerability requires knowing the ID of a restricted dataset, but some IDs may be guessed by trying out many IDs in an automated way.

Affected code:
[DatasetResolverImpl, L76-79](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/blob/v0.9.0/core/control-plane/control-plane-catalog/src/main/java/org/eclipse/edc/connector/controlplane/catalog/DatasetResolverImpl.java)

* [Backport 0.9.1](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/pull/4491)
