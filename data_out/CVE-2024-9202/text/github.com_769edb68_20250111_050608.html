### @ronjaquensel **[ronjaquensel](/ronjaquensel)** commented [Sep 25, 2024](#issue-2547310160)

## What this PR changes/adds

Adds a check to the `DatasetResolverImpl` to only return a dataset if it has an offer attached.

## Why it does that

To avoid exposing sensitive information (asset metadata) if the requesting participant is not authorized to see it.

## Further notes

Also adds a check for `query` and `getById` to immediately return if no valid contract definitions exist for the requesting participant, as then no offers would be returned anyway, so it doesn't make sense to query and evaluate the assets in that case.

Sorry, something went wrong.
