Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `DatasetResolverImpl` of the Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC). Specifically, when a single dataset is requested, the code fails to apply the same filtering process that is used when requesting a catalog of datasets. This lack of filtering allows unauthorized parties to potentially access restricted datasets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper access control checks when a single dataset is queried by ID. While the catalog listing is filtered, the single dataset retrieval is not, leading to an inconsistency in how access is enforced.
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to the potential exposure of sensitive asset metadata to unauthorized parties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive dataset metadata that they should not have access to.
- **Data Leakage:** If the metadata contains sensitive information, it can be leaked to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Dataset ID Request:** An attacker must know or guess the ID of a restricted dataset. They can then make a direct request for the dataset by its ID.
- **Automated ID Guessing:** Attackers can attempt to automate the process of guessing dataset IDs to discover restricted datasets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the EDC connector.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to interact with the EDC connector.
- **Dataset ID:** The attacker must know or be able to guess the ID of a restricted dataset.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in EDC versions from 0.1.3 to 0.9.0 and is fixed in version 0.9.1 and later.
- The fix involves adding a check in `DatasetResolverImpl` to ensure that only datasets with valid offers are returned.
- The fix also adds a check for `query` and `getById` to immediately return if no valid contract definitions exist for the requesting participant, which prevents unnecessary querying and evaluating of assets.
- The affected code is located in `DatasetResolverImpl.java`, specifically lines 76-79.

**CVSS:**

The provided CVSS score is CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N/E:U/RE:M/U:Amber

**In summary:** The vulnerability is a missing access control check that enables unauthorized disclosure of sensitive dataset metadata through direct dataset ID requests.
