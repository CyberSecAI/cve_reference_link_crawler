- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requires no privileges, and user interaction (opening a crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to craft a malicious file that triggers the out-of-bounds write vulnerability when opened in the vulnerable Adobe InDesign versions.
