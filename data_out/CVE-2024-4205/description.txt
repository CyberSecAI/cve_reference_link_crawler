The Premium Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the get_template_content() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.31. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve Elementor template data.
