The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2022-01-17 22:30:36 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2007512#c0)  Paramvir jindal    2021-09-24 06:19:53 UTC  ``` For each SAML client it is possible to send an AuthnRequest message via SOAP with Basic Authorization header and Keycloak will successfully authenticate the user for the client and will not consider the authentication flow applied.  The presence of the flow is hidden from the administrator, it is not possible to disable it in the client's configuration similarly as direct grant etc.  <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KEYCLOAK-19177>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2007512#c1)  Paramvir jindal    2021-09-24 06:21:07 UTC  ``` Issue can be replicated in RHSSO 7.5 hence I am marking it as affected/fix and creating tracker.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2007512#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-01-17 21:30:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.5 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:0152 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0152](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0152)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2007512#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-01-17 21:31:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.5 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2022:0151 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0151](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0151)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2007512#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-01-17 21:46:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHSSO 7.5.1  Via RHSA-2022:0155 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0155](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0155)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2007512#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-01-17 22:30:34 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
