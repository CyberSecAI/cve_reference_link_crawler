The content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `mergeObjects` function in the `@chargeover/redoc` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `mergeObjects` function does not properly sanitize or validate input when merging objects, allowing an attacker to inject a `__proto__` property into an object being merged. This leads to the modification of the `Object.prototype`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By modifying the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can alter the behavior of all objects that inherit from it. This can potentially lead to denial of service, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting attacks, depending on the specific application and how the prototype pollution is leveraged.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker calls the vulnerable `mergeObjects` function with an argument containing the special property `__proto__`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to control the input to the `mergeObjects` function. This would typically involve being able to pass a crafted object to the function as an argument.
