| Issue Details A security issue was discovered in [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.  This issue has been rated **High** ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)), and assigned **[CVE-2021-25745](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pvmg-xgmx-9mxh "CVE-2021-25745")**. Affected Components and Configurations This bug affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running `kubectl get po -n ingress-nginx`.  Multitenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Ingress objects are most affected by this issue. Affected Versions  * <v1.2.0  Fixed Versions  * v1.2.0-beta.0 * v1.2.0  Mitigation If you are unable to roll out the fix, this vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing an admission policy that restricts the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field on the `networking.k8s.io/Ingress` resource to known safe characters (see the newly added [rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blame/main/internal/ingress/inspector/rules.go), or the suggested value for [annotation-value-word-blocklist](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#annotation-value-word-blocklist)). Detection If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io Additional Details See ingress-nginx Issue [#8502](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126812) for more details. Acknowledgements This vulnerability was reported by Gafnit Amiga.  Thank You, CJ Cullen on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee |

| Should the [invalidSecretsDir](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/83107e0af40b99066b6a72faf33d95a969d17b18/internal/ingress/inspector/rules.go#L28) regex be updated to `/run/secrets`? In the default ingress-nginx image, `/var/run` is symlinked to `/run`, so the service account token can be accessed through `/run/secrets`:  ``` bash-5.1$ ls -l /var/run lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             4 Apr  4 16:07 /var/run -> /run bash-5.1$ ls -l /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ total 0 lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            13 Apr 22 17:44 ca.crt -> ..data/ca.crt lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            16 Apr 22 17:44 namespace -> ..data/namespace lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            12 Apr 22 17:44 token -> ..data/token bash-5.1$  ```  Updating the regex to `/run/secrets` would block both paths. |

| [@cjcullen](https://github.com/cjcullen) , I am trying to experience this exploit in a instance of the ingress-nginx-controller, with chroot enabled on the nginx process.  Can you help me gt a example value for the spec `ingress.spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` that will demonstrate this vulnerability, on a chrooted nginx process of the controller. |

| As the rules for deep inspect are hard-coded in the code. Also as mentioned above by [@fhke](https://github.com/fhke) some rules are missed. So it doesn't look like fixed in 1.2.0 just by upgrading. May be just like bad annotation list these rules also should be exposed to user. |

| [@bmv126](https://github.com/bmv126) this was discussed in the last community meeting. Maintainers were aware of this and are working on it from even before the issue was created or maybe even before the CVE was published.  The controller v1.20 introduces capability to jail/charoot the nginx process so it has been tested that the obvious use case of getting a shell, by breaking out of the nginx process, will land the actor in a jailed/chrooted shell, if at all. That is one layer of protection.  If you want to discuss further, it was reported that users can use this link <https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/SECURITY.md> and be discreet about putting sensitive info in public places. You could also reach out to maintainers without including groups in such communication, so as to reduce the radius for info spread. |
