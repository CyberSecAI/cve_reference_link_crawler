- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect access control mechanisms in the Silex DS-600 firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper access control allows unauthorized modification of device settings. Specifically, the "SAVE EEP_DATA" command via UDP on port 19540 is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can edit device settings, potentially leading to information compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending the "SAVE EEP_DATA" command via UDP on port 19540.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the device on the specified port, which implies network accessibility to the device.
