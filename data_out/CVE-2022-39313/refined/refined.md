{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of the range parameter within file download requests. Specifically, the server fails to handle invalid byte range requests correctly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation leading to server crashes.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The server crashes, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks by sending a file download request with an invalid byte range parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the parse-server, and no special privileges or user interaction is needed."
