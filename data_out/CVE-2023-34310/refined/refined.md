- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper initialization of memory before it is accessed during the parsing of CO files by Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uninitialized memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to get the victim to visit a malicious page or open a malicious CO file, thus requiring user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to deliver a specially crafted CO file or host a malicious page that exploits the vulnerability, and the victim has to interact with the malicious content.
