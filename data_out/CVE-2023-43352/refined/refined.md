The provided content is related to CVE-2023-43352.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) issue due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided content within the "Content Manager" of CMSmadesimple. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a template.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing the injection of template code that is then executed by the server-side template engine. The application uses the Smarty template engine.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by injecting malicious template code. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious code through the "Content - Content Manager Menu" by editing the "Content" field. When the affected page is accessed, the injected code is executed server-side by the template engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a local account with access to the CMS admin panel.
