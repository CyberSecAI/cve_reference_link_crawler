- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling GIF files, which leads to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. The vulnerability can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability through user interaction by enticing the target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to present the user with a malicious page or file, requiring user interaction for exploitation.
