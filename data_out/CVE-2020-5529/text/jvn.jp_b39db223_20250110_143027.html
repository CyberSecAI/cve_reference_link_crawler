# JVN#34535327 HtmlUnit vulenerable to arbitrary code execution

## Overview

HtmlUnit contains code execution vulnerabitilies.

## Products Affected

* HtmlUnit prior to 2.37.0

## Description

HtmlUnit is a Java-based library which provides web browser functionality to Java programs, and it supports JavaScript evaluation with embedded Mozilla Rhino engine.

Mozilla Rhino engine offers a feature to make Java objects available from JavaScript.

HtmlUnit initializes Rhino engine improperly, hence a malicious JavScript code can execute arbitrary Java code on the application([CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)).

Moreover, when embedded in Android application, Android-specific initialization of Rhino engine is done in an improper way, hence a malicious JavaScript code can execute arbitrary Java code on the application.

## Impact

Through man-in-the-middle attack or in some other way, an attacker may lead the target application to evaluate malicious JavaScript code, which executes arbitrary Java code.

## Solution

**Update the Software**

Update to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

## Vendor Status

| Vendor | Link |
| --- | --- |
| HtmlUnit | [Release HtmlUnit-2.37.0](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit/releases/tag/2.37.0) |
