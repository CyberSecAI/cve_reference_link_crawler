Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-0708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin failing to properly restrict access to landing pages, making it possible for unauthenticated users to view them even when they are intended to be private.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The core vulnerability is the exposure of potentially private landing page content to unauthorized users. This could include marketing materials, coming soon content, or any other information the site owner intends to keep hidden from public view.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The plugin does not adequately check user permissions before rendering a landing page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain access to potentially sensitive information contained within the landing pages.
- **Premature Content Exposure:** Landing pages intended to be private or released at a later date can be viewed prematurely by the public.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack vector is through direct access to a landing page URL using a `landingpage` GET parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need any specific user account or permissions on the target WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Landing Page IDs:** The attacker needs to know the ID of a landing page, which may be revealed by other site features or via other enumeration methods.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.7.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.3.
- The Wordfence article mentions the vulnerability was publicly published on February 14, 2024.
- The plugin's `landing.php` file was modified to add a check for `disabled` mode and user capabilities using the following code:
   ```php
   if( $mode === 'disabled' && !current_user_can('edit_posts') ) {
        return $template;
   }
  ```
