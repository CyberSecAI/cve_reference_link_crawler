Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12760:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `parso` handles grammar parsing from the cache. It uses `pickle` for serialization and deserialization of cached grammar files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is the use of `pickle.load` to deserialize cached grammar files. `pickle` is known to be unsafe when used with untrusted data, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution during deserialization.
- **Predictable Cache Path:** The path to the cache file is predictable, making it easier for an attacker to target specific files. The path is based on the Python implementation, version, and hash of the grammar file and the dummy path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing a malicious pickled object to a cache file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the system when the vulnerable application loads the grammar using the `parso` library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Write Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write files to the cache directory used by the `parso` library. This could be achieved through a vulnerability in a web server (e.g. file upload) or any other means allowing write access.
- **Trigger Grammar Parsing:** The attacker needs to trigger the application to load the grammar, which involves a call to `parso.load_grammar()` and then `g.parse` with `cache=True`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Write access to the parso cache directory:**  The attacker must be able to write files to the location where `parso` stores its cache, or be able to modify the cache path to a user-controlled one.
- **Ability to trigger the vulnerable code path:** The attacker must be able to cause the vulnerable application to invoke the `parso` library's parsing function with the cache enabled. This could be achieved by sending crafted input to a web server or any other application using the library.
- **Knowledge of Python version:** The attacker needs to know the Python major and minor version digits and implementation used by the target application.
- **Knowledge of target's parso cache path or ability to modify it:** As mentioned above, knowledge of the path or ability to modify it is required for a successful exploit.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was reported to the upstream maintainer.
- The maintainer acknowledges the issue and has added a warning in the API docs.
- The maintainer has also opened an issue to replace pickle with a safer serialization option.
- It is disputed whether this constitutes a real vulnerability, as the attacker needs write access to the file system, which in itself could allow for other means of code execution.
- Some users argue that the issue is not with `parso` but the way it is used in certain applications.
- The vulnerability is considered unlikely to be exploited in the wild but it is still a vulnerability due to the use of `pickle` with user-controllable values.

The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates how to generate a malicious pickle payload, compute the correct cache path, and trigger the vulnerable code path.
