Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A goroutine was launched in containerd's CRI stream server to handle terminal resize events when a TTY is requested.
- If the user's process failed to launch, the goroutine would get stuck waiting to send resize events without a receiver, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Goroutine Leak:** The primary weakness is the uncontrolled creation of goroutines that become orphaned and consume resources when the associated process fails to start. This leak is specifically triggered when the stream server attempts to send terminal resize events to a process that does not exist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Host Memory Exhaustion:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential to exhaust host memory by repeatedly triggering the goroutine leak. This can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions on the host system, affecting all services running on the same host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CRI Stream Server:** The vulnerability is present in the CRI stream server, used for handling container I/O in containerd.
- **Faulty Container Launch:** The vulnerability can be triggered when a container process fails to launch (e.g., due to a faulty command).
- **Terminal Resize:** The vulnerability relies on sending terminal resize events.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Initiate Container Execution:** An attacker must be able to initiate container execution via the CRI interface, whether through Kubernetes, `crictl`, or a similar tool.
- **Control Over Container Configuration:** The attacker must be able to specify a TTY for the container.
- **Ability to cause a container launch failure:** The attacker needs to cause a failure in the container launch that will orphan the resize event handler, leading to the memory leak. This could be done with a non-existent command or faulty setup.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in containerd versions 1.6.12 and 1.5.16.
- The provided commit fixes the issue by adding context awareness to the `handleResizeEvents` goroutine, allowing it to exit if the HTTP request is closed (which occurs when process launch fails).
- The Gentoo security advisory also lists this CVE along with several others, and recommends upgrading to version 1.6.14 or later.
