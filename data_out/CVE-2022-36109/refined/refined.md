Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Moby (Docker Engine) sets up supplementary group permissions within containers. Specifically, when using the `USER $USERNAME` instruction in a Dockerfile, supplementary groups are not configured correctly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper handling of supplementary group access within containers.
- The `USER $USERNAME` Dockerfile instruction does not set up supplementary groups correctly.
- This could lead to a container process bypassing primary group restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker with direct access to a container could manipulate their supplementary group access.
- By manipulating supplementary group access, an attacker may be able to bypass primary group restrictions within the container.
- This could lead to:
    - Gaining access to sensitive information.
    - Gaining the ability to execute code within the container.

**Attack vectors:**

- Direct access to a container is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate their supplementary group access within the container.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have direct access to the vulnerable container.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate their supplementary group access after gaining access.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) version 20.10.18.
- A workaround is to avoid using the `USER $USERNAME` Dockerfile instruction and instead using `ENTRYPOINT ["su", "-", "user"]`. This will ensure that supplementary groups are set up correctly.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by Steven Murdoch.
