### Client

### Daemon

* Fix a security vulnerability relating to supplementary group permissions, which

  could allow a container process to bypass primary group restrictions within the

  container [CVE-2022-36109](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-36109), [GHSA-rc4r-wh2q-q6c4](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-rc4r-wh2q-q6c4).
* seccomp: add support for Landlock syscalls in default policy [moby/moby#43991](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/43991).
* seccomp: update default policy to support new syscalls introduced in kernel 5.12 - 5.16 [moby/moby#43991](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/43991).
* Fix an issue where cache lookup for image manifests would fail, resulting

  in a redundant round-trip to the image registry [moby/moby#44109](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/44109).
* Fix an issue where `exec` processes and healthchecks were not terminated

  when they timed out [moby/moby#44018](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/44018).

### Packaging

* Update Docker Buildx to [v0.9.1](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.9.1).
* Update Docker Compose to [v2.10.2](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.10.2).
* Update containerd (`containerd.io` package) to [v1.6.8](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.8).
* Update runc to [v1.1.4](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.4).
* Update Go runtime to [1.18.6](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.18.minor),
