- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer in the Dynamic DNS client within My Cloud firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack could be used to intercept a Dynamic DNS update request and respond with a crafted payload designed to overflow the buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned to perform a MitM attack, allowing them to intercept and modify network traffic between the My Cloud device and the Dynamic DNS server.
