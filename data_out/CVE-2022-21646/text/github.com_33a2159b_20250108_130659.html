| Reproduction: <https://play.authzed.com/s/Ay9ZZJBrGDKu> (check validation tab)  As I run some experiments with the new wildcard permissions feature, I stumbled upon an apparently unexpected behaviour when doing lookup/expand. Permissions that effectively end up in `user* & userset` behave correctly with Check API, but not with Lookup/Expand API (which is presumably what's used in the `validation` tab in the playground).  In the original issue, we discussed that SpiceDB will have special treatment to `user:*` relationship when performing Lookup/Expand API, which is reasonable because it would lead to "listing all public resources" phenomenon. However, when `user:*` is chained with other algebraic operators like `&` and `-`, I think the current implementation semantics seem unexpected. The desirable outcome would be:  `<user:userset> - <user:*> = empty` `<user:userset> & <user:*> = <user:userset>` |

| Appears that we need to support wildcard in the subjectset that the developer API is using for its expected relations determination:   [spicedb/pkg/membership/membership.go](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/blob/6f66209fc42a5eea5b89da84b8aef5c514053d63/pkg/membership/membership.go#L192)  Line 192 in [6f66209](/authzed/spicedb/commit/6f66209fc42a5eea5b89da84b8aef5c514053d63)   |  | func newSubjectSet() \*subjectSet { | | --- | --- | |

| After discussion, we might also need to do handle in Lookup (Expand already has it in the correct place) |
