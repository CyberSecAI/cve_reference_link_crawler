# Lookup operations do not take into account wildcards in intersections or exclusions

High

GHSA-7p8f-8hjm-wm92
Jan 11, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/authzed/spicedb
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

v1.3.0

## Patched versions

v1.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource as "accessible" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion.

For example, given schema:

```
definition user {}

definition resource {
   relation viewer: user
   relation banned: user | user:*
   permission view = viewer - banned
}

```

If `user:*` is placed into the `banned` relation for a particular resource, `view` should return false for *all* resources. in `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion.

### Workarounds

Don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions.
