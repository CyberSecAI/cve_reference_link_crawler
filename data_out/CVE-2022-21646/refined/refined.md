Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how wildcard relationships were handled within the `Lookup` and `LookupResources` operations in SpiceDB, specifically when used in conjunction with intersection or exclusion operations. The lookup dispatch logic was not correctly processing wildcard relationships present on the right-hand side of an exclusion or within an intersection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Wildcard Handling:**  The core issue was the failure to properly account for wildcard relationships (`user:*`) when these were part of an intersection or exclusion of a user set.
- **Bypass of Exclusion:** When `user:*` was used in the `banned` relation of a `viewer - banned` permission, it was not correctly applied in lookups, effectively bypassing the intended exclusion and making the resource appear accessible to all users.
- **Incorrect Intersection Logic:**  Similar to exclusions, the intersection logic was also failing to incorporate wildcards properly, leading to unexpected results in the lookup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Incorrect Authorization:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to resources by exploiting this vulnerability, where a permission check would incorrectly return a "true" result, even if a user should have been denied access.
- **Data Exposure:** This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information that should have been restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the use of the `Lookup` or `LookupResources` API of SpiceDB.
- An attacker would need to craft a permission definition using wildcard relationships within intersections or the right-hand side of exclusions, then make use of the `Lookup` or `LookupResources` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to define permission schemas that leverage wildcards in the mentioned operators, and be able to invoke the `Lookup` or `LookupResources` API.
- The attacker needs to know about the presence of the vulnerability and craft the access control policies and make the queries to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in SpiceDB version `v1.3.0` and was fixed in `v1.4.0`.
- The fix involved changes to the graph and membership packages to correctly handle wildcard relationships during lookup operations.
- The vulnerability is described as "High" severity.
- The issue was discovered and reported by `vroldanbet`.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE ID `CVE-2022-21646`.
