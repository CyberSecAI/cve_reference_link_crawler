| Reproduction: <https://play.authzed.com/s/Ay9ZZJBrGDKu> (check validation tab)  As I run some experiments with the new wildcard permissions feature, I stumbled upon an apparently unexpected behaviour when doing lookup/expand. Permissions that effectively end up in `user* & userset` behave correctly with Check API, but not with Lookup/Expand API (which is presumably what's used in the `validation` tab in the playground).  In the original issue, we discussed that SpiceDB will have special treatment to `user:*` relationship when performing Lookup/Expand API, which is reasonable because it would lead to "listing all public resources" phenomenon. However, when `user:*` is chained with other algebraic operators like `&` and `-`, I think the current implementation semantics seem unexpected. The desirable outcome would be:  `<user:userset> - <user:*> = empty` `<user:userset> & <user:*> = <user:userset>` |

# Lookup operations do not take into account wildcards in intersections or exclusions

High

[josephschorr](/josephschorr)
published
GHSA-7p8f-8hjm-wm92
Jan 11, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/authzed/spicedb
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

v1.3.0

## Patched versions

v1.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource as "accessible" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion.

For example, given schema:

```
definition user {}

definition resource {
   relation viewer: user
   relation banned: user | user:*
   permission view = viewer - banned
}

```

If `user:*` is placed into the `banned` relation for a particular resource, `view` should return false for *all* resources. in `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion.

### Workarounds

Don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions.
