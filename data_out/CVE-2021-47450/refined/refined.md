Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47450.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2 PGDs individually. When running KVM in protected mode, the host's stage-2 PGD is managed as a single high-order compound page. This can lead to the refcount of the tail pages reaching zero prematurely, causing page table corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect refcounting of pages in concatenated stage-2 PGDs when managed as compound pages in KVM protected mode.
- Failure to account for compound page structure when managing page refcounts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Page table corruption
- Potential system instability or crashes due to memory corruption

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation would occur when running KVM in protected mode on an arm64 architecture.
- The vulnerability occurs during the management of stage-2 page tables.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the allocation of a host stage-2 PGD, which is typically related to the operations of a virtual machine or hypervisor.
- The attacker would need to have some degree of control or influence over the hypervisor's operations.
