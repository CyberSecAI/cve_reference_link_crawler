    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to code
    execution. Description: A memory corruption vulnerability was
    addressed with improved locking.

CVE-2021-30858
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.32.4.
    Credit to an anonymous researcher.
    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to
    arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue
    may have been actively exploited. Description: A use after free
    issue was addressed with improved memory management.

CVE-2021-42762
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.1.
    Credit to an anonymous reporter.
    BubblewrapLauncher.cpp allows a limited sandbox bypass that allows a
    sandboxed process to trick host processes into thinking the
    sandboxed process is not confined by the sandbox, by abusing VFS
    syscalls that manipulate its filesystem namespace. The impact is
    limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that WebKit mounts
    inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwise
    confined. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133.

We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE
WebKit. It is the best way to ensure that you are running safe versions
of WebKit. Please check our websites for information about the latest
stable releases.
