Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45347:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2023-45347 and provides specific details about the vulnerability, making it relevant.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input validation for the `*_verified` parameter in the `routers/user-router.php` resource. This parameter is directly used in an SQL query without any sanitization or filtering.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is an SQL Injection vulnerability. The application fails to validate user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data Modification:** An attacker could alter or delete data.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** In some scenarios, an attacker could gain full control of the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `routers/user-router.php` resource.
    *   The vulnerable parameter is `*_verified`, where `*` is a numerical user identifier.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, as it is unauthenticated.

**3. Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
if(preg_match("/[0-9]+_verified/",$key)){
 $key = strtok($key, '_');
 $sql = "UPDATE users SET verified = '$value' WHERE id = $key;";
 $con->query($sql);
}
```
The code uses a regular expression to identify parameters ending with `_verified` and extracts the numerical user id. However, it fails to validate the `$value` and directly includes it into an SQL query which results in an SQL Injection.

**4. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Online Food Ordering System".
*   The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 base score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
*   There is no patch available for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.

**5. Summary:**

CVE-2023-45347 is a critical, unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability that exists because the application fails to sanitize the `*_verified` parameter before using it in a database query. This allows for the possibility of data breaches, data manipulation, and complete system compromise.
