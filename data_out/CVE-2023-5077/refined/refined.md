Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Vault Google Cloud secrets engine failed to preserve existing Google Cloud IAM Conditions when creating or updating rolesets. Specifically, during the creation or update of a roleset, Vault did not copy existing IAM conditions to the newly created IAM policy binding object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing IAM Condition Preservation:** The core issue is the failure to retain existing IAM conditions when rolesets are created or updated. This means that previously configured restrictions are not carried over to the new IAM policy binding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Loss of access control restrictions**: Existing IAM conditions defined to restrict access to resources are effectively removed when a roleset is created or updated. This leads to broader access than intended.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Roleset Creation/Update:** An attacker (or a user with permissions to manage Vault rolesets) could inadvertently remove IAM conditions by creating or updating a roleset.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Vault Access**: An attacker would require the ability to create or modify rolesets within Vault. This typically means having the necessary Vault policies and permissions to manage the Google Cloud secrets engine.
