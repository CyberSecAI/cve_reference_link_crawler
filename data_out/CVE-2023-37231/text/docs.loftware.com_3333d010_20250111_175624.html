# Loftware Spectrum 4.6 HF14

July 2023

## Summary

This hotfix includes important security updates for Spectrum 4.6.

This hotfix also includes the following hotfixes:

* Added the submitXmlJob REST API method which can be used to send a print job with an XML body data to Spectrum. See [submitXmlJob](https://docs.loftware.com/spectrum-rest/Content/Integration/WebServices/REST_API/submitXmlJob.htm) in the *REST API for Web Services Integration Guide* for details on the use of this method (Spectrum 4.6 HF2).
* Resolved an issue where SAP BC-XOM jobs would error with a "Service Unavailable" message (Spectrum 4.6 HF4).
* Resolved an issue where the
  Service Proxy created a session for every call instead of reusing the sessions (Spectrum 4.6 HF4).
* Resolved an issue where a format source was applied incorrectly to a Formula Data Source (Spectrum 4.6 HF8).
* Resolved an issue that was causing the installation of an additional server in a distributed services environment with thousands of printers to take hours to complete (Spectrum 4.6 HF10).
* Resolved an issue when adding a new Oracle integration in Spectrum where the JAVA system was not getting loaded into Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) (Spectrum 4.6 HF12).

  **Important:** On a cloned database where the schema for the Oracle integration already exists, you must delete and recreate the schema used by the Oracle integration before creating a new Oracle integration in Spectrum.
* Resolved an issue where the Tomcat maximum thread utilization was being reached (Spectrum 4.6 HF13).

Additionally, this hotfix includes the following hotfixes for the Loftware Print Agent (LPA):

* Added the ability to sync Remote Sites from headquarters to facilities in a multi-site deployment of Spectrum, as well as create Remote Sites at facilities. In addition, all facilities, devices, data services, and integrations that are newly synced to a facility in a distributed services environment will now be automatically started on all Spectrum Application Servers (Spectrum 4.6 FP6).
* Resolved an issue when using the LPA to connect to a Spectrum instance running in Azure where an unexpected cookie format was preventing a successful connection (Spectrum 4.6 HF1).
* Resolved an issue where the **Connect** button was disabled when proxy information was required during LPA initial connection setup (Spectrum 4.6 HF3).
* Resolved an issue with the reconnection logic of the LPA. When the websocket connection is lost, LPA will now successfully reconnect with Spectrum and a restart will no longer be required (Spectrum 4.6 HF5).
* Added the ability to bypass a connection status check between the LPA and Spectrum, which helps reduce printing delays in high-latency networks. A new system property allows you to set a validation window, and connection status messages are skipped if the connection has been verified within the window (Spectrum 4.6 HF7).

## Prerequisites

Loftware Spectrum 4.6 must be installed prior to applying this hotfix.

## Post Installation

1. After installing the hotfix, you can remove any temporary folders you created during the installation process.
2. To finish applying the hotfixes, sign in to Spectrum on the initial Spectrum Application Server as SuperAdmin and add the following system properties in **System** > **System Properties**.
   1. To set a validation window for the LPA (Spectrum 4.6 HF7), add:
      * Namespace: lpa
      * Key: connection.status.validation.window.ms
      * Value: Time in miliseconds between 0 and 60,000
   2. To resolve the Tomcat maximum thread utilization issue (Spectrum 4.6 HF13), add:
      * Namespace: DocManagement
      * Key: disableSerializedDocumentImport
      * Value: true

   For more information, see [View and Update System Properties](https://docs.loftware.com/spectrum_4.6/Content/SystemMgt/Global/TskSystemProp.htm "Loftware Spectrum User Guide (Help)") in the Spectrum User Guide (Help).
3. Restart the Loftware Spectrum service on the initial Spectrum Application Server.
4. Sign in to Spectrum and perform the following steps to upgrade your Remote Sites with the latest LPA:
   1. Go to **Devices** and open the Remote Site to upgrade.
   2. Click **Upgrade**.
      When the process is complete, the installer automatically
      closes.
   3. Confirm that the updated Remote Site is connected by clicking the Loftware
      icon in the system tray.
   4. Repeat steps a-c for each Remote Site.

**Note:** In a multi-site deployment of Spectrum Cloud using load balancing, the transactional sync from a facility to headquarters may abort with the following error:
`java.io.IOException: Connection remotely closed`
If this occurs, shutdown any additional facility servers and try the transactional sync again.
