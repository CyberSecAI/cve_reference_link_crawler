{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The rehash delayed work in the Mellanox Spectrum ACL TCAM driver migrates filters between regions. If the migration fails, a rollback is attempted, which can also fail. This can cause a backup chunk to be overwritten and leaked due to incorrect assumptions about the backup chunk's state during a rollback of a rollback.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory leak due to improper handling of backup chunks during migration rollback.",
    "Lack of verification that a backup chunk is NULL before overwriting it.",
    "Incorrect assumption that a backup chunk doesn't exist if the current chunk doesn't reference the target region."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory leak, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the rehash process when migrating filters between regions. An attacker would need to trigger this rehash operation and cause it to fail, then cause the rollback to also fail, in order to trigger the memory leak",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the rehash of the ACL TCAM filters, as well as cause migration and rollback to fail, likely requiring control over network configurations or filter updates."
