Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-17558:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded administrator account (`manufacture:erutcafunam`) present in the web server configuration. This account cannot be modified or deleted by the camera's owner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The `manufacture:erutcafunam` credentials provide a backdoor into the system, bypassing any user-set passwords.
*   **OS Command Injection:** Endpoints within the `/cgi-bin/mft` directory, accessible via the hardcoded credentials, are vulnerable to OS command injection. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control over the camera by exploiting the hardcoded credentials and OS command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive information, including user-configured credentials, can be extracted by exploiting the vulnerabilities, allowing further access to internal networks or services.
*   **Malware Deployment:** The ability to execute arbitrary code enables attackers to install malware or other malicious software on the compromised device.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised cameras can be used as a pivot point to attack other devices on the same network.
*   **Denial of Service:** The camera can be completely disabled or rendered unusable.
*  **Tampering with evidence:** In security-critical scenarios, criminal acts recorded by the camera could be tampered with or deleted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attack can be carried out remotely via the network, as long as the device is reachable.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the web interface of the camera.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The hardcoded credentials bypass standard authentication mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network connectivity:** The attacker must be on the same network or have network access to the camera.
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera's web interface.
*   **No prior knowledge of user-set credentials is required:** The hardcoded credentials bypass standard authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The hardcoded `manufacture` account is associated with the `/cgi-bin/mft` directory, which is used to change the WiFi settings of the device.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to use the hardcoded credentials to copy user-managed credentials to a publicly accessible location, and then clean up this file after being used.
*   The vulnerability is considered highly critical due to its ease of exploitation and the high impact of a successful attack.

This is consistent with the official description provided by the CVE.
