Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `json-markup` library, used by Jaeger UI, does not properly sanitize keys in JSON objects. This allows for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code within the keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS because the malicious payload is embedded within the trace data and executed when a user views the trace details in the Jaeger UI.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `json-markup` library fails to sanitize the keys of JSON objects before rendering them as HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when viewing the affected trace details.
- **Unauthorized Jaeger Queries:** Using the injected JavaScript, an attacker could potentially make unauthorized queries to the Jaeger API and exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Trace data manipulation:** The attacker injects the malicious payload within the 'key' part of a key-value pair (in a tag/logs/process) of a trace.
- **User interaction:** The XSS is triggered when a user views the trace details and the component renders the malicious key-value pair.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Control over trace data:** The attacker must be able to create or manipulate trace data that is ingested by the Jaeger backend and displayed by the Jaeger UI. This could be achieved by directly sending malicious traces or by compromising a service that generates the traces.
- **User interaction:** A user needs to view the trace details containing the malicious payload in order to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `KeyValuesTable.tsx` component of Jaeger UI, specifically where it uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with data processed by the vulnerable `json-markup` library.
- The `json-markup` library was patched by escaping keys, parsing URLs and using safe href property, removing date handling, and removing skinning ability in commit `b59d8e3b5e444c40578c6cc2da911620f0d94eca`.
- Jaeger UI addressed the vulnerability by copying and fixing the `json-markup` functionality, as seen in PR #1498.
- CVSS v3 base metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
