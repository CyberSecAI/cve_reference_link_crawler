### @yurishkuro **[yurishkuro](/yurishkuro)** commented [Jun 13, 2023](#issue-1755352835) • edited Loading

The json-markup library does not properly escape the keys. Not clear if it is maintained or not, last changes were several years ago. Since it's just a single file, copy it directly and fix in place:

* escape keys
* parse URL and use safe href property in `<a href="...">`
* remove handling of `date` type which will never be in the JSON that we obtain from span tags via JSON.parse()
* remove skinning ability since we explicitly define css

Add tests:

* use Jest snapshot to validate that the JSON is escaped correctly, which was not tested by the previous code
* use more complex JSON with different unsafe values and exercising all code paths of the ported code

Sorry, something went wrong.
