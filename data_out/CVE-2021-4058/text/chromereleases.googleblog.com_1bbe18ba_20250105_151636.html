As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[1276568](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1276568)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).
