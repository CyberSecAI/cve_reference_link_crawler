    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-31798",
      "root_cause": "Exposed UART port transmits Wi-Fi credentials in clear text during boot process.",

        "Clear text transmission of sensitive data (Wi-Fi credentials) via UART.",
        "Lack of authentication or access control on the UART port."

          "Insecure bootloader configuration allowing modification of boot arguments.",
          "Lack of proper authentication for accessing the interactive shell."

          "Physical access to the device is required to gain access to the root shell (through CVE-2024-31799) and obtain the password hash.  Then physical access to other devices to use the cracked password via UART."
