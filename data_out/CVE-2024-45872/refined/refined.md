The provided content details three distinct vulnerabilities in BandiView v7.05, each triggered by malformed image files.

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of crafted JXR files. Specifically, when the program encounters a file with unsupported content, it fails to handle the input, leading to an error during a write operation.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation during file parsing.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The program crashes, becoming unresponsive.
*   **Attack vector:** Loading a specially crafted JXR file.
*   **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JXR file and deliver it to the victim, for example by disguising it with other image file extensions.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root cause:**  Insufficient verification of PSD files, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper bounds checking during PSD file parsing.
*   **Impact:** Buffer overflow, leading to potential crashes or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*  **Attack vector:** Loading a specially crafted PSD file.
*   **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PSD file and deliver it to the victim.

**Vulnerability 3**

*   **Root cause:** Insufficient verification of PSD files, leading to an access violation during a write operation.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization during PSD file parsing.
*  **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The program crashes, becoming unresponsive.
*   **Attack vector:** Loading a specially crafted PSD file.
*   **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PSD file and deliver it to the victim, for example by disguising it with other image file extensions.

The report emphasizes that all three vulnerabilities can be triggered by disguising malicious files with common image extensions (.jpg, .png, .psd), enticing users to open them with BandiView, which will cause the program to crash and deny access to the user. It also suggests strengthening exception handling in the image loading functions as a mitigation.
