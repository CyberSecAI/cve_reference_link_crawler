- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The password reset component uses the hostname supplied in the request's Host header when generating a password reset URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Host header injection vulnerability (CWE-20),  Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password (CWE-640).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can manipulate the password reset URL sent to users, redirecting them to an attacker-controlled server. This allows the attacker to capture the password reset token when a user clicks on the malicious link, potentially leading to account takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a manipulated Host header to the PILOS application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the PILOS application and manipulate the `Host` header. The password reset option must be enabled on the system. Additionally, the attack is limited to local user accounts.
