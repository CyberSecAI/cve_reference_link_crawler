- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication in the `GetAssignmentsDue` method of IDAttend's IDWeb application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of authentication for the `GetAssignmentsDue` method.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can extract sensitive student and teacher data.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a request to the vulnerable `GetAssignmentsDue` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required, meaning any attacker with network access to the application can exploit it.
