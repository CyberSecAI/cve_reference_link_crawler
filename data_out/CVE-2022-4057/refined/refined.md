- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin stores exported settings and logs in easily guessable paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive data disclosure due to predictable file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of potentially sensitive plugin settings and logs.
- **Attack vectors:** Direct access to predictable file paths via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication or special privileges are required; the attacker only needs to know the predictable path.
