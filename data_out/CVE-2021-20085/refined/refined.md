Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-20085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `_setParamValue` function of the `backbone-query-parameters` library. This function recursively sets values in a data object based on keys extracted from the query string. The key splitting logic using the `.` character and the way the nested objects are created allows for prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The `_setParamValue` function uses a loop to traverse the parts of the key and create nested objects. If a key like `__proto__.test` or `constructor.prototype.test` is passed via the query string, it allows modification of the prototype of base JavaScript objects.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There is no input validation or sanitization of the query string parameters that could prevent the modification of the prototype objects using special keys like `__proto__` or `constructor`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying the prototypes of base objects, an attacker could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the application that may lead to a DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application logic relies on specific prototype properties, an attacker could inject malicious code into those properties using the vulnerability and potentially execute arbitrary code.
*   **Bypass Security Mechanisms:**  By modifying the prototype objects an attacker may bypass security checks or introduce new security vulnerabilities in the web application that relies on the library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Query String Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the query string of a URL. An attacker could craft a URL with malicious query parameters, which will be parsed by the vulnerable `backbone-query-parameters` library.
    * Example: `?__proto__.test=test`
    * Example: `?constructor.prototype.test=test`
    * Example: `?__proto__.array=1|2|3`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control Query Parameters:** The attacker needs to be able to craft or influence the query string of URLs that are processed by the vulnerable application. This can be done by directly crafting the URL or by tricking a user to visit a malicious link.
*   **No Prior Authentication Needed:** The provided examples show that no prior authentication or user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
