  "CVE-2020-2601": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Use of unsafe RSA-MD5 checksum in Kerberos TGS requests within OpenJDK",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The usage of the MD5 algorithm for checksum generation in Kerberos TGS requests is considered unsafe",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially use this flaw to obtain sensitive information. Other documents also indicate it could lead to incorrect implementation of Kerberos GSSAPI and TGS requests or to incorrect TLS handshakes.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based, specifically targeting the handling of Kerberos TGS requests. Some advisories mention network access via Kerberos.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated remote attacker with network access."
