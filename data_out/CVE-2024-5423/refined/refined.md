- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of limitation on the number of inline diffs processed by the `InlineDiffFilter` in GitLab's markdown rendering pipeline (`banzai`). This allows an attacker to craft a payload with a large number of code diffs, leading to excessive CPU consumption during rendering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of input validation or rate limiting for inline diffs in markdown rendering.
    - The `InlineDiffFilter` does not have a limit like the `EmojiFilter` does.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): By sending a crafted payload with a large number of code diffs, an attacker can cause high CPU usage, making the GitLab instance unresponsive or inaccessible.
    - Server resource exhaustion: The attack leads to excessive CPU consumption, potentially impacting other services running on the same server.
    - Slowdowns and delays: Users may experience significant delays and slowdowns while navigating the GitLab instance.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious user can create a comment or markdown field containing a crafted payload with a large number of inline diffs (`{++}\n`).
    - The attack vector is through a POST request to the `preview_markdown` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be authenticated to make requests to the preview markdown endpoint.
    - Knowledge of CSRF token and session cookie: The attacker needs to have the user's session cookie and CSRF token in order to make a request.
