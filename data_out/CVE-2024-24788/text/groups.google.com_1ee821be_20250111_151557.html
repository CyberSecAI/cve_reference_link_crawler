Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.22.3 and 1.21.10, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* cmd/go: arbitrary code execution during build on darwin

  On Darwin, building a Go module which contains CGO can trigger arbitrary code execution when using the Apple version of ld, due to usage of the -lto\_library flag in a "#cgo LDFLAGS" directive.

  Thanks to Juho Forsén of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-24787 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/67119>.
* net: malformed DNS message can cause infinite loop

  A malformed DNS message in response to a query can cause the Lookup functions to get stuck in an infinite loop.

  Thanks to @long-name-let-people-remember-you on GitHub for reporting this issue, and to Mateusz Poliwczak for bringing the issue to our attention.

  This is CVE-2024-24788 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/66754>.

View the release notes for more information:
<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.3>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:
<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
git checkout go1.22.3 and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
David, Cherry, and Roland for the Go team
