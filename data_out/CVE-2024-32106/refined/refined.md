- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WP Compress â€“ Image Optimizer [All-In-One] plugin <= 6.10.35 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could lead to unintended actions being performed on the website by an authenticated user, potentially resulting in unauthorized changes, data manipulation, or other harmful consequences.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in user into making an unwanted request to the vulnerable plugin through a malicious link or website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into interacting with a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target website. The user must have a higher level of privileges.
