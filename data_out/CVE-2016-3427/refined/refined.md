Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3427:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Unrestricted deserialization of authentication credentials within the Java Management Extensions (JMX) component of OpenJDK.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The RMI server implementation in the JMX component of OpenJDK does not properly restrict the classes that can be deserialized when processing authentication credentials. This allows an attacker to provide arbitrary classes for deserialization.
*   Improper handling of serialized data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker able to connect to a JMX port could exploit this flaw.
*   Successful exploitation may lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application can be affected.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote exploitation via network access to a JMX port.
*   Maliciously crafted serialized data sent to the JMX port, taking advantage of unrestricted deserialization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Network connectivity to a vulnerable system's JMX port.
*   Ability to send a malicious serialized object to the vulnerable JMX port.
*   No authentication is required for the initial connection to the vulnerable JMX port to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from analyzed content:**
* The vulnerability is present in Oracle Java SE versions 6u113, 7u99, and 8u77.
* The vulnerability is addressed in IBM Java SE 7, and 8.
* It affects various SUSE, and Red Hat products such as java-1.6.0-openjdk, java-1.7.0-openjdk, and java-1.8.0-openjdk.
* The patch updates not only address the identified CVE, but also address several related CVEs which highlights the complexity of patching the affected code.
