Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the AudimexEE v.15.0 application. This lack of input validation allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the application's output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present within the application. These vulnerabilities stem from the application's failure to properly encode or sanitize user inputs. Specifically, the following parameters were found to be vulnerable:
    - `filter_kai_kai_tenant_shortcut`
    - `filter_kai_kai_au_process_code`
    - `filter_kai_kai_au_risk_code`
    - `filter_kai_kai_ra_impact`
    - `filter_kai_kai_date_ref`
    - `filter_kai_kai_traffic_light_rating`
    - `filter_kai_detail_kai_detail_kai_code`
    - `filter_kai_detail_kai_detail_kai_name`
    - `filter_kai_detail_kai_detail_tenant_shortcut`
    - `filter_kai_detail_kai_detail_au_process_code`
    - `filter_kai_detail_kai_detail_au_risk_code`
    - `filter_kai_detail_kai_detail_ra_impact`
    - `filter_kai_detail_kai_detail_kai_value_type`
    - `filter_kai_detail_kai_detail_kai_comment`
    - `upload_kai_import`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts within the user's browser. This could lead to various impacts, including:
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal user session cookies and impersonate the user.
- **Data Theft:** Sensitive data displayed or accessible within the application could be extracted.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could inject scripts to redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the displayed content of the application.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could create a phishing page that looks like a legitimate page in order to steal credentials

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameters:**  XSS can be injected via GET requests using the vulnerable parameters.
- **File Upload:** XSS can also be injected via file upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or files containing XSS payloads.
- The attacker needs to get a user to interact with the malicious URL or file (e.g., by clicking a link).
- The attacker needs to be able to authenticate as a normal user to access the vulnerable functionalities of the application.
