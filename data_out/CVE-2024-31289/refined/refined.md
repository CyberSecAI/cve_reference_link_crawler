- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Hello Elementor Theme <= 3.0.0 lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site by exploiting the missing CSRF protection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into performing an action (e.g., clicking a malicious link) that sends a forged request to the vulnerable site, without the user's awareness or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The victim needs to be a logged in user.
