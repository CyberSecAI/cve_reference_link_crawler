- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsanitized user-controlled input is directly passed to a SQL query in the "admin brand portal" feature of ScienceLogic SL1.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code which is then executed against the database, potentially leading to full compromise of the database, data exfiltration, or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based.
