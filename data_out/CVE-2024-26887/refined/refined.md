The provided content relates to a memory leak fix in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem, specifically within the `btusb` and `btmtk` drivers. This fix is associated with the commit `79f4127a502c5905f04da1f20a7bbe07103fb77c`, which is referenced in all the provided git logs.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurred in the `btusb_recv_acl_mtk` function within `drivers/bluetooth/btusb.c` when handling firmware dumps. The code would clone an sk_buff (socket buffer) for coredump processing using `skb_clone` but would not free this cloned buffer if `CONFIG_DEV_COREDUMP` was not enabled. Additionally, the `btmtk_process_coredump` function did not free the passed skb when `CONFIG_DEV_COREDUMP` was disabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Memory Leak:** Failure to free allocated memory (the cloned `sk_buff`) under specific conditions, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeated triggering of the memory leak could potentially lead to resource exhaustion, impacting the system's stability and performance.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Triggering Firmware Dumps:** Sending specific HCI ACL packets to a Mediatek Bluetooth device that would trigger a firmware dump. This is done via `btusb_recv_acl_mtk`. This condition is triggered when the handle is `0xfc6f`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Physical proximity:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable Bluetooth device, meaning the attacker needs to be within the bluetooth radio range of the victim.
-   **Bluetooth knowledge:** Ability to craft and send malicious HCI ACL packets.
- **Trigger coredump** The attacker needs to be able to cause the device to generate the coredump, thus triggering the vulnerabilty.
