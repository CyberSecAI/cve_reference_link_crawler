Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of file type validation in the `/admin/languages/install.php` file upload functionality. The system does not check if uploaded files have a PHP suffix, allowing attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unrestricted file upload leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The `install.php` script lacks proper file extension validation, leading to arbitrary PHP file uploads.
*  **Vulnerability Location**: `/admin/languages/install.php`
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the WBCE CMS application, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft or manipulation, and other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious PHP file (e.g., `hackshell.php`, `upgrade.php`).
    *   The attacker uses a POST request to the `/admin/languages/install.php` endpoint, uploading the crafted PHP file as part of a multipart/form-data request.
    *   The server processes this file without checking for the PHP extension and includes the file using the `require` function. This executes the attacker's PHP code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of WBCE CMS and be authenticated.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The code execution is temporary and not persistent as the file is removed after execution through the `unlink` function.
    *   The exploit can be triggered through a crafted POST request.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content includes:

*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** A detailed HTTP POST request with the necessary parameters to exploit the vulnerability is provided. This includes the `formtoken`, the uploaded file (`userfile`), and the `submit` parameter.
*   **Vulnerable Code Analysis:** The content points out the vulnerable lines of code within `/admin/languages/install.php`, specifically where the file is uploaded and included.
*   **Exploit Script:** A basic command for using a Python exploit script is provided.
*  **Affected Version**: WBCE CMS 1.6.1

This information provides sufficient detail to understand the vulnerability, its cause, and how to exploit it.
