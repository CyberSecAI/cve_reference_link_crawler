Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2024-29832:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `current_url` parameter within an AJAX call to the `GalleryBox` action in `admin-ajax.php` is not properly sanitized before being embedded into a JavaScript context within the response. This allows for the injection and execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability via the `current_url` parameter.
- Lack of input sanitization of the `current_url` parameter.
- The vulnerable parameter is embedded directly into JavaScript code, facilitating code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the user's browser.
- Potential for session hijacking, stealing authentication tokens, carrying out actions on behalf of the user, serving malware or displaying misleading information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted URL with embedded JavaScript within the `current_url` parameter.
- Attackers could use social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing) to trick users into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious URL.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability for CVE-2024-29832.
- Ability to convince users to click the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- Other parameters within the AJAX call (e.g., `image_id`) must be valid for the exploit to be successful.
- The vulnerability is located in the `admin-ajax.php` file, within the `GalleryBox` action.

This vulnerability was discovered by AppCheck and assigned CVE-2024-29832. The vendor was advised to upgrade to version 1.8.22 or later of the plugin to remediate this and other similar issues.
