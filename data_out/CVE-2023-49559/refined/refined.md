{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The gqlparser library used by the Gqlgen GraphQL server does not limit the number of directives in a GraphQL query, which allows for a large number of non-existing directives to be included.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of input validation/limitation on the number of directives.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "System resource exhaustion leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to increased processing time and response size.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted HTTP requests with GraphQL queries containing a large number of non-existing directives.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the GraphQL server."
