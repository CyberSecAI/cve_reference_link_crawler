|  |  |
|  | The gqlparser library usesd by the Gqlgen GraphQL server was found vulnerable to a directive overload that can cause system resource exhaustion. |
|  |  |
|  | Since is no limit on the amount of directives that can be given as input inside the GraphQL query in the HTTP requests, |
|  | adding a large amount of non-existing directives can increase significantly the processing time of the query and response size, hence sending similar requests with the payload at the same time can cause a DoS condition on the server. |
|  |  |
|  | The issue is in the parseDirectives function at: |
|  | https://github.com/vektah/gqlparser/blob/master/parser/query.go#L316 |
|  |  |
|  | Let's say that you have a valid GraphQL query" |
|  |  |
|  | query { |
|  | user { |
|  | name |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | modify it so it will have many non-existing directives, e.g.: |
|  |  |
|  | query { |
|  | user @aa @aa @aa ... { |
|  | name |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | Replace "..." with as many @aa as you need. The more you add, the larger the response size and time processed. |
|  |  |
|  | A temporary fix in version 2.5.13 of gqlparser is to limit the number of tokens in a request to 15,000: |
|  | https://github.com/vektah/gqlparser/releases/tag/v2.5.13 |
|  |  |
|  | It is configured by the usesr in version v2.5.15 and above. |
|  |  |
|  | The fix was merged in Gqlgen v0.17.49. |
