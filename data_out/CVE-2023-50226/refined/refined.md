Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Parallels Desktop Updater service. It stems from the ability to manipulate symbolic links, which an attacker can leverage to move arbitrary files on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** The Updater service incorrectly handles symbolic links, allowing an attacker to create a link that points to a location outside of the intended directory.
- **Arbitrary File Move:** By manipulating the symbolic links, an attacker can trick the Updater service into moving files to unintended locations.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to move arbitrary files, combined with the Updater service running with elevated privileges, enables a local privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to root, leading to:
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute code with root privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** Complete control over the target system.
- **Data manipulation or exfiltration**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker must be able to create symbolic links.
- **Abuse of the Updater Service:** The attacker manipulates symbolic links so the Updater service moves arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires an existing low-privileged account on the target macOS system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create symbolic links.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on 2023-06-21 and a fix was released prior to the publication of this advisory on 2023-12-19.
