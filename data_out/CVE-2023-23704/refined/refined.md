{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Comments Ratings plugin <= 1.1.6 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in, higher-privileged user, executes unwanted actions within the WordPress Comments Ratings plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or performing some action that triggers the crafted request. Unauthenticated access is mentioned in the 'Required privilege' section, however, this likely refers to the attacker and not the victim user."
