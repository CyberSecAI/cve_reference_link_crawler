{
  "CVE-2024-32944": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of file paths during the installation of crafted UTAU voicebank installer files (.uar or .zip files).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal (CWE-22)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can place arbitrary files on the user's system by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability during the installation of a crafted UTAU voicebank.",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious .uar or .zip file that, when installed as a voicebank in UTAU, uses directory traversal sequences to write files to locations outside of the intended installation directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious UTAU voicebank installer file (.uar or .zip) and convince the user to install this crafted file via the UTAU software. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system."
