The provided content relates to CVE-2024-24293.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a prototype pollution issue in the `@bit/loader` npm package where the `merge` function is invoked unsafely. The function does not properly check if a provided argument contains a `__proto__` object, allowing an attacker to inject properties onto the Object prototype.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution vulnerability.
- Unsafe use of the `merge` function.
- Missing checks for `__proto__` properties when processing input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By injecting malicious properties onto the Object prototype, attackers can modify the behavior of the entire application, potentially leading to various security issues. In the provided PoC, it is demonstrated that an attacker can successfully add a `polluted` property to `__proto__`.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can supply a specially crafted JSON object containing a `__proto__` property. This malicious JSON object is then processed by vulnerable code in the `@bit/loader` package.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `merge` function in the `@bit/loader` package, specifically a JSON object containing the `__proto__` property.
