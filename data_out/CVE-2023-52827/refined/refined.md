The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52827.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ath12k_htt_pull_ppdu_stats` function within the ath12k driver. The function extracts the payload length (`len`) from an HTT message and the number of users (`ppdu_info->ppdu_stats.common.num_users`). These values are used to iterate and parse data. However, these extracted values are not validated, potentially leading to out-of-bounds reads if the values are unexpected due to errors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code does not validate the `len` before accessing `skb->data` , which can result in reading memory beyond the allocated buffer if len is too large. Similarly `ppdu_info->ppdu_stats.common.num_users` is not validated against the max allowed value, leading to out of bound access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could cause an out-of-bounds read. This can potentially lead to:
-   **System crash:** Reading from invalid memory locations can cause the system to crash.
-   **Information disclosure:** Reading from arbitrary memory locations can leak sensitive information.
-   **Potential code execution:** In some scenarios, an out-of-bounds read can be leveraged for code execution, but this is less likely with this specific vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTT message, specifically the `ath12k_htt_ppdu_stats_msg`. The attacker can potentially send a message with manipulated `len` and/or `num_users` to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to inject or manipulate HTT messages received by the ath12k driver. This typically involves being in the network range of a vulnerable Wi-Fi device and having the ability to interact with the wireless communication protocol (likely by controlling the access point or via a man-in-the-middle attack).

**Additional details:**
The fix involves adding checks to validate the extracted length against the size of the skb buffer and `num_users` against max allowed value. If the validation fails, the function will return an error (`-EINVAL`) and prevent the out-of-bounds read.
