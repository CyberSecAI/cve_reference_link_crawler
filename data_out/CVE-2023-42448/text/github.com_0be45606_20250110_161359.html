# Contestation period in head datum can be modified during Close transaction, allowing malicious participant to freely modify the contestation deadline

## Description

### Summary

The specification states that the contestation period in the datum of the UTxO at the head validator must stay unchanged as the state progresses from Open to Closed (Close transaction), but no such check appears to be performed in the `checkClose` function of the head validator.

This would allow a malicious participant to modify the contestation deadline of the head to either allow them to fanout the head without giving another participant the chance to contest, or prevent any participant from ever redistributing the funds locked in the head via a fan-out.

### Details

In the `checkClose` function in Head.hs, the contestation period in the Closed state datum in the outgoing UTxO at the head validator is not checked to be unchanged, allowing the participant closing the head to choose any contestation period they would like.

<https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs#L284-L296>

<https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs#L320-L323>

### PoC

Malicious participant creates Close transaction as normal but changes the contestation period field of the head output datum such that it does not match the contestation period specified in the `Head.Open` datum of the head UTxO being spent.

### Impact

A malicious participant can choose any contestation period they want in the head output `Head.Closed` datum when they build the Close transaction (in the `checkClose` function of the head validator), and this value is then used in the `checkContest` function of the head validator to update the `contestDeadline` in a contest transaction. In fact, it looks like `ContestationPeriod` is a wrapper around the Integer type so can even be set to a negative number (?) which would then shift the contest deadline backwards in time. This would allow a malicious participant to modify the contestation deadline of the head to either allow them to fanout the head without giving another participant the chance to contest, or prevent any participant from reclaiming the funds from the head via a fan-out.

The former scenario would like like:

* malicious participant progresses the head from Open to Closed with a Close transaction, specifying some large negative number as the contestation period in the head output datum instead of keeping it unchanged (`malicious_cp`)
* the malicious participant submits a Contest transaction, in which the new contestation deadline `new_contest_deadline` is checked to equal `current_contest_deadline + malicious_cp`, but `malicious_cp` is a large negative number which means the contestation deadline will actually move backwards in time (to a point in time which has passed) instead of forwards
* the malicious participant can now immediately submit a fanout transaction without allowing other participants to contest their submitted snapshot, because the contest deadline has been set to a point in the past and so has already passed

The latter scenario is similar, but the malicious participant specifies a large positive number as the contestation period, which causes the contest deadline to be set unreachably far in the future in `checkContest`, and then no participant can cause a fanout because they can only do so once the deadline has been reached, but this deadline is unreachably far in the future.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
