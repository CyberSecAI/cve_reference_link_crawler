{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `checkClose` function in `Head.hs` does not verify that the contestation period in the Closed state datum of the outgoing UTxO remains unchanged from the Open state.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A missing check in the `checkClose` function allows modification of the contestation period.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious participant can manipulate the contestation period to either bypass the contestation phase or indefinitely delay head finalization.",
  "Attack vectors": "Modifying the contestation period field when creating a Close transaction.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious participant of the Hydra head who can create a Close transaction."
