**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that email addresses were not being hidden even when users had selected the "Hide Email Address" option in their account settings or during signup. This indicates a flaw in how the application handles the user's preference for email visibility.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Inconsistent handling of user preferences: The "Hide Email Address" setting was not consistently applied across the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Email address leak: User email addresses are exposed, potentially revealing personal information to other users. This could lead to privacy violations, targeted phishing attempts or spam.

**Attack vectors:**
- Viewing user profiles: By browsing user profiles, an attacker could view the email addresses of users who had intended to hide them.
