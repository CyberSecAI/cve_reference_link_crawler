```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises when the device receives a malformed APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The device is unable to properly handle a malformed APDU.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Upon processing the specially crafted packet, the BASRT-B router becomes unresponsive to all network requests, and its management interface crashes. Normal operation can only be restored through a manual power cycle.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a malformed APDU to the device.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the device, specifically crafted malformed APDUs."
