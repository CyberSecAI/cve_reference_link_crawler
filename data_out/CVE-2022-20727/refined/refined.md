{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation when loading Cisco IOx applications.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient validation of input when loading IOx applications allows modification of application content.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain privileges equivalent to the *root* user.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated, local attacker must be able to modify application content while a Cisco IOx application is loading."
