- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the redirect URL provided by the user. The application's validation logic could be bypassed by encoding whitespace characters in the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary, potentially malicious sites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is an inadequate input validation, specifically related to the handling of HTML encoded whitespace characters in the redirect URL. The vulnerable code checks if the redirect starts with a forward slash but fails to account for encoded whitespace that can be used to bypass the redirect validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect authenticated users to an arbitrary URL. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, such as phishing attacks, credential theft, or malware distribution by redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted redirect URL that includes HTML encoded whitespace characters. The attacker modifies the redirect URL parameter within the application's authentication flow to include characters such as `%0a`, `%0b`, `%09`, and `%0d`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to manipulate or provide the redirect URL during the authentication flow. This typically means they are able to initiate the authentication process or intercept a legitimate user's request and modify the redirect parameter.
