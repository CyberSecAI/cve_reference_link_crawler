The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41945.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of URL inputs, which are directly incorporated into command execution strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized URL input being concatenated into shell commands.
- The application uses `cmd.exe` on Windows and `/bin/bash` on Linux, which directly executes the crafted command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system.
- High impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as a successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, and disrupt system resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local: The attacker must have local access to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs high privileges to interact with the vulnerable component.
- User interaction is required, likely involving interaction with the application to trigger the vulnerable functionality.
