Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities affecting Westermo EDW-100 devices:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **Hardcoded Root Password:** The device has a hidden root user account with a hardcoded password embedded within the firmware ("image.bin"). This password cannot be changed by the user.
2.  **Insecure Configuration Storage:** The device's configuration file, which includes usernames and passwords, can be downloaded via an unauthenticated GET request, and these credentials are stored in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password:** The root user has a static, unchangeable password that is easily extracted from the firmware image.
2.  **CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password:** Both the hardcoded root password in the firmware and user passwords in the configuration file are stored in plaintext.
3.  **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** The configuration file containing credentials can be accessed without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain root access to the device using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Configuration Exposure:** Attackers can obtain device configuration details, including user credentials, through the unauthenticated download.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access and access to user credentials, an attacker could fully compromise the device, potentially disrupting network communications and impacting attached serial devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Firmware Analysis:** An attacker can extract the hardcoded password from the firmware image ("image.bin").
2.  **Unauthenticated Network Request:** An attacker can retrieve the configuration file via an unauthenticated GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device to make the GET request for the configuration or to exploit the root access.
*   **Firmware Access (for hardcoded password):** The attacker would need the device firmware (image.bin) to extract the hardcoded root password. This may or may not be available publicly.

The provided document offers more detail than a typical CVE description, providing specifics on how to extract the hardcoded password, access the configuration file, and the lack of ability to change the root password.
