- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Prenotazioni plugin (versions <= 1.7.4) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:**  Malicious scripts are injected into the website, likely through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the website. The required privilege is stated as "Administrator", which may indicate that the vulnerability is exploitable through admin-level interfaces, or that an administrator needs to make changes that allow the malicious script to be injected.
