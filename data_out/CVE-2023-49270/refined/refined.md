{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML response. Specifically, the `adults`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, and `children` parameters from the `reservation.php` resource are directly embedded into the HTML document within the value attribute of input tags, without any encoding or sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's page. When a user visits the crafted URL, the injected script will execute in the user's browser in the context of the vulnerable website, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, modify the content of the page, or perform actions on behalf of the user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in one or more of the vulnerable parameters (`adults`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, or `children`) and tricks a victim into visiting the link."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code and convince a user to click on it. The user must be authenticated to access the vulnerable page `reservation.php`.",
    "more_info": "The vulnerability is located in the `reservation.php` resource where the values of the GET parameters check_in_date, check_out_date, children and adults are echoed directly into HTML input fields. \nThere is no patch available for this vulnerability. The vendor page is <https://www.kashipara.com/>"
