Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-47202

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `of_thermal_*` functions within the Linux kernel's thermal management subsystem. Specifically, these functions were not properly checking if the `data->ops` pointer and its function pointers were valid before dereferencing them. This can occur when a thermal zone is configured to use a thermal sensor that hasn't been probed yet, resulting in `data->ops` being NULL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `of_thermal_get_temp`, `of_thermal_set_emul_temp`, `of_thermal_get_trend`, and `of_thermal_set_trip_temp` functions. These functions access function pointers through `data->ops` without ensuring `data->ops` and its function pointers are not NULL.
- **Missing checks:** The code lacked proper checks to ensure that the thermal zone's associated thermal sensor device had been properly initialized before accessing its operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** Attempting to set the trip point temperature via sysfs (`echo 120000 > trip_point_0_temp`) for a thermal zone whose sensor hasn't probed will result in a kernel crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This can lead to a denial of service.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the immediate impact is a crash, a NULL pointer dereference can sometimes be leveraged for more sophisticated exploits, though the provided context doesn't offer details on how that could be achieved in this case.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by writing to sysfs files related to thermal zones, which requires local access to the system.
- **Specific Configuration:** The vulnerability occurs when a thermal zone depends on a sensor that hasn't been initialized. The specific attack requires a configuration where the sensor probe is delayed compared to thermal zone initialization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker must be able to write to the sysfs interface, typically requiring root or elevated privileges.
- The attacker needs knowledge of system's device tree or thermal zones configuration to determine which zones are affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding checks in the `of_thermal_*` functions to ensure that `data->ops` and the function pointers within it are valid before dereferencing them.
- The provided git diffs show the added checks (`if (!data->ops || !data->ops-><function>`) in the relevant functions.

In summary, this vulnerability is a classic NULL pointer dereference caused by insufficient error checking. The fix is straightforward but critical to prevent kernel crashes when dealing with thermal sensors.
