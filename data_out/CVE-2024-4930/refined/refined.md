Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the insecure handling of user-supplied input within the `$_GET['id']` parameter. The application directly concatenates this parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** With sufficient privileges, an attacker could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Database takeover:** An attacker may be able to gain full control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` file.
- **Manipulated 'id' Parameter:** The attack vector specifically involves manipulating the `id` parameter within the GET request URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication or prior access to the system.

**Detailed Explanation from Content:**
- The GitHub content provides a specific vulnerable URL route `/simple-online-bidding-system/index.php?page=view_prod&id=1`.
- The content also provides sample exploit payloads, such as:
    - `page=view_prod&id=-2+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9%23` (to test the number of columns)
    - `page=view_prod&id=-2+union+select+1,2,database(),user(),5,6,7,8,9%23` (to extract the database name and current user)
- The vuldb.com content confirms the SQL injection vulnerability and provides a link to the GitHub page with more details.

The information provided in the content provides more details than a typical CVE description which often just states that an SQL injection exists without explicit details.
