This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix TensorKey hash function.

```
The original hash function only used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`).
It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`.  This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer.  We couldn't use this byte vector anyways, since types like `tstring` include pointers, whereas we need to hash the string values themselves.

Modified the hash function to more closely mirror the `==` operator.  This correctly handles `tstring` and any numeric types that do have contiguous storage.  Other types are currently left as unimplemented.
