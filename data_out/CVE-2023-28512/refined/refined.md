- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within IBM Watson CloudPak for Data Data Stores. This allows an attacker to manipulate data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with specific knowledge about the system can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not explicitly stated, but it involves an attacker leveraging specific system knowledge to interact with the vulnerable data stores and manipulate data via improper input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs specific knowledge about the system to exploit this vulnerability.
