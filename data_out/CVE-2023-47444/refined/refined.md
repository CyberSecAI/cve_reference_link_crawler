Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is improper sanitization of user-controlled input within the `storage()` and `admin()` functions in `upload/admin/controller/common/security.php`. Specifically, the `$name` and `$path` parameters from GET requests are not properly sanitized before being used to construct paths in config files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Static Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is static code injection in PHP files (`config.php` and `admin/config.php`). The vulnerable code constructs paths using user-supplied data, and this path is then written into the config files without proper escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into the config files.
  - The regular expressions used for sanitization are ineffective, as demonstrated by the provided example.
  - The use of `basename()` prevents the use of `/` character in the name.
  - A path traversal vulnerability exists in the storage function that allows attacker to specify paths outside the installation directory.
- The two vulnerabilities are located in the functions:
  - `common/security.storage`
  - `common/security.admin`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting arbitrary PHP code into the config files, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. The injected code will be executed every time the config files are included.
- **Application Disruption:** Due to the nature of the vulnerabilities, the application can be completely disrupted if the configuration files and directories do not match after the exploitation, as the injected paths and actual directories created on disk might not be the same.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by crafting specific GET requests to `common/security.storage` or `common/security.admin` with malicious `name` and/or `path` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Backend User:** The attacker needs valid credentials for the OpenCart backend dashboard.
- **`common/security` Privileges:** The authenticated user must have both "access" and "modify" permissions for the `common/security` route.
- **`admin()` Pre-requisite**: For the `admin()` function, the `admin` folder must not be renamed yet.
- **Knowledge of Installation Path:** For the `storage` function, the attacker must know or be able to infer the OpenCart installation path in order to bypass the initial path checks. This can be achieved through several ways described in the content.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerabilities were introduced from OpenCart version 4.0.0.0 onwards.
- The `storage` vulnerability can be exploited even if the `storage` folder has already been moved, while `admin` can only be exploited before renaming the `admin` folder.
- The CVSS 3.1 score is 8.8 (High) with vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
- The provided content includes a detailed Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for both vulnerabilities, demonstrating how to inject PHP code and achieve RCE.
- A mitigation was provided in form of a pull request fixing the regular expressions and a partial fix was merged on 16/11/2023 affecting only the `storage` function.

This information aligns with the provided CVE description, which states that authenticated users with `common/security` privileges can write arbitrary data to the `config.php` files.
