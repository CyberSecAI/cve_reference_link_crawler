- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists due to the web console directly serving URLs that contain whitelisted keywords in the path without requiring authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass. The vulnerability allows access to protected resources without authentication by including whitelisted keywords in the URL path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can access sensitive information, including the administrative password, potentially leading to further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker with access to the web console (either locally or remotely) can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a web request that includes a whitelisted keyword in the path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the web console, either locally or remotely. They do not need to be authenticated.
