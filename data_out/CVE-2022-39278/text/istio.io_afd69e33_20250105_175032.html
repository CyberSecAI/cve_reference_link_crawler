## Changes

* **Fixed** an issue that the default `idleTimeout` for the passthrough cluster was changed to `0s` in 1.14.0, disabling the timeout. Restored the previous behavior to using Envoy’s default value of 1 hour. ([Issue #41114](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/41114))
* **Fixed** the gateway API integration to not fail when the `v1alpha2` version is removed.
* **Fixed** handling of deprecated autoscaling settings. ([Issue #41011](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/41011))
