## Security update

* Patch for [CVE-2022-41715](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/55949). Replaces all uses of `stdlib` `regexp` with the Go 1.19.2 `stdlib` implementation. This will guard against DOS via malformed regular expressions.

## Changes

* **Fixed** an issue where the user can not delete the Istio Operator resource with revision if istiod is not running. ([Issue #40796](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/40796))
* **Fixed** a bug where the return dynamically generated by `jwks` was not base64 encoded, causing Envoy to fail to parse it.
* **Fixed** an issue where a root namespace `Sidecar` configuration would be ignored.
* **Fixed** the gateway API integration to not fail when the `v1alpha2` version is removed.
