## Changes

* **Fixed** some `ServiceEntry` host names can cause non-deterministic Envoy routes.
  ([Issue #38678](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/38678))
* **Fixed** `kube-inject` crashes when the pod annotation `proxy.istio.io/config` is set.
* **Fixed** an issue where the user can not delete the Istio Operator resource with revision if istiod is not running. ([Issue #40796](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/40796))
* **Fixed** an issue that the default `idleTimeout` for the passthrough cluster was changed to `0s` in 1.14.0, disabling the timeout. Restored the previous behavior to using Envoy’s default value of 1 hour. ([Issue #41114](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/41114))
* **Fixed** a bug where the return dynamically generated by `jwks` was not base64 encoded, causing Envoy to fail to parse it.
* **Fixed** an issue where adding a `ServiceEntry` could affect an existing `ServiceEntry` with the same host name.
  ([Issue #40166](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/40166))
* **Fixed** an issue where a root namespace `Sidecar` config would be ignored.
* **Fixed** the gateway API integration to not fail when the `v1alpha2` version is removed.
