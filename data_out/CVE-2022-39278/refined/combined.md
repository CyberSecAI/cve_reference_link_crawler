# Denial of service attack due to Golang Regex Library

High

[howardjohn](/howardjohn)
published
GHSA-86vr-4wcv-mm9w
Oct 12, 2022

## Package

docker

Istio
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

All Versions

## Patched versions

1.15.2, 1.14.5, 1.13.9

## Description

**Impact**

The Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker.

For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet.

**Patches**

1.15.2

1.14.5

1.13.9

**Workarounds**

There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in regexp.Compile in Go.

**References**

More details can be found in the [Istio Security Bulletin](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2022-003)
