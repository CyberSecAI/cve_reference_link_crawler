- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can cause the SQL server to sleep for an arbitrary amount of time, exfiltrate information, or leverage binary search algorithms.
- Attack vectors: The `level2` query parameter in the `../smartfactory/unit.php` endpoint.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker can send a crafted request with the `level2` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint.
