# Enterprise Server 3.5 release notes

## Enterprise Server 3.5.19

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.19](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.19/download)

June 20, 2023

ðŸ“£ This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.5.19: Security fixes](#3.5.19-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated Git to include fixes from [2.40.1](https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/).
* If a user's request to the instance's API included authentication credentials within a URL parameter, administrators could see the credentials in JSON within the instance's audit log.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.19: Bug fixes](#3.5.19-bugs)

* If an administrator updated the instance's TLS certificate using the Management Console API's [Set settings](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console) endpoint, sending the certificate and key data as a URL query parameter resulted in the data appearing unmasked in system logs.
* Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow.
### [3.5.19: Changes](#3.5.19-changes)

* If a configuration runs fails due to Elasticsearch errors, `ghe-config-apply` displays a more actionable error message.
### [3.5.19: Known issues](#3.5.19-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Hotpatch upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.6 may fail. Upgrades with the full `.pkg` are unaffected. If the upgrade fails for your instance, workaround this issue by connecting to the administrative shell (ssh) and running the following non-interactive command:

  ```
  echo "grub-pc grub-pc/install_devices_empty boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections

  ```

  If you're unable to upgrade, or if you need further assistance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-10-14]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-12-07]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
## Enterprise Server 3.5.18

### [3.5.18: Security fixes](#3.5.18-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.18: Bug fixes](#3.5.18-bugs)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when upgrading the MySQL master node, the post-upgrade configuration run would take 600 seconds longer than required due to incorrect detection of unhealthy nodes.
* If an instance has tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 can take longer than expected. To decrease the risk of a long-running upgrade, before upgrading, someone with administrative SSH access to the instance can run the `ghe-purge-deleted-repositories` script. **Warning**: You cannot restore a purged repository. Use the script with caution. For assistance using the script, contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket).
* If a user clicked the link to share feedback or report bugs for the beta of user lists, the web interface responded with a `404` error.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
### [3.5.18: Changes](#3.5.18-changes)

* People with administrative SSH access to an instance can configure the maximum memory usage in gigabytes for Redis using `ghe-config redis.max-memory-gb VALUE`.
### [3.5.18: Known issues](#3.5.18-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.

* **MEDIUM**: Updated Git to include fixes from 2.40.1. For more information, see [Git security vulnerabilities announced](https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/) on the GitHub Blog.
### [3.5.17: Bug fixes](#3.5.17-bugs)

* Users were unable to upload GIF files as attachments within a comment in an issue or pull request.
* A site administrator could not bypass a proxy for a top-level domain (TLD) from the instance's exception list or IANAs registered top-level domains (TLDs).
* On some platforms, after someone with administrative SSH access ran `ghe-diagnostics`, the command's output included a cosmetic `SG_IO` error.
* After restoration of a deleted organization, the organization did not appear in the instances list of organizations.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer to import data from GitHub Enterprise Cloud, migrations failed during the import of file-level comments. This failure no longer prevents the import from proceeding.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer, import of a repository failed if a project column in the repository contained 2,500 or more archived cards.
* The `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts were incorrectly set as `false` when branch protections did exist.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
### [3.5.17: Changes](#3.5.17-changes)

* People with administrative SSH access who generate a support bundle using the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utilities can specify the period of time to gather data with `-p` or `--period` without using spaces or quotes. For example, in addition to `'-p 5 days'` or `-p '4 days 10 hours'`, `-p 5days` or `-p 4days10hours` are valid.

* On an instance with audit log streaming enabled, the `driftwood` service does not start, preventing the normal operation of audit log streaming. [Updated: 2023-06-06]
## Enterprise Server 3.5.16

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.16](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.16/download)

April 18, 2023

* In some cases, graphs on the Management Console's monitor dashboard failed to render.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, issues in private and internal repositories were not included in users search results for GitHub.com.
### [3.5.16: Changes](#3.5.16-changes)

* To avoid a failure during a configuration run on a cluster, validation of `cluster.conf` with the `ghe-cluster-config-check` utility ensures that the `consul-datacenter` field for each node matches the top-level `primary-datacenter` field.
* If a site administrator provides an invalid configuration for blob storage for GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages on an instance, the preflight checks page displays details and troubleshooting information.
### [3.5.16: Known issues](#3.5.16-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.

## Enterprise Server 3.5.15

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.15](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.15/download)

March 23, 2023

ðŸ“£ This is not the [latest patch release](#3.5.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.5.15: Security fixes](#3.5.15-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Addressed an improper authentication vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to modify other users' secret gists by authenticating through an SSH certificate authority. This vulnerability was reported via theÂ [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/)Â and has been assignedÂ [CVE-2023-23761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23761). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
* **MEDIUM**: Addressed an incorrect comparison vulnerability that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. This vulnerability was reported via theÂ [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/)Â and has been assignedÂ [CVE-2023-23762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23762). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
### [3.5.15: Bug fixes](#3.5.15-bugs)

* In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance.
* After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear.
* GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard.
* After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`.
* During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations.
* When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported.
* If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file, pull requests in the repository intermittently failed to display the files validity or updated code owner information, requiring the user to reload the page.
* The CSV reports for all users and all active users, available from the site admin dashboard, did not consider recent access using SSH or personal access tokens.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, users would not see issues in private and internal repositories in search results for GitHub.com.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
### [3.5.15: Changes](#3.5.15-changes)

* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot updates, the instance creates the initial set of updates faster.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)."
* When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[Configuring an outbound web proxy server](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)."
* To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced.
* The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
### [3.5.15: Known issues](#3.5.15-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements.

## Enterprise Server 3.5.12

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.12](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.12/download)

February 02, 2023

ðŸ“£ This is not the [latest patch release](#3.5.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.5.12: Security fixes](#3.5.12-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: A code injection vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed setting arbitrary environment variables from a single environment variable value in GitHub Actions when using a Windows based runner due to improper sanitization of null bytes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need existing permission to control the value of environment variables for use with GitHub Actions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-22381](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22381).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.12: Bug fixes](#3.5.12-bugs)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object error` may have occurred for the Notebook and Viewscreen services.
* When enabling automatic TLS certificate management with Let's Encrypt, the process could fail with the error `The certificate is not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) or the certificate chain in missing intermediate CA signing certificates`.
### [3.5.12: Changes](#3.5.12-changes)

* When a timeout occurs during diff generation, such as when a commit displays an error that the diff is taking too long to generate, the `push` webhook event will deliver empty diff information. Previously, the `push` webhook event would fail to be delivered.
### [3.5.12: Known issues](#3.5.12-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Hotpatch upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.6 may fail. Upgrades with the full `.pkg` are unaffected. If the upgrade fails for your instance, workaround this issue by connecting to the administrative shell (ssh) and running the following non-interactive command:

  ```
  echo "grub-pc grub-pc/install_devices_empty boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections

### [3.5.10: Changes](#3.5.10-changes)

* The `ghe-support-bundle` and `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` commands were updated to include the `-p/--period` flag to generate a time constrained support bundle. The duration can be specified in days and hours, for example: `-p '2 hours'`, `-p '1 day'`, `-p '2 days 5 hours'`.
* The performance of configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` has been improved.
* When upgrading an instance with a new root partition, running the `ghe-upgrade` command with the `-t/--target` option ensures the preflight check for the minimum disk storage size is executed against the target partition.
* When exporting account data, backing up a repository, or performing a migration, the link to a repository archive now expires after 1 hour. Previously the archive link expired after 5 minutes.

### [3.5.9: Security fixes](#3.5.9-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed remote code execution when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46256](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-46256).
* **HIGH**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin access for a repository. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.0. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23741](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23741).
* **MEDIUM**: An information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed private repositories to be added to a GitHub Actions runner group via the API by a user who did not have access to those repositories, resulting in the repository names being shown in the UI. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to the GHES instance, permissions to modify GitHub Actions runner groups, and successfully guess the obfuscated ID of private repositories. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46257](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46257).
### [3.5.9: Bug fixes](#3.5.9-bugs)

* If a GitHub Actions dependency uses a pinned SHA version, Dependabot will no longer mark the dependency as vulnerable.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-sync-ca-certificates` command from an instances primary node via the administrative shell (SSH), the command only replicated CA certificates from the instances primary node to a single replica node. The command did not replicate the certificates to all available replica nodes.
* Installation of GitHub Enterprise Server on the VMware ESXi hypervisor failed due to the generation of an OVA file with an invalid capacity value.
* When users performed an operation using the API, GitHub Enterprise Server enforced repository size quotas even when disabled globally.
* The `member` webhook event did not include the `from` and `to` field values for the `permission` field as part of the `changes` field.
* After a user's account was deleted from the instance, image attachments that the user uploaded in comments were no longer visible in the web interface.
* In some cases, the page for setting up code scanning would erroneously report that GitHub Actions was not configured for the instance.
* If a user uploaded more than one file while creating a new Gist, the user could not delete any files uploaded after the first.
* A debug-level message appeared in a system log, which could consume space rapidly on the instance's root storage volume.
### [3.5.9: Known issues](#3.5.9-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

* **MEDIUM**: Updated GitHub Actions runners to fix a bug that allowed environment variables in GitHub Actions jobs to escape the context of the variable and modify the invocation of `docker` commands directly. For more information, see the [Actions Runner security advisory](https://github.com/actions/runner/security/advisories/GHSA-2c6m-6gqh-6qg3).
* **MEDIUM**: An improper privilege management vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed users with improper privileges to create or delete pages via the API. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be added to an organization's repo with write permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23737](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23737).
* **LOW**: Due to a CSRF vulnerability, a `GET` request to the instance's `site/toggle_site_admin_and_employee_status` endpoint could toggle a user's site administrator status unknowingly.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.7: Bug fixes](#3.5.7-bugs)

* After a site administrator made a change that triggered a configuration run, such as disabling GitHub Actions, validation of services would sometimes fail with the message `WARNING: Validation encountered a problem`.
* After a site administrator installed a hotpatch containing changes to web interface assets such as JavaScript files or images, the instance did not serve the new assets.
* When a user accessed a renamed repository using Git, the hostname in the Git output incorrectly indicated GitHub.com instead of the instance's hostname.
* On instances using LDAP authentication and LDAP sync, sync would fail and print `undefined method ord for nil:NilClass` in `ldap-sync.log`.
* Addressed a bug in which the endpoint for [creating a tag protection state for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/repos/tags#create-a-tag-protection-state-for-a-repository) was returning a 500 error.

* In some cases, on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, secret scanning alerts did not include a provider type, and instead indicated that the provider type was "unknown."
### [3.5.7: Changes](#3.5.7-changes)

* To ensure that site administrators can successfully complete an upgrade, the instance will now execute a preflight check to ensure that the virtual machine meets minimum hardware requirements. The check also verifies Elasticsearch's health. You can review the current requirements for CPU, memory, and storage for GitHub Enterprise Server in the "Minimum requirements" section within each article in "[Setting up a GitHub Enterprise Server instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."

### [3.5.6: Features](#3.5.6-features)

* Repository archives for migrations now include an `is_archived` field.
### [3.5.6: Security fixes](#3.5.6-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A GitHub App could use a scoped user-to-server token to bypass user authorization logic and escalate privileges.
* **MEDIUM**: The use of a Unicode right-to-left override character in the list of accessible files for a GitHub App could obscure additional files that the app could access.
* **LOW**: Granting a user the ability to bypass branch protections no longer allows the user to bypass the requirement for signature verification.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.6: Bug fixes](#3.5.6-bugs)

* Installation of a TLS certificate failed when the certificate's subject string included UTF-8 characters.
* Configuration runs could fail when `retry-limit` or `retry-sleep-duration` were manually set by an administrator using `ghe-config`.
* The `ghe-find-insecure-git-operations` command did not return all insecure Git operations after each invocation.
* In some cases, the Management Console's monitor dashboard would not load correctly.
* Removed a non-functional link for exporting Management Console monitor graphs as a PNG image.
* When sending a support bundle to GitHub Enterprise Support using `ghe-support-upload`, the `-t` option would not successfully associate the uploaded bundle with the specified ticket.
* In rare cases, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 to 3.4 would incorrectly modify how data is stored, resulting in failures during future upgrades. When upgrading directly to this release from 3.3, the failure will not occur.
* When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
* Git clones or fetches over SSH could experience data corruption for transfers over 1GB in size.
* A link back to the security settings for the instance's enterprise account could render an incorrect view.
* After a user deleted or restored packages from the web interface, counts for packages could render incorrectly.
* After successful configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would not send digest emails.
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5, releases would appear to be missing from repositories. This occurred when the required Elasticsearch index migrations had not successfully completed. The releases UI now indicates if it is waiting for the Elasticsearch index migrations to complete, and links to documentation on how to observe status and immediately complete the migration.
* Manually disabled GitHub Actions workflows in a repository were re-enabled if the repository received a push containing more than 2048 commits, or if the repository's default branch changed.
* When viewing a pull request's diff for a large file with many lines between changes, it was not possible to expand the view to display all of the changes.
* If branch protections were enabled, the `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts for GitHub Actions workflow runs were incorrectly set as `false`.
* On instances using GitHub Advanced Security, secret scanning automatically revoked personal access tokens added to public repositories.
* Repositories for packages erroneously displayed a "Used by" section.
### [3.5.6: Known issues](#3.5.6-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Hotpatch upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.6 may fail. Upgrades with the full `.pkg` are unaffected. If the upgrade fails for your instance, workaround this issue by connecting to the administrative shell (ssh) and running the following non-interactive command:

  ```
  echo "grub-pc grub-pc/install_devices_empty boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections

  ```

  If you're unable to upgrade, or if you need further assistance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-10-14]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.5](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.5/download)

August 30, 2022

ðŸ“£ This is not the [latest patch release](#3.5.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.5.5: Bug fixes](#3.5.5-bugs)

* After unlocking a repository for temporary access, a site administrator was unable to manage settings for security products in the repository.
* Duplicate administrative SSH keys could appear in both the Management Console and the `/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* The site admin page for individual users at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/stafftools/users/USERNAME/admin` contained functionality not intended for GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some cases, running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` could replicate an empty configuration to existing nodes in a cluster.
* In some cases, configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` did not complete, or returned a `Container count mismatch` error.
* After updating a self-signed TLS certificate on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, UI elements on some pages in the web interface did not appear.
* The site admin bar at the top of the web interface contained a broken link to the SHA for the currently running version of the application.
* In some cases, background tasks could stall due to a library that was used concurrently despite not being thread-safe.
* Alerts from secret scanning for GitHub Advanced Security customers were missing in the web UI and REST API if a site administrator did not upgrade directly to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. The alerts are now visible.
* When a user forked a repository into an organization, a long list of organizations would not render properly.
### [3.5.5: Changes](#3.5.5-changes)

* Generation of support bundles is faster as a result of parallelized log sanitization. For more information about support bundles, see "[Providing data to GitHub Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/providing-data-to-github-support)."
* APIs that contain the `organization` or `org` route now accept either the organization's slug or ID. Previously, the APIs only accepted slugs, which caused `Link` headers for GitHub Advanced Security endpoints to be inaccessible. For more information, see "[Organizations](https://docs.github.com/rest/orgs/orgs)" in the REST API documentation.
* The enterprise audit log now includes more user-generated events, such as `project.create`. The REST API also returns additional user-generated events, such as `repo.create`. For more information, see "[Accessing the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/accessing-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)" and "[Using the audit log API for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise#querying-the-audit-log-rest-api)."
* In some cases, cache replicas could reject some Git operations on recently updated repositories. For more information about repository caching, see "[About repository caching](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/about-repository-caching)."
### [3.5.5: Known issues](#3.5.5-known-issues)

### [3.5.4: Security fixes](#3.5.4-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL**: GitHub Enterprise Server's Elasticsearch container used a version of OpenJDK 8 that was vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. The vulnerability is tracked as [CVE-2022-34169](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9339-86wc-4qgf).
* **HIGH**: Previously installed apps on user accounts were automatically granted permission to access an organization on scoped access tokens after the user account was transformed into an organization account. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
### [3.5.4: Bug fixes](#3.5.4-bugs)

* In some cases, GitHub Enterprise Server instances on AWS that used the `r4.4xlarge` instance type would fail to boot.
* In some cases, UI elements within a pull request's **Files changed** tab could overlap.
* When a custom dormancy threshold was set for the instance, suspending all dormant users did not reliably respect the threshold. For more information about dormancy, see "[Managing dormant users](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-dormant-users)."
* When calculating committers for GitHub Advanced Security, it was not possible to specify individual repositories. For more information, see "[Site admin dashboard](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/site-admin-dashboard#advanced-security-committers)."
* In some cases, Elasticsearch's post-upgrade `es:upgrade` process could crash before completion.
* The script for migration to internal repositories failed to convert the visibility for public repositories to internal or private. For more information about the migration, see "[Migrating to internal repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/user-management/managing-repositories-in-your-enterprise/migrating-to-internal-repositories)."
* Detection of GitHub Actions workflow files for the dependency graph was unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3, but is now available in 3.5.4. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph#supported-package-ecosystems)."

We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 as you upgrade to the latest release. To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade).

  + To display the missing alerts for all repositories owned by an organization, organization owners can navigate to the organization's **Code security and analysis** settings, then click **Enable all** for secret scanning. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#enabling-or-disabling-a-feature-for-all-existing-repositories)."

### [3.5.2: Security fixes](#3.5.2-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Prevents an attack where an `org` query string parameter can be specified for a GitHub Enterprise Server URL that then gives access to another organization's active committers.
* **MEDIUM**: Ensures that `github.company.com` and `github-company.com` are not evaluated by internal services as identical hostnames, preventing a potential server-side security forgery (SSRF) attack.
* **LOW**: An attacker could access the Management Console with a path traversal attack via HTTP even if external firewall rules blocked HTTP access.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.2: Bug fixes](#3.5.2-bugs)

* Files inside an artifact archive were unable to be opened after decompression due to restrictive permissions.
* In some cases, packages pushed to the Container registry were not visible in GitHub Enterprise Server's web UI.
* Management Console would appear stuck on the *Starting* screen after upgrading an under-provisioned instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.
* Redis timeouts no longer halt database migrations while running `ghe-config-apply`.
* Background job processors would get stuck in a partially shut-down state, resulting in certain kinds of background jobs (like code scanning) appearing stuck.
* In some cases, site administrators were not automatically added as enterprise owners.
* Actions workflows calling other reusable workflows failed to run on a schedule.
* Resolving Actions using GitHub Connect failed briefly after changing repository visibility from public to internal.
### [3.5.2: Changes](#3.5.2-changes)

* Improved the performance of Dependabot Updates when first enabled.
* Increase maximum concurrent connections for Actions runners to support [the GHES performance target](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server#review-hardware-requirements).
* The GitHub Pages build and synchronization timeouts are now configurable in the Management Console.
* Added environment variable to configure Redis timeouts.
* Creating or updating check runs or check suites could return `500 Internal Server Error` if the value for certain fields, like the name, was too long.
* Improves performance in pull requests' "Files changed" tab when the diff includes many changes.
* The Actions repository cache usage policy no longer accepts a maximum value less than 1 for [`max_repo_cache_size_limit_in_gb`](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/actions/cache#set-github-actions-cache-usage-policy-for-an-enterprise).
* When [deploying cache-server nodes](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/configuring-a-repository-cache#configuring-a-repository-cache), it is now mandatory to describe the datacenter topology (using the `--datacenter` argument) for every node in the system. This requirement prevents situations where leaving datacenter membership set to "default" leads to workloads being inappropriately balanced across multiple datacenters.
* VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor version 7.0 is now supported. [Updated: 2022-09-07]
### [3.5.2: Known issues](#3.5.2-known-issues)

* Optimised the inclusion of metrics when generating a cluster support bundle.
* In HA configurations where Elasticsearch reported a valid yellow status, changes introduced in a previous fix would block the `ghe-repl-stop` command and not allow replication to be stopped. Using `ghe-repo-stop --force` will now force Elasticsearch to stop when the service is in a normal or valid yellow status.
* VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor version 7.0 is now supported. [Updated: 2022-09-07]
### [3.5.1: Known issues](#3.5.1-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Deleted repositories will not be purged from disk automatically after the 90-day retention period ends. This issue is resolved in the 3.5.1 release. [Updated: 2022-06-10]
* Management Console may appear stuck on the *Starting* screen after upgrading an under-provisioned instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5. [Updated: 2022-06-20]
* The following features were unavailable for users in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The features are available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]

  + Detection of GitHub Actions workflow files for the dependency graph
  + Reopening of dismissed Dependabot alerts
  + Enabling the **Update branch** button for all pull requests in a repository
  + Light high contrast theme
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 as you upgrade to the latest release. To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade).

  + To display the missing alerts for all repositories owned by an organization, organization owners can navigate to the organization's **Code security and analysis** settings, then click **Enable all** for secret scanning. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#enabling-or-disabling-a-feature-for-all-existing-repositories)."
  + To display the missing alerts for an individual repository, people with admin access to the repository can disable then enable secret scanning for the repository. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)."

  A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) patch release. [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-12-07]

May 31, 2022

ðŸ“£ This is not the [latest patch release](#3.5.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

For upgrade instructions, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

### [3.5.0: Features](#3.5.0-features)

* #### [IP exception list for validation testing after maintenance](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#ip-exception-list-for-validation-testing-after-maintenance)
* You can now configure an allow list of IP addresses that can access application services on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance while maintenance mode is enabled. Administrators who visit the instance's web interface from an allowed IP address can validate the instance's functionality post-maintenance and before disabling maintenance mode. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#validating-changes-in-maintenance-mode-using-the-ip-exception-list)."
* #### [Custom repository roles are generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#custom-repository-roles-are-generally-available)
* With custom repository roles, organizations now have more granular control over the repository access permissions they can grant to users. For more information, see "[Managing custom repository roles for an organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization)."

  A custom repository role is created by an organization owner, and is available across all repositories in that organization. Each role can be given a custom name, and a description. It can be configured from a set of over 40 fine grained permissions. Once created, repository admins can assign a custom role to any user, team or outside collaborator in their repository.

  Custom repository roles can be created, viewed, edited and deleted via the new **Repository roles** tab in an organization's settings. A maximum of 3 custom roles can be created within an organization.

  Custom repository roles are also fully supported in the GitHub Enterprise Server REST APIs. The Organizations API can be used to list all custom repository roles in an organization, and the existing APIs for granting repository access to individuals and teams have been extended to support custom repository roles. For more information, see "[Organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/reference/orgs#list-custom-repository-roles-in-an-organization)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Container registry in public beta](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#github-container-registry-in-public-beta)
* The GitHub Container registry (GHCR) is now available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 as a public beta, offering developers the ability to publish, download, and manage containers. GitHub Packages container support implements the OCI standards for hosting Docker images. For more information, see "[GitHub Container registry](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)."
* #### [Dependabot updates are generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#dependabot-updates-are-generally-available)
* Dependabot version and security updates are now generally available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5. All the popular ecosystems and features that work on GitHub.com repositories now can be set up on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. Dependabot on GitHub Enterprise Server requires GitHub Actions and a pool of self-hosted Dependabot runners, GitHub Connect enabled, and Dependabot enabled by an admin. For more information, see "[Setting up Dependabot updates](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server/setting-up-dependabot-updates)."
* #### [Server Statistics in public beta](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#server-statistics-in-public-beta)
* You can now analyze how your team works, understand the value you get from GitHub Enterprise Server, and help us improve our products by reviewing your instance's usage data and sharing this aggregate data with GitHub. You can use your own tools to analyze your usage over time by downloading your data in a CSV or JSON file or by accessing it using the REST API. To see the list of aggregate metrics collected, see "[About Server Statistics](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/analyzing-how-your-team-works-with-server-statistics/about-server-statistics#server-statistics-data-collected)." Server Statistics data includes no personal data nor GitHub content, such as code, issues, comments, or pull requests content. For a better understanding of how we store and secure Server Statistics data, see "[GitHub Security](https://github.com/security)." For more information about Server Statistics, see "[Analyzing how your team works with Server Statistics](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/analyzing-how-your-team-works-with-server-statistics)." This feature is available in public beta.
* #### [GitHub Actions rate limiting is now configurable](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#github-actions-rate-limiting-is-now-configurable)
* Site administrators can now enable and configure a rate limit for GitHub Actions. By default, the rate limit is disabled. When workflow jobs cannot immediately be assigned to an available runner, they will wait in a queue until a runner is available. However, if GitHub Actions experiences a sustained high load, the queue can back up faster than it can drain and the performance of the GitHub Enterprise Server instance may degrade. To avoid this, an administrator can configure a rate limit. When the rate limit is exceeded, additional workflow runs will fail immediately rather than being put in the queue. Once the rate has stabilized below the threshold, new runs can be queued again. For more information, see "[Configuring rate limits](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-rate-limits#configuring-rate-limits-for-github-actions)."
* #### [OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure deployments with GitHub Actions](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#openid-connect-oidc-for-secure-deployments-with-github-actions)
* GitHub Actions on GitHub Enterprise Server now supports OIDC for secure deployments to cloud providers, which uses short-lived tokens that are automatically rotated for each deployment. OIDC enables the following functionality.

  + Seamless authentication between cloud providers and GitHub Enterprise Server without the need for storing any long-lived cloud secrets on your instance
  + Cloud administrators can rely on the security mechanisms of a particular cloud provider to ensure that GitHub Actions workflows have minimal access to cloud resources. There is no duplication of secret management between GitHub Enterprise Server and the cloud.

  For more information, see "[Security hardening your deployments](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments)."
* #### [Sharing GitHub Actions within your enterprise is generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#sharing-github-actions-within-your-enterprise-is-generally-available)
* Support for GitHub Actions in internal repositories is now generally available for organizations on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. You can innersource automation by sharing actions in internal repositories. You can manage a repository's settings or use the REST API to allow access to workflows in other repositories within the organization or in any organization on the instance. For more information, see "[Sharing actions and workflows with your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/creating-actions/sharing-actions-and-workflows-with-your-enterprise)," "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#allowing-access-to-components-in-an-internal-repository)," and "[Actions Permissions](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/actions/permissions#get-the-level-of-access-for-workflows-outside-of-the-repository)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Cache support for GitHub Actions on GitHub Enterprise Server is now generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#cache-support-for-github-actions-on-github-enterprise-server-is-now-generally-available)
* You can now use dependency caching to speed up your GitHub Actions workflows. To cache dependencies for a job, you can include the [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) action to create a cache with a unique key. You can share caches across all workflows in the same repository. These workflows can then restore the cache and run faster.

  Actions users can also use our cache APIs to:

  + Define the enterprise policy for cache size range allowed per repository.
  + Query the cache usage within each repository and monitor if the total size of all caches is reaching the upper limit.
  + Increase the maximum cache size for a repository within the allowed enterprise limits, based on the cache requirements of the repository.
  + Monitor aggregate cache usage at organization level or at enterprise level.

  The external blob storage that is configured within your enterprise account will now be shared across workflow artifacts, logs, and also the caches. For more information, see "[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)."
* #### [Automatically sign commits made in the web UI](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#automatically-sign-commits-made-in-the-web-ui)
* You can now configure GitHub Enterprise Server to automatically sign commits made in the web interface, such as from editing a file or merging a pull request. Signed commits increase confidence that changes come from trusted sources. This feature allows the [Require signed commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-signed-commits) branch protection setting to block unsigned commits from entering a repository, while allowing entry of signed commits â€“ even those made in the web interface. For more information, see "[Configuring web commit signing](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-web-commit-signing)."
* #### [Sync license usage any time](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#sync-license-usage-any-time)
* For customers that sync license usage between GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud automatically using GitHub Connect, you now have the ability to sync your license usage independently of the automatic weekly sync. This feature also reports the status of sync job. For more information, see "[Syncing license usage between GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/syncing-license-usage-between-github-enterprise-server-and-github-enterprise-cloud#manually-syncing-license-usage)."
* #### [Reusable workflows for GitHub Actions are generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#reusable-workflows-for-github-actions-are-generally-available)
* Reusable workflows are now generally available. Reusable workflows help you reduce duplication by enabling you to reuse an entire workflow as if it were an action. With the general availability release, a number of improvements are now available for GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Reusing workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)."

  + You can utilize outputs to pass data from reusable workflows to other jobs in the caller workflow.
  + You can pass environment secrets to reusable workflows.
  + The audit log includes information about which reusable workflows are used.
  + Reusable workflows in the same repository as the calling repository can be referenced with just the path and filename (`PATH/FILENAME`). The called workflow will be from the same commit as the caller workflow.
* #### [Self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions can now disable automatic updates](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#self-hosted-runners-for-github-actions-can-now-disable-automatic-updates)
* You now have more control over when your self-hosted runners perform software updates. If you specify the `--disableupdate` flag to the runner then it will not try to perform an automatic software update if a newer version of the runner is available. This allows you to update the self-hosted runner on your own schedule, and is especially convenient if your self-hosted runner is in a container.

  For compatibility with the GitHub Actions service, you will need to manually update your runner within 30 days of a new runner version being available. For instructions on how to install the latest runner version, please see the installation instructions for [the latest release in the runner repo](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases).
* #### [Secure self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions by limiting workflows](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#secure-self-hosted-runners-for-github-actions-by-limiting-workflows)
* Organization owners can now increase the security of CI/CD workflows on self-hosted runners by choosing which workflows can access a runner group. Previously, any workflow in a repository, such as an issue labeler, could access the self-hosted runners available to an organization. For more information, see "[Managing access to self-hosted runners using groups](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#changing-what-workflows-can-access-a-runner-group)" and the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-03-23-github-actions-secure-self-hosted-runners-specific-workflows/).
* #### [Prevent GitHub Actions from approving pull requests](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#prevent-github-actions-from-approving-pull-requests)
* You can now control whether GitHub Actions can approve pull requests. This feature protects against a user using GitHub Actions to satisfy the "Required approvals" branch protection requirement and merging a change that was not reviewed by another user. To prevent breaking existing workflows, **Allow GitHub Actions reviews to count towards required approval** is enabled by default. Organization owners can disable the feature in the organization's GitHub Actions settings. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#preventing-github-actions-from-approving-pull-requests)."
* #### [Re-run failed or individual GitHub Actions jobs](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#re-run-failed-or-individual-github-actions-jobs)
* You can now re-run only failed jobs or an individual job in a GitHub Actions workflow run. For more information, see "[Re-running workflows and jobs](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs)."
* #### [Dependency graph supports GitHub Actions](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#dependency-graph-supports-github-actions)
* The dependency graph now detects YAML files for GitHub Actions workflows. GitHub Enterprise Server will display the workflow files within the **Insights** tab's dependency graph section. Repositories that publish actions will also be able to see the number of repositories that depend on that action from the "Used By" control on the repository homepage. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."

  + **Note**: This feature was unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The feature is available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]

When GitHub Enterprise Server detects that a dependency in your repository is vulnerable, Dependabot will attempt to open a pull request to update that dependency to a non-vulnerable version. You can now see the pull request that fixes the vulnerability. In some cases, Dependabot fails to open a pull request. Previously, the error message that Dependabot generated was only visible in the "Dependabot Alerts" section of the **Security** tab. Now, if Dependabot runs into an error when trying to open a pull request for a security alert, you can determine the reason using the GraphQL API. For more information, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/graphql/reference/objects#dependabotupdate)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [Access more information about Dependabot alerts via GraphQL API](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#access-more-information-about-dependabot-alerts-via-graphql-api)
* You can now view fixed alerts from Dependabot with the GraphQL API. You can also access and filter by state, as well as by unique numeric identifier, and you can filter by state on the vulnerability alert object. The following fields now exist for a `RepositoryVulnerabilityAlert`.

  + `number`
  + `fixed_at`
  + `fix_reason`
  + `state`

  For more information, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/graphql/reference/objects#repositoryvulnerabilityalert)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [Git events in the enterprise audit log](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#git-events-in-the-enterprise-audit-log)
* The following Git-related events can now appear in the enterprise audit log. If you enable the feature and set an audit log retention period, the new events will be available for search via the UI and API, or export via JSON or CSV.

  + `git.clone`
  + `git.fetch`
  + `git.push`

  Due to the large number of Git events logged, we recommend you monitor your instance's file storage and review your related alert configurations. For more information, see "[Configuring the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/configuring-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#managing-git-events-in-the-audit-log)."
* #### [Improvements to CODEOWNERS](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#improvements-to-codeowners)
* This release includes improvements to CODEOWNERS.

  + Syntax errors are now surfaced when viewing a CODEOWNERS file from the web. Previously, when a line in a CODEOWNERS file had a syntax error, the error would be ignored or in some cases cause the entire CODEOWNERS file to not load. GitHub Apps and Actions can access the same list of errors using new REST and GraphQL APIs. For more information, see "[Repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/repos/repos#list-codeowners-errors)" in the REST API documentation or "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/graphql/reference/objects#repositorycodeowners)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
  + After someone creates a new pull request or pushes new changes to a draft pull request, any code owners that will be requested for review are now listed in the pull request under "Reviewers". This feature gives you an early look at who will be requested to review once the pull request is marked ready for review.
  + Comments in CODEOWNERS files can now appear at the end of a line, not just on dedicated lines.

  For more information, see "[About code owners](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)."
* #### [More ways to keep a pull request's topic branch up to date](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#more-ways-to-keep-a-pull-requests-topic-branch-up-to-date)
* The **Update branch** button on the pull request page lets you update your pull request's branch with the latest changes from the base branch. This is useful for verifying your changes are compatible with the current version of the base branch before you merge. Two enhancements now give you more ways to keep your branch up-to-date.

  + When your pull request's topic branch is out of date with the base branch, you now have the option to update it by rebasing on the latest version of the base branch. Rebasing applies the changes from your branch onto the latest version of the base branch, resulting in a branch with a linear history since no merge commit is created. To update by rebasing, click the drop down menu next to the **Update Branch** button, click **Update with rebase**, and then click **Rebase branch**. Previously, **Update branch** performed a traditional merge that always resulted in a merge commit in your pull request branch. This option is still available, but now you have the choice. For more information, see "[Keeping your pull request in sync with the base branch](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/keeping-your-pull-request-in-sync-with-the-base-branch)."
  + A new repository setting allows the **Update branch** button to always be available when a pull request's topic branch is not up to date with the base branch. Previously, this button was only available when the **Require branches to be up to date before merging** branch protection setting was enabled. People with admin or maintainer access can manage the **Always suggest updating pull request branches** setting from the **Pull Requests** section in repository settings. For more information, see "[Managing suggestions to update pull request branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-suggestions-to-update-pull-request-branches)."

    - **Note**: This feature was unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The feature is available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]
* #### [Configure custom HTTP headers for GitHub Pages sites](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#configure-custom-http-headers-for-github-pages-sites)
* You can now configure custom HTTP headers that apply to all GitHub Pages sites served from your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Pages for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-github-pages-for-your-enterprise#configuring-github-pages-response-headers-for-your-enterprise)."
* #### [Ignore commits in blame view](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#ignore-commits-in-blame-view)
* It's now possible to ignore revisions in the blame view by creating a *.git-blame-ignore-revs* file in the root of your repository. For more information, see "[Viewing a file](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view)."
* #### [Light high contrast theme is generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#light-high-contrast-theme-is-generally-available)
* A light high contrast theme, with greater contrast between foreground and background elements, is now generally available. For more information, see "[Managing your theme settings](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/managing-your-theme-settings)."

  + **Note**: This feature was unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The feature is available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]
* #### [Tag protection rules](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#tag-protection-rules)
* Repository owners can now configure tag protection rules to protect a repository's tags. Once protected by a tag protection rule, tags matching a specified name pattern can only be created and deleted by users with the Maintain or Admin role in the repository. For more information, see "[Configuring tag protection rules](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-tag-protection-rules)."
* #### [Edit files within pull requests in GitHub Mobile for iOS](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#edit-files-within-pull-requests-in-github-mobile-for-ios)
* In GitHub Mobile for iOS 1.80.0 and later, users can now edit files within a pull request's topic branch. Support for editing files will come to GitHub Mobile for Android in a future release. [Updated: 2022-09-13]
### [3.5.0: Bug fixes](#3.5.0-bugs)

* It is now possible for GitHub Apps to upload release assets.
### [3.5.0: Changes](#3.5.0-changes)

* Minimum requirements for root storage and memory increased for GitHub Enterprise Server 2.10 and 3.0, and are now enforced as of 3.5.0.

  + In version 2.10, the minimum requirement for root storage increased from 80 GB to 200 GB. As of 3.5.0, system preflight checks will fail if the root storage is smaller than 80 GB.
  + In version 3.0, the minimum requirement for memory increased from 16 GB to 32 GB. As of 3.5.0, system preflight checks will fail if the system has less than 28 GB of memory.

  For more information, see the minimum requirements for each supported deployment platform in "[Setting up a GitHub Enterprise Server instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)." [Updated: 2022-06-20]
* VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor version 7.0 is now supported. [Updated: 2022-09-07]
* To use the device authorization flow for OAuth and GitHub Apps, you must manually enable the feature. This change reduces the likelihood of apps being used in phishing attacks against GitHub Enterprise Server users by ensuring integrators are aware of the risks and make a conscious choice to support this form of authentication. If you own or manage an OAuth App or GitHub App and you want to use the device flow, you can enable it for your app via the app's settings page. The device flow API endpoints will respond with status code `400` to apps that have not enabled this feature. For more information, see "[Authorizing OAuth Apps](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow)."
* The code scanning alert page now always shows the alert status and information for the default branch. There is a new "Affected branches" panel in the sidebar where you can see the status of the alert in other branches. If the alert does not exist in your default branch, the alert page will show the status as "In branch" or "In pull request" for the location where the alert was last seen. This improvement makes it easier to understand the status of alerts which have been introduced into your code base. For more information, see "[About code scanning alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-alert-details)."

  The alert list page is not changed and can be filtered by `branch`. You can use the code scanning API to retrieve more detailed branch information for alerts. For more information, see "[Code Scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/code-scanning)" in the REST API documentation.
* Code scanning now shows the details of the analysis origin of an alert. If an alert has more than one analysis origin, it is shown in the "Affected branches" sidebar and in the alert timeline. You can hover over the analysis origin icon in the "Affected branches" sidebar to see the alert status in each analysis origin. If an alert only has a single analysis origin, no information about analysis origins is displayed on the alert page. These improvements will make it easier to understand your alerts. In particular, it will help you understand those that have multiple analysis origins. This is especially useful for setups with multiple analysis configurations, such as monorepos. For more information, see "[About code scanning alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-analysis-origins)."
* Lists of repositories owned by a user or organization now have an additional filter option, "Templates", making it easier to find template repositories.
* GitHub Enterprise Server can display several common image formats, including PNG, JPG, GIF, PSD, and SVG, and provides several ways to compare differences between versions. Now when reviewing added or changed images in a pull request, previews of those images are shown by default. Previously, you would see a message indicating that binary files could not be shown and you would need to toggle the "Display rich diff" option. For more information, see "[Working with non-code files](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files)."
* New gists are now created with a default branch name of either `main` or the alternative default branch name defined in your user settings. This matches how other repositories are created on GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[About branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch)" and "[Managing the default branch name for your repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)."
* Gists now only show the 30 most recent comments when first displayed. You can click **Load earlier comments...** to view more. This allows gists that have many comments to appear more quickly. For more information, see "[Editing and sharing content with gists](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists)."
* Settings pages for users, organizations, repositories, and teams have been redesigned, grouping similar settings pages into sections for improved information architecture and discoverability. For more information, see the [GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-02-02-redesign-of-githubs-settings-pages/).
* Focusing or hovering over a label now displays the label description in a tooltip.
* Creating and removing repository invitations, whether done through the API or web interface, are now subject to rate limits that may be enabled on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. For more information about rate limits, see "[Configuring rate limits](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-rate-limits)."
* MinIO has announced the removal of the MinIO Gateways starting June 1st, 2022. While MinIO Gateway for NAS continues to be one of the supported storage providers for Github Actions and Github Packages, we recommend moving to MinIO LTS support to avail support and bug fixes from MinIO. For more information about rate limits, see "[Scheduled removal of MinIO Gateway for GCS, Azure, HDFS in the minio/minio repository](https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/14331)."
### [3.5.0: Deprecations](#3.5.0-deprecations)

* #### [Change to the format of authentication tokens affects GitHub Connect](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#change-to-the-format-of-authentication-tokens-affects-github-connect)
* GitHub Connect will no longer work after June 3rd for instances running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1 or older, due to the format of GitHub authentication tokens changing. To continue using GitHub Connect, upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.2 or later. For more information, see the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-05-20-action-needed-by-github-connect-customers-using-ghes-3-1-and-older-to-adopt-new-authentication-token-format-updates/). [Updated: 2022-06-14]
* #### [CodeQL runner deprecated in favor of CodeQL CLI](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#codeql-runner-deprecated-in-favor-of-codeql-cli)
* The CodeQL runner is deprecated in favor of the CodeQL CLI. GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 and later no longer include the CodeQL runner. This deprecation only affects users who use CodeQL code scanning in 3rd party CI/CD systems. GitHub Actions users are not affected. GitHub strongly recommends that customers migrate to the CodeQL CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the CodeQL runner and has many additional features. For more information, see "[Migrating from the CodeQL runner to CodeQL CLI](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/code-scanning/using-codeql-code-scanning-with-your-existing-ci-system/migrating-from-the-codeql-runner-to-codeql-cli)."
* #### [Theme picker for GitHub Pages has been removed](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#theme-picker-for-github-pages-has-been-removed)
* The theme picker for GitHub Pages has been removed from the Pages settings. For more information about configuration of themes for GitHub Pages, see "[Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)."
### [3.5.0: Known issues](#3.5.0-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Deleted repositories will not be purged from disk automatically after the 90-day retention period ends. This issue is resolved in the 3.5.1 patch release. [Updated: 2022-06-10]
* Management Console may appear stuck on the *Starting* screen after upgrading an under-provisioned instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5. [Updated: 2022-06-20]
* The following features were unavailable for users in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The features are available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]

  + Detection of GitHub Actions workflow files for the dependency graph
  + Reopening of dismissed Dependabot alerts
  + Enabling the **Update branch** button for all pull requests in a repository
  + Light high contrast theme
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 as you upgrade to the latest release. To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade).

  + To display the missing alerts for all repositories owned by an organization, organization owners can navigate to the organization's **Code security and analysis** settings, then click **Enable all** for secret scanning. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#enabling-or-disabling-a-feature-for-all-existing-repositories)."
  + To display the missing alerts for an individual repository, people with admin access to the repository can disable then enable secret scanning for the repository. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)."

  A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) patch release. [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-12-07]
### [3.5.0: Errata](#3.5.0-errata)

* "[Encrypted secrets](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service. [Updated: 2023-06-01]
