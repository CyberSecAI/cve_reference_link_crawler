<li>The <code>relatedLocations</code> field has been added to the SARIF response when you request a code scanning analysis.

Previously, users needed to manually run a historical scan.\n","On instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license, to ensure that future releases of GitHub Enterprise Server can always display a preview of a detected secret in the APIs or web UI, the detected secrets are now stored separately from source code. Detected secrets are stored using symmetric encryption. [Updated: 2023-02-15]\n","When using private registries for Dependabot updates, GitHub Enterprise Server behaves more securely. If a private registry is configured for any of the following ecosystems, the instance will no longer make any package requests to public registries.\n\n- Bundler\n- Docker\n- Gradle\n- Maven\n- npm\n- Nuget\n- Python\n- Yarn\n\nFor more information, see \"[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#configuration-options-for-private-registries).\"\n","Elixir developers who use [self-hosted Hex repositories](https://hex.pm/docs/self_hosting) can configure a private registry for Dependabot version updates on GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see \"[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#configuration-options-for-private-registries).\"\n","Dependabot alerts features the following usability improvements.\n\n- The page for an alert refreshes automatically after Dependabot attempts to create a pull request for an update.\n- Alerts are more accurately mapped to pull requests from Dependabot updates.\n- To improve the alert for the community, users can suggest improvements to alerts directly in the GitHub Advisory Database.\n","Users can more easily mention **@dependabot**. When mentioning users, the Dependabot user account now appears as an autocomplete suggestion.\n","In repositories with vulnerable dependencies, Dependabot will no longer display a yellow banner. To notify contributors of vulnerable dependencies, the **Security** tab displays an alert counter.\n","If a user forks a repository with an existing Dependabot configuration in `dependabot.yml`, Dependabot updates will be disabled in the fork by default. To enable updates in the fork, the user must visit the repository's code security and analysis settings. For more information, see \"[Configuring Dependabot version updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates).\"\n","Integrators who wish to receive a webhook for Dependabot alerts must use the new `dependabot_alert` webhook. This webhook replaces the `repository_vulnerability_alert` webhook. For more information, see \"[Webhook events and payloads](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#dependabot_alert).\"\n","To improve readability of GitHub Actions workflows that reference other actions by commit SHA, action authors often write a comment including the corresponding semantic version on the line that calls the action. To save time, pull requests for Dependabot version updates will now automatically update the semantic version in these comments.\n","JavaScript developers who use Node.js, npm, and Dependabot security updates can save time when updating npm projects with transitive dependencies.\n\n- Dependabot can update both parent and child dependencies together. Previously, Dependabot would not update transitive dependencies when the parent required an incompatible specific version range, requiring manual upgrades.\n- Dependabot can create pull requests that resolve alerts where an update to a direct dependency would remove the vulnerable transitive dependency from the tree.\n\nFor more information, see \"[About Dependabot security updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates).\"\n","For people who use Dependabot for version updates in the Docker ecosystem, Dependabot will proactively update Docker image tags in Kubernetes manifests. For more information, see \"[Configuring Dependabot version updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)\" and \"[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#package-ecosystem).\"\n","A number of improvements are available to users who contribute to security advisories on GitHub.com, including the following changes.\n\n- To ensure faster review, GitHub prompts users to add a reason for the change.\n- To ensure that the contribution matches the user's intent, GitHub will not reorder reference links in the diff.\n","GitHub Actions features the following discoverability and accessibility improvements.\n\n- The navigation experience for searching workflows and workflow runs is improved.\n- Added structure better represents the hierarchy between caller and called reusable workflows.\n- The mobile browsing experience is more consistent, and supports multiple viewport sizes.\n","GitHub Actions workflows will no longer trigger endlessly when using `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch` events. Prior to this change, events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not create a new workflow run. For more information, see \"[Triggering a workflow](/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow).\"\n","For scheduled runs of GitHub Actions workflows, users will see additional information about the repository, organization, and enterprise within the payload for `github.event`.\n","Users of GitHub Actions have better insight into the progress of a job when using environment protection rules. The `workflow_job` webhook supports a new `waiting` state whenever a job is awaiting an environment protection rule. Also, when a job refers to an `environment` key in its YAML definition, the `workflow_job` webhook payload will also include a new property, `deployment`. `deployment` contains metadata about the deployment that the check run created. For more information, see \"[Using environments for deployment](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).\"\n","Organization owners can find more meaningful context within audit log events.\n\n- `business.sso_response` and `org.sso_response` events appear in the REST API and payloads for audit log streaming.\n- `repo.rename`, `project.rename`, and `protected_branch.update_name` events include the current and past names for these renamed within the `old_name` field.\n- Events for Dependabot alerts contain `alert_number`, `ghsa_id`, `dismiss_reason`, and `dismiss_comment` fields, in addition to a link back to the alert and an accurate timestamp.\n","Users can view a list that contains all of an organization's followers from the organization's profile.\n","The banner displayed atop an archived repository in the web UI now includes the repository's archival date.\n","The **Conversations** and **Files** tabs in pull requests now load more quickly due to deferred syntax highlighting.\n","To provide a more consistent experience between the web UI and users' workstations, and to speed up the process of checking whether users can merge a pull request automatically, GitHub Enterprise Server now uses the `merge-ort` strategy. For more information, see [Merge strategies](https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies#Documentation/merge-strategies.txt-ort) in the Git documentation.\n","To improve the display of the initial comment in pull requests that contain one commit, GitHub Enterprise Server now automatically reformats detailed commit messages to adhere to GitHub's Markdown conventions.\n","Before squash-merging a pull request, the web UI displays the email address of the commit's author.
