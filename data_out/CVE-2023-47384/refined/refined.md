The provided content is related to CVE-2023-47384.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak that occurs in the `gf_isom_add_chapter` function in the `isomedia/isom_write.c` file, specifically at line 3182. The crash is caused by a dereference of a high-value address within `strdup`, which is called within `gf_isom_add_chapter`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak in the `gf_isom_add_chapter` function.
- Potential for a segmentation fault due to the memory leak leading to an invalid memory access, specifically within the `strdup` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability is capable of causing crashes and potentially lead to denial of service (DoS).
- The crash can be triggered by a specially crafted input, which leads to the memory corruption and eventual segmentation fault.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted MP4 file using the `MP4Box` utility.
- The attack vector is the processing of a specially crafted input file through the command-line interface of the vulnerable application

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious input file (`crash65.zip`) to the `MP4Box` tool, utilizing the `-dash` option, specifically with a command like `./MP4Box -dash 10000 $poc`.
- The attacker would need to have the ability to execute the vulnerable binary with a crafted input.
