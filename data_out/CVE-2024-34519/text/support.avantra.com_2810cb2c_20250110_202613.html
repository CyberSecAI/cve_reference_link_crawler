## XAN-5367 - Security vulnerability fix for dashboards Print

Modified on: Wed, 10 Apr, 2024 at 12:13 PM

---

## Summary & Key Actions Required

Avantra has become aware of a high-severity data disclosure issue affecting customers running Avantra server 24 up to and including 24.0.6 and 24.1.0 where users have the ability to create dashboards with an auto-login user. This issue does not affect Avantra server versions before 24.0 and does not affect Avantra agents.

This issue could allow users with limited privileges to gain administrator permissions through creating a shared dashboard with a more privileged auto-login user, or users with no privileges can gain authenticated access to Avantra's UI with the privileges granted to the user the dashboard has been shared with.

We advise in the product that users created for the purpose of auto-login for dashboards should be limited to read only permissions however it is possible to set a more powerful user in this dialog.

**This issue is fixed in Avantra Server versions 24.0.7 and 24.1.1.**

## Mitigation

We have completed our investigations into this issue and have released patches for customers to immediately implement.

Customers running Avantra 24.0 and above are advised to upgrade to the latest Avantra server version of at least 24.0.7 or 24.1.1. Agents are not affected.
