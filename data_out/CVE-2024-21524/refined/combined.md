Out-of-bounds Read in node-stringbuilder@v2.2.7

 [Raw](/dellalibera/0bb022811224f81d998fa61c3175ee67/raw/94a4cd8db20b147ef8692a9505aa6b6a78f35541/01_Out-of-bounds_Read_node-stringbuilder%40v2.2.7.md)

[**01\_Out-of-bounds\_Read\_node-stringbuilder@v2.2.7.md**](#file-01_out-of-bounds_read_node-stringbuilder-v2-2-7-md)

# Information

**Package:** [node-stringbuilder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-stringbuilder)

**Tested Version:** `2.2.7`

**GitHub Repository:** <https://github.com/magiclen/node-stringbuilder>

**Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read

# Details

Due to incorrect memory length calculation, by calling `ToBuffer`, `ToString`, or `CharAt` on a `StringBuilder` object with a non-empty string value input, it's possible to return previously allocated memory, for example, by providing negative indexes.

Vulnerable code (`napi_create_string_utf16`):

* `ToBuffer`: <https://github.com/magiclen/node-stringbuilder/blob/5c2797d3d6bf8cb6d10fe1e077609cef9a5a7de0/src/node-stringbuilder.c#L1281>
* `ToString`: <https://github.com/magiclen/node-stringbuilder/blob/5c2797d3d6bf8cb6d10fe1e077609cef9a5a7de0/src/node-stringbuilder.c#L1324>
* `CharAt`: <https://github.com/magiclen/node-stringbuilder/blob/5c2797d3d6bf8cb6d10fe1e077609cef9a5a7de0/src/node-stringbuilder.c#L1819>

Similar issue:

* <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FASTSTRINGSEARCH-2392368>

# Setup

Tested on:

```
Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
Node v18.19.0
```

Installation:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
npm i node-stringbuilder
chmod +x ./run.sh
```

# PoC

Usage

```
./run.sh <poc1|poc2|poc3> <max_interations>
```

**NOTE**: It could happen that to see the previously allocated memory data printed, the `./run.sh` has to be executed multiple times. If you don't see any random bytes printed, run the `./run.sh` again.

* poc1

```
./run.sh poc1 50
```

Output:

```
...
Running poc1
[+] toString
AA<random-data>
Status code is -1. Exiting the loop.
```

* poc2

```
./run.sh poc2 50
```

Output:

```
...
Running poc2
[+] toBuffer
AA<random-data>
Status code is -1. Exiting the loop.
```

* poc2

```
./run.sh poc3 10
```

Output:

```
...
Running poc3
[+] charAt
<random-byte>
Status code is -1. Exiting the loop.
```

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `node-stringbuilder`.

## Overview

[node-stringbuilder](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-stringbuilder) is an An easy and fast in-memory string builder for Node.js.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read due to incorrect memory length calculation, by calling `ToBuffer`, `ToString`, or `CharAt` on a `StringBuilder` object with a non-empty string value input. It's possible to return previously allocated memory, for example, by providing negative indexes, leading to an Information Disclosure.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.2 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
