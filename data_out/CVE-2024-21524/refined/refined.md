  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2024-21524",
    "description": "The node-stringbuilder package is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to incorrect memory length calculation when calling ToBuffer, ToString, or CharAt on a StringBuilder object with a non-empty string value. This allows an attacker to return previously allocated memory by providing negative indexes, leading to information disclosure.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect memory length calculation within the node-stringbuilder library when handling string operations.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "impact": "Information Disclosure. The vulnerability allows attackers to read potentially sensitive data from previously allocated memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Calling `ToBuffer`, `ToString`, or `CharAt` methods with negative indexes on a `StringBuilder` object with a non-empty string value.",
      "Exploitation can occur over the network."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable methods on a `StringBuilder` object with a non-empty string and control the index argument.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered by passing negative indexes to the `ToBuffer`, `ToString`, or `CharAt` methods of the `StringBuilder` object, which leads to reading from arbitrary memory locations. The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates this by invoking these functions with negative index values."
