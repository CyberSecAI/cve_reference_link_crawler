Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-30966:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue in CFNetwork Proxies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper state management in handling proxy configurations.

**Impact of exploitation:** User traffic might unexpectedly be leaked to a proxy server despite configured Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) settings. This could expose user data to unauthorized entities.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by network traffic that interacts with CFNetwork proxies with a specially crafted PAC file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the network traffic that goes through the device and potentially control the PAC configurations. This could include a man-in-the-middle attack, or controlling a rogue proxy server.
