- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `logger_generic` function of the `Ax_rtu` binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-122, heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, authenticated attacker can trigger memory corruption, potentially leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS), arbitrary code execution with root privileges, or other unspecified impacts on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access, requiring prior authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
