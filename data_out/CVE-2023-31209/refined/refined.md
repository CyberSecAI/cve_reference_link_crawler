- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of parameters in core commands, specifically when creating passwords in the password store via the RestAPI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability. Attackers can inject arbitrary commands through a crafted password identifier.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the Checkmk site, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, utilizing the RestAPI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to have the permissions to use the RestAPI, create passwords in the password store, and create active checks. This suggests the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with specific privileges.
