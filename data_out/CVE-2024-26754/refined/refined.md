{
  "CVE-2024-26754": {
    "Description": "The provided commits fix a use-after-free and null-pointer dereference vulnerability in the `gtp_genl_dump_pdp()` function within the Linux kernel's GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) driver. This issue arises because the `gtp_net_ops` pernet operations structure for the subsystem was being registered *after* the generic netlink family registration, instead of before.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `gtp_net_ops` pernet operations structure was registered after the generic netlink family, leading to a use-after-free or null-pointer dereference when `gtp_genl_dump_pdp()` is called.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Null-pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploitation could lead to a general protection fault and potentially a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through the generic netlink interface, specifically when dumping PDP (Packet Data Protocol) contexts.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to interact with the generic netlink family associated with the GTP driver. This typically requires local access or the ability to send specific netlink messages."
