Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A specific sequence of processor instructions can lead to unexpected behavior in Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is present in the microarchitecture of the Intel Core Ultra Processors, specifically related to how certain instruction sequences are handled.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated user, with local access to the system, can potentially trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have some level of access to the system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges ("PR:L" - low privileges) or user interaction ("UI:N" - no user interaction). The attack complexity is high ("AC:H").

**Additional Notes:**

*   Intel is releasing microcode updates to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors with the following specifications: Meteor Lake platform, Client vertical segment, CPU ID 0XA06A4, Platform ID 0x7.
*   The CVSS score is 4.7, considered medium severity.
*   The CVSS vector string is "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H" which translates to:
    *   AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   AC:H (Attack Complexity: High)
    *   PR:L (Privileges Required: Low)
    *   UI:N (User Interaction: None)
    *   S:U (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   C:N (Confidentiality: None)
    *   I:N (Integrity: None)
    *   A:H (Availability: High)
