    "Metadata": {
      "Cve ID": "CVE-2018-3183",
      "Description": "OpenJDK: Unrestricted access to scripting engine (Scripting, 8202936)"
    },
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Scripting component of OpenJDK did not properly restrict access to the scripting engine in some situations.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Unrestricted access to the scripting engine."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions leading to arbitrary code execution, unauthorized reading or modification of data.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Through a specially constructed untrusted Java application or applet"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Attacker needs to be able to introduce and execute a malicious java application or applet on a vulnerable system.",
       "No specific privilege is required"
    ],
    "Additional Information": {
        "Netapp": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a takeover of Java, a partial denial of service (DoS) of Java, or unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process.",
         "RedHat": "An update for java-11-openjdk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and An update for java-1.8.0-oracle is now available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6,An update for java-1.8.0-ibm is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary and An update for java-1.8.0-openjdk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. All running instances of OpenJDK Java must be restarted for this update to take effect.",
         "Gentoo": "Users of Oracle JDK and JRE should upgrade to the latest versions",
         "Ubuntu": "It was discovered that the Scripting component did not properly restrict access to the scripting engine in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions."
