The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.3.14. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add, modify, or delete post meta and plugin options.
