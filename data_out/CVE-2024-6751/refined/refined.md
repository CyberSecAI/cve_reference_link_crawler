**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress lacks proper nonce validation in multiple functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to missing or incorrect nonce validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Unauthenticated attackers can add, modify, or delete post meta and plugin options.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed via CSRF, meaning an attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into performing an action they did not intend.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator to perform an action, such as clicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious page.
