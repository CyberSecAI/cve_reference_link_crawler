Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A global-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `read_coding_unit` function within the `slice.cc` file of the libde265 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is a **global-buffer-overflow**, specifically a read out-of-bounds issue.
- The overflow occurs when accessing `ctxIdxMap` in `slice.cc:4493`. The read operation attempts to access memory beyond the allocated boundary for this global variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to a crash due to the memory access violation (as evidenced by the ASAN output).
- The ASAN output shows a crash due to an attempt to read data outside of the allocated memory space for the global variable `ctxIdxMap`.
- This can cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted H.265 video bitstream that triggers the vulnerable code path during decoding.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the bitstream data in the function `read_coding_unit`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious H.265 bitstream as input to the decoder.
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position, as the vulnerability is triggered by parsing the bitstream data.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located at `libde265/libde265/slice.cc:4493`.
- The problematic read occurs 14 bytes after the `ctxIdxMap` global variable.
- The issue was addressed in commit `3e822a3`.
- CVE-2023-49468 was assigned to this issue
