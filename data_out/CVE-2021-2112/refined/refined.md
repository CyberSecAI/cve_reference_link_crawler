Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-2112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists within the core component of Oracle VM VirtualBox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed, but it's classified as a flaw within the core of VirtualBox. It is likely a memory corruption or logic error that allows for further exploitation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to a privilege escalation, meaning an attacker could gain higher-level access on the system where VirtualBox is running, potentially allowing them to control or compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker would require some form of access or presence on the system hosting the vulnerable VirtualBox instance. The attacker needs to execute code or trigger the vulnerability within the VirtualBox environment to escalate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable VirtualBox is installed and execute code within the context of VirtualBox to trigger the vulnerability. The level of access required to exploit the vulnerability is not explicitly mentioned in the document, but it is not exploitable over a network without authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The identified vulnerability is fixed in VirtualBox version 6.1.18 and later.
- The vulnerability is mentioned within the context of multiple other vulnerabilities, all fixed in the same release of VirtualBox.
- The Gentoo security advisory mentions that the vulnerability is "exploitable" as remote, but given it is not remotely exploitable without authentication it might be in a context specific to virtualization.

This information indicates that CVE-2021-2112 is a critical security vulnerability which allows a local attacker to escalate privileges on a machine using a vulnerable version of VirtualBox.
