Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0376

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied URLs within the Premium Addons for Elementor plugin's Wrapper Link Widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected code.
- This allows for potential malicious actions like redirection, data theft, or other attacks within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `premium_wrapper_link` field.
- The attack involves crafting a malicious URL that contains Javascript code and using the Wrapper Link Widget to add it to a WordPress page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access to the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level permissions.
- Ability to use the Elementor editor and the Premium Addons for Elementor plugin's Wrapper Link Widget.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Premium Addons for Elementor plugin versions up to and including 4.10.16.
- The fix was implemented in version 4.10.17 by refactoring the code to use `esc_url()` on the `href` attribute to properly sanitize it.
- The Wordfence article indicates that `get_permalink` also contributes to a safe output of the existing page link which did not seem to be sanitized before this patch
