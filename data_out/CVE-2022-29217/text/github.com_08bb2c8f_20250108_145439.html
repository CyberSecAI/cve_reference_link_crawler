## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Disclosed by Aapo Oksman (Senior Security Specialist, Nixu Corporation).

> PyJWT supports multiple different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an
>
> attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm.
>
> The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms
>
> are supported. The application can specify
>
> "jwt.algorithms.get\_default\_algorithms()" to get support for all
>
> algorithms. They can also specify a single one of them (which is the
>
> usual use case if calling jwt.decode directly. However, if calling
>
> jwt.decode in a helper function, all algorithms might be enabled.)
>
> For example, if the user chooses "none" algorithm and the JWT checker
>
> supports that, there will be no signature checking. This is a common
>
> security issue with some JWT implementations.
>
> PyJWT combats this by requiring that the if the "none" algorithm is
>
> used, the key has to be empty. As the key is given by the application
>
> running the checker, attacker cannot force "none" cipher to be used.
>
> Similarly with HMAC (symmetric) algorithm, PyJWT checks that the key is
>
> not a public key meant for asymmetric algorithm i.e. HMAC cannot be used
>
> if the key begins with "ssh-rsa". If HMAC is used with a public key, the
>
> attacker can just use the publicly known public key to sign the token
>
> and the checker would use the same key to verify.
>
> From PyJWT 2.0.0 onwards, PyJWT supports ed25519 asymmetric algorithm.
>
> With ed25519, PyJWT supports public keys that start with "ssh-", for
>
> example "ssh-ed25519".

### Patches

Users should upgrade to v2.4.0.

### Workarounds

Always be explicit with the algorithms that are accepted and expected when decoding.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
