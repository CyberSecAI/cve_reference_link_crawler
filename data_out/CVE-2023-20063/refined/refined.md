Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the inter-device communication mechanisms between Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) and Firepower Management Center (FMC) software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Code Injection (CWE-94). The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root permissions on the underlying operating system of the affected device. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device, including data theft, system disruption, or further attacks on the network. Specifically:
    *   An attacker with admin privileges on an FTD device can execute arbitrary code on an associated FMC device.
    *   Conversely, an attacker with admin privileges on an FMC device can execute arbitrary code on an associated FTD device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device and be able to access the "expert mode". They then submit malicious commands to a connected system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user with administrative privileges on either the Cisco FTD or FMC device.
    *   The attacker must be able to access the "expert mode" of the affected device.

The document also notes that this vulnerability poses a greater risk when different individuals manage the FTD and FMC devices. If the same individuals manage both with administrative privileges, the attacker would not gain additional privileges.
