SUMMARY

JT Open Toolkit and PLM XML SDK are affected by stack buffer overflow and null pointer dereference vulnerabilities that could be triggered while parsing XML file. If a user is tricked to open a malicious XML file with any of the affected products, this could cause the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
