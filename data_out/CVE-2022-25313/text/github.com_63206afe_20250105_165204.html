### @ferivoz **[ferivoz](/ferivoz)** commented [Feb 15, 2022](#issue-1138613076)

It is possible to trigger stack exhaustion in build\_model function if

depth of nested children in DTD element is large enough. This happens

because build\_node is a recursively called function within build\_model.

The code has been adjusted to run iteratively. It uses the already

allocated heap space as temporary stack (growing from top to bottom).

Output is identical to recursive version. No new fields in data

structures were added, i.e. it keeps full API and ABI compatibility.

Instead the numchildren variable is used to temporarily keep the

index of items (uint vs int).

Documentation and readability improvements kindly added by Sebastian.

Proof of Concept:

1. Compile poc binary which parses XML file line by line

```
cat > poc.c << EOF
 #include <err.h>
 #include <expat.h>
 #include <stdio.h>

 XML_Parser parser;

 static void XMLCALL
 dummy_element_decl_handler(void *userData, const XML_Char *name,
                            XML_Content *model) {
   XML_FreeContentModel(parser, model);
 }

 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   FILE *fp;
   char *p = NULL;
   size_t s = 0;
   ssize_t l;
   if (argc != 2)
     errx(1, "usage: poc poc.xml");
   if ((parser = XML_ParserCreate(NULL)) == NULL)
     errx(1, "XML_ParserCreate");
   XML_SetElementDeclHandler(parser, dummy_element_decl_handler);
   if ((fp = fopen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL)
     err(1, "fopen");
   while ((l = getline(&p, &s, fp)) > 0)
     if (XML_Parse(parser, p, (int)l, XML_FALSE) != XML_STATUS_OK)
       errx(1, "XML_Parse");
   XML_ParserFree(parser);
   free(p);
   fclose(fp);
   return 0;
 }
EOF
cc -std=c11 -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L -lexpat -o poc poc.c

```

2. Create XML file with a lot of nested groups in DTD element

```
cat > poc.xml.zst.b64 << EOF
KLUv/aQkACAAPAEA+DwhRE9DVFlQRSB1d3UgWwo8IUVMRU1FTlQgdXd1CigBAHv/58AJAgAQKAIA

EOF
base64 -d poc.xml.zst.b64 | zstd -d > poc.xml

```
