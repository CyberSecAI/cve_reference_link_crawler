Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before they are used in a system call within the Telnet CLI service.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the insufficient input validation in the Telnet CLI service of the D-Link DAP-2622 device. This allows for command injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected D-Link DAP-2622 device with root privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-adjacent and targets the Telnet CLI service, which listens on TCP port 23.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device and must have valid credentials to authenticate to the Telnet CLI service.

The advisory provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific port used (TCP 23), the affected service (Telnet CLI), and the root cause being a lack of input validation. The advisory also details the timeline of disclosure with the vendor.
