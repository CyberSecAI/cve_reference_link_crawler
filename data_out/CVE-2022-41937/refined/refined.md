Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-41937.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization check in the Filter Stream Converter application.
- Insufficient privilege management, allowing users without programming rights to exploit the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with view access could modify any page in the wiki by importing a crafted XAR package.
- Potential for complete compromise of the wiki's integrity due to unauthorized modification.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Exploitation through the web interface of the XWiki platform.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires network access to the XWiki platform.
- Requires "view" access to the wiki.
- Does not require user interaction.
- Requires knowledge of the Filter Stream Converter application's vulnerability and the ability to create a crafted XAR package.
