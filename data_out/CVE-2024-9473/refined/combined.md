The MSI installer of GlobalProtect of Palo Alto Networks contains a privilege escalation vulnerability. This enables a local, low-privileged attacker with GUI access to a system, where GlobalProtect is installed via the MSI installer, to escalate the privileges to SYSTEM level.

## Vendor description

*"GlobalProtect enables you to use Palo Alto Networks next-gen firewalls or Prisma Access to secure your mobile workforce."*

Source: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect>

## Business recommendation

The vendor provides a patched version v6.2.5 which should be installed immediately. Further affected branches will be patched by the vendor in the future, except branch 5.2.x which is EOL. Users are urged to upgrade to the most recent versions.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further security issues.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Local Privilege Escalation via MSI installer (CVE-2024-9473)

The configuration of the GlobalProtect MSI installer file was found to produce a visible conhost.exe window running as the SYSTEM user when using the repair function of msiexec.exe. This allows a local, low-privileged attacker to use a chain of actions, to open a fully functional cmd.exe with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.

## Proof of concept

### 1) Local Privilege Escalation via MSI installer (CVE-2024-9473)

For the exploit to work, GlobalProtect has to be installed via the MSI file. Afterwards, any low-privileged user can start the repair of GlobalProtect by double-clicking the installer and trigger the vulnerable actions without a UAC popup. The installer, if deleted from it's original location, can be found in C:\Windows\Installer with a randomized name.

During the repair process, the subprocess PanVCrediChecker.exe gets called with SYSTEM privileges and performs a read action on the file "C:\Program Files\Palo Alto Networks\GlobalProtect\libeay32.dll".

This can be used by an attacker by simply setting an oplock on the file. As soon as it gets read, the process is blocked until the lock is released. To do that, one can use the 'SetOpLock.exe' tool from "https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools" with the following parameters, see figure 1:

```
SetOpLock.exe "C:\Program Files\Palo Alto Networks\GlobalProtect\libeay32.dll" x
```

Figure 1: SetOpLock.exe execution

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Advisories/2024_10/sec-consult-c-palo-alto-openbrowser.png)

Figure 2: Open browser (untick "Always use this app")

During the repair process, the locked file is accessed several times. The lock has to be released by pressing ENTER five times before the conhost.exe window opens. For the sixth request, the lock should not be released to keep the window open. The conhost window that gets opened when PanVcrediChecker.exe is executed doesn't close and can then be interacted with.

The attacker can then perform the following actions to spawn a SYSTEM shell:

* Right click on the top bar of the window
* Click on properties [see figure 2 below]
* Under options, click on the "new console features" link [see figure 2 below]
* Open the link with e.g. firefox or chrome [see figure 2 below]
![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Advisories/2024_10/sec-consult-c-palo-alto-cmd.png)

Figure 3: Execution of cmd.exe as SYSTEM

* In the opened browser window press the key combination CTRL+o
* Type cmd.exe in the top bar and press Enter [see figure 3 below]

Note that this does not work using a recent version of the Edge Browser.

## Vulnerable / tested versions

The following versions have been tested which were the only versions available to SEC Consult at the time of the test. SEC Consult was not entirely sure, which exact version the product was:

* ProductVersion as stated by the PropertyTable: 5.2.10
* Version as stated by Windows after installing: 5.1.5
* 6.1.2 is affected as well

The vendor confirmed that versions <6.2.5 are affected. Furthermore, all other branches 5.1.x, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x and 6.3.x are affected as well. Branch 5.2.x is end of life according to the vendor and will not be patched.

Further information can be found at the vendor's website: <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com>

Users are urged to upgrade to the latest version and remove old versions of the MSI installer, especially users of v5.2.x as this branch is EOL and won't receive an update.

 SEC Consult has also released a blog post on 12th September 2024 regarding MSI installer security issues tracked as CVE-2024-38014 and a general fix by Microsoft. We have contacted Microsoft to have a more general solution for every affected vendor. For further details check out the blog post: <https://r.sec-consult.com/msi>

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue. However, a proof of concept for this issue is publicly available.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-250 Execution with Unnecessary Privileges](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 6.0.10-c823, GlobalProtect app 6.1.4-c720, GlobalProtect app 6.2.5, GlobalProtect app 6.3.1-c383, and will be fixed in the remaining supported versions of GlobalProtect app listed in the Product Status section. Updates will be published to this advisory as they become available.

Customers who want to upgrade should reach out to customer support at <https://support.paloaltonetworks.com>.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Update the Windows registry on endpoints with an affected version of GlobalProtect to disable all MSI installations (not just GlobalProtect installations). This change is system-wide, so it will affect all users of the system including administrators. The following command will update the registry on an endpoint to disable the repair functionality of any MSI file. It will also prevent using MSI files to install, re-install, or uninstall software. This command must be run with administrative privileges.

 `reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer" /v DisableMSI /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`
