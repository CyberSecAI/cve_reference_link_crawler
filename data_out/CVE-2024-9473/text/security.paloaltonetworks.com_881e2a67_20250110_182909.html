Customers who want to upgrade should reach out to customer support at <https://support.paloaltonetworks.com>.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Update the Windows registry on endpoints with an affected version of GlobalProtect to disable all MSI installations (not just GlobalProtect installations). This change is system-wide, so it will affect all users of the system including administrators. The following command will update the registry on an endpoint to disable the repair functionality of any MSI file. It will also prevent using MSI files to install, re-install, or uninstall software. This command must be run with administrative privileges.

 `reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer" /v DisableMSI /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`
