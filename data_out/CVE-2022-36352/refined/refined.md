- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to broken access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control. This allows an unprivileged user to execute privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact will vary depending on the function affected.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting a function within the ProfileGrid plugin that lacks proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber or a user with an even lower privilege level.
