Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36893:

**CVE-2022-36893**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `rpmsign-plugin` for Jenkins does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation. Specifically, the plugin fails to verify if the user has sufficient permissions to access the workspace.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks before allowing access to workspace contents.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerable form validation method reveals information about whether attacker-specified file patterns match workspace content.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Workspace Content Listing:** Attackers can exploit the lack of permission checks to determine what files exist within a project's workspace. While not direct file access, this exposes directory structures and potentially file names that may reveal sensitive information, aid in targeted attacks, or provide a foundation for more serious exploits.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessed through an HTTP endpoint that is used for form validation.
    *   The attacker crafts requests that include file patterns to probe the workspace contents.
    *   A sequence of requests could effectively list the workspace contents.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Item/Read Permission:** The attacker needs Item/Read permission for a Jenkins project.
    *   **No Workspace or Configure Permissions**: The attacker must lack Item/Workspace or Item/Configure permission to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability allows an attacker with Item/Read permission but without Item/Workspace or Item/Configure permission to determine if attacker-specified file patterns match workspace contents. By crafting multiple requests, an attacker can effectively list the entire workspace content without having the necessary permissions, leading to unauthorized information disclosure.
