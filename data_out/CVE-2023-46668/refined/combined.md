**Elastic Endpoint Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File (ESA-2023-21)**

If Elastic Endpoint (v7.9.0 - v8.10.3) is configured to use a non-default option in which the logging level is explicitly set to debug, and when Elastic Agent is simultaneously configured to collect and send those logs to Elasticsearch, then Elastic Agent API keys can be viewed in Elasticsearch in plaintext.

These API keys could be used to write arbitrary data and read Elastic Endpoint user artifacts.

**Affected Versions:**

Elastic Endpoint v7.9.0 - v8.10.3

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Upgrade to v8.10.4 or above.

For users unable to upgrade, ensure that the logging has not been set to debug.

Where debug logging has been enabled, users should purge Endpoint logs by disabling the Endpoint Security integration, waiting for Elastic Agent to apply policy, then re-enabling it. Ensure all Elastic Agents are online as any offline Agents won't receive the "disabling" policy update.

CVSSv3: 4.6 (Medium) - [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

CVE-2023-46668

# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).
