**Elastic Endpoint Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File (ESA-2023-21)**

If Elastic Endpoint (v7.9.0 - v8.10.3) is configured to use a non-default option in which the logging level is explicitly set to debug, and when Elastic Agent is simultaneously configured to collect and send those logs to Elasticsearch, then Elastic Agent API keys can be viewed in Elasticsearch in plaintext.

These API keys could be used to write arbitrary data and read Elastic Endpoint user artifacts.

**Affected Versions:**

Elastic Endpoint v7.9.0 - v8.10.3

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Upgrade to v8.10.4 or above.

For users unable to upgrade, ensure that the logging has not been set to debug.

Where debug logging has been enabled, users should purge Endpoint logs by disabling the Endpoint Security integration, waiting for Elastic Agent to apply policy, then re-enabling it. Ensure all Elastic Agents are online as any offline Agents won't receive the "disabling" policy update.

CVSSv3: 4.6 (Medium) - [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

CVE-2023-46668
