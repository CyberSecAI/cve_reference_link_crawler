The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46523.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `to_json_or_debug` function within the `mjs_json.c` file. Specifically, line 154 is identified as the source of the overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A memory safety issue where data is written beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This can lead to memory corruption, application crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application crash: The provided execution steps demonstrate a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow detected by AddressSanitizer.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities can often be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript input: The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted JavaScript string passed to the `JSON.stringify` function. Specifically the input is `(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]))((JSON.stringify - 6.5 - 321e2)(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3])));`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide input to the `mjs` interpreter. The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious javascript file through the mjs interpreter.
