- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of ordinary users in XXL-JOB to indirectly execute tasks on executors they are not assigned to. This occurs due to a flaw in how sub-task IDs are handled. Specifically, an ordinary user, who is not authorized to access a specific executor (e.g., Executor B), can trigger the execution of a task on that executor by referencing the sub-task ID of a task on Executor B when creating a new task on an executor they are authorized to access (e.g., Executor A).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is a permission bypass vulnerability. The system fails to properly restrict task execution based on user roles and executor assignments. It incorrectly allows users to execute tasks on unassigned executors by exploiting the sub-task ID functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An ordinary user can execute tasks on executors they are not authorized to access which could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or disruption of services handled by the targeted executors.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves creating a new task in the XXL-JOB system on an executor assigned to the user, and adding the sub-task ID of a task on an unauthorized executor through the advanced configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated ordinary user within the XXL-JOB system.
    - The attacker must have access to at least one executor where they can create tasks.
    - The attacker needs to know the sub-task ID of a task on an executor they are not authorized to access. This could be obtained by other means.
