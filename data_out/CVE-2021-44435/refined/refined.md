- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow while parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a maliciously crafted JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious JT file. The attacker has to prepare a malicious JT file to exploit the vulnerability.
