SSA-802578: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in JTTK before
V11.1.1.0 and JT Utilities before V13.1.1.0

Publication Date:

Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

SUMMARY

JT Open Toolkit (JTTK) before V11.1.1.0 contains multiple vulnerabilities that could be triggered when it
reads a maliciously crafted JT ﬁle. These vulnerabilities also affects JT Utilities before V13.1.1.0. If a
user is tricked to open a malicious JT ﬁle with any of the affected products, this could lead the application
to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources in the affected products.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources using JTTK

• Avoid opening untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in JT Utilities

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT is an openly published data format developed by Siemens Digital Industries Software, widely used for
communication, visualization, digital mockup and a variety of other purposes. JT has been accepted by

SSA-802578

ISO as International Standard 14306:2017. The JT Utilities provide a series of command line utilities that
can be used to support application development and JT reuse.

JT Open Toolkit (also known as JTTK) is an application programming interface (API) for developers of
JT-enabled software. The JT Open Toolkit is a read/write toolkit that enables consistent access to JT ﬁle
content.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
