- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check in a function within the "The Post Grid" WordPress plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unprivileged user could perform actions that should be limited to higher privilege levels. The specific impact would vary depending on the actions the attacker is able to perform.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable functions within the WordPress plugin that lack proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user on the WordPress site (minimum contributor).
