- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `v2_pack_array_to_msg` function within the `libv2_sdk.so` library, which is used by the `v2_sdk_service` on DJI drones. This lack of validation allows for the possibility of out-of-bounds read/write operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an Improper Input Validation leading to an out-of-bounds read/write condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a memory information leak or arbitrary code execution on the affected drone's `v2_sdk_service`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent, meaning an attacker needs to be in the same network segment or have a network path to the affected drone. The attack is triggered through a crafted payload sent to port 10000.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in an adjacent network position and have the ability to send a crafted payload to port 10000 on the vulnerable drone. The attacker also needs to have low privileges and user interaction is required.
