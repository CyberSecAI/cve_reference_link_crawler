- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin registers the `add_filter('comment_text', 'do_shortcode');` filter, which processes shortcodes within comments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated arbitrary shortcode execution, code injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary shortcodes by inserting them into a comment, potentially leading to malicious actions like data exfiltration, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution if other vulnerable plugins are installed.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a crafted comment to a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can post a comment on a vulnerable WordPress site.
