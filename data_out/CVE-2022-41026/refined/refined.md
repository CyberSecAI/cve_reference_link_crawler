```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` with format strings and command parameters without proper size checks, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to improper use of `sprintf` in command parsing.",
     "Lack of input size validation for command parameters when constructing strings."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted network packets to the device that contains the vulnerable commands through the DetranCLI interface",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. The specific user privileges required are not defined in the report but the CVSS score includes High privileges which suggests the attacker would likely require administrative rights to exploit."
