- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Ecwid Shopping Cart Plugin versions 6.12.4 and earlier lack sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a CSRF attack where a malicious actor can force an authenticated user to perform actions they didn't intend to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged in user into clicking a link or visiting a malicious page that will make the vulnerable plugin perform an unwanted action on their behalf. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
