Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-5336.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `vlan_add_commit.php` interface of the Ruijie RG-UAC Unified Internet Behavior Management Audit System. Specifically, it involves a command injection vulnerability where an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Command injection vulnerability exists in the `vlan_add_commit.php` endpoint.
- Lack of proper input sanitization allows attacker-controlled data to be passed directly to an operating system command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- Complete control of the server can be gained through command execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable `vlan_add_commit.php` interface of the application management gateway backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable web interface.
- No specific privileges are mentioned but access to the network where the management interface is exposed is required.
