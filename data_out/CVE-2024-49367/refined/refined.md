Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application allows users to control the log path for Nginx logs. This is read from the settings.
*   The application also has a directory traversal vulnerability in the `/api/configs` endpoint. This endpoint directly obtains a path from the frontend and concatenates it to the config path, making a system call without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The `/api/configs` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory by using `../` sequences.
*   **Uncontrolled Log Path:** The application allows the user to specify the log file paths, allowing an attacker to set them to arbitrary files on the system.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There's a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `dir` parameter in the `/api/configs` endpoint and log paths in settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read any file on the server's file system. This can include sensitive configuration files, application code, database credentials, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Modify Log Path:** An attacker would first modify the application settings via a `POST` request to the `/api/settings` endpoint, setting the `access_log_path` and `error_log_path` to the path of a target file.
2.  **Path Traversal:** An attacker would then craft a `GET` request to `/api/configs` with a malicious `dir` parameter, such as `../../../../Users/snake/Downloads/nginx-ui-macos-64`, to perform directory traversal and list files.
3.  **Read File:** Finally, the attacker would access the logs through `/nginx_log/access` to read the file content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application with a valid JWT token.
*   The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the nginx-ui application.
*   The attacker needs to know or guess the location of the files they wish to read.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by `@unam4`.
*   The issue is fixed in version `v2.0.0-beta.36` of `nginx-ui`.
*   The advisory provides a clear Proof of Concept (PoC) with example requests.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity.
