  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application's input fields are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Web Application Firewall (WAF) in place can be bypassed using a custom, advanced payload.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Bypassable WAF"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement of the application, or redirecting users to phishing sites.",

      "Crafting a custom, advanced JavaScript payload to bypass the WAF",
      "Submitting the malicious payload into any input field of the application."
