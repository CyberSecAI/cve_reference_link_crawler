- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Checkmk application was logging SNMP and IPMI credentials in plain text to the WATO audit log when adding, changing, or removing these credentials in host or folder properties.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive credentials (SNMP and IPMI) were being written to the audit log in clear text. This exposes the credentials if the log files are accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the log files could obtain the plaintext credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to network devices and systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing the WATO audit log files either through the WATO interface or directly on the file system where logs are stored (`~/var/check_mk/wato/log`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Checkmk system to access logs via WATO.
    - The attacker would need to have filesystem access to the Checkmk server to directly read the log files.
