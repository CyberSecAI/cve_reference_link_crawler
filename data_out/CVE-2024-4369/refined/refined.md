{
  "Root cause": "The `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` was being exposed as an environment variable within the pod definition of the cluster-image-registry-operator.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Information disclosure",
    "Exposure of sensitive data"
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with sufficient permissions to obtain pod information from the `openshift-image-registry` namespace could retrieve the `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`. This secret could then be used to perform actions as the registry operator's Azure service account.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with sufficient access to the Kubernetes API could retrieve the pod definition from the `openshift-image-registry` namespace.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account with high enough permissions to obtain pod information from the `openshift-image-registry` namespace. This is typically an internal attack scenario within the OpenShift cluster."
