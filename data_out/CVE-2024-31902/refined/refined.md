- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability, allowing an attacker to perform unwanted actions on behalf of a legitimate user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform actions on the web application on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that makes requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to perform an action (visit malicious website, click malicious link) on the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim does.
