The provided document is an Adobe Security Bulletin that details multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). Here's the breakdown for CVE-2024-36143:

**CVE-2024-36143**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site scripting (Stored XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into the application.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser session. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or perform other actions as the victim.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a malicious script, which is then stored within the application and executed when a user interacts with the affected component.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges within the application (PR:L) and the victim user needs to interact with the injected script (UI:R).  The attack vector is network based (AV:N) and the attack complexity is low (AC:L).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin lists a large number of other stored XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-26036, CVE-2024-26037, etc.) and a few other vulnerability types affecting AEM. This suggests a widespread issue with input handling.
*   The document also notes that a dependency, Spring Framework, has an open redirect vulnerability (CVE-2024-22243) affecting AEM.
*   The document provides a fix version and indicates that Cloud Service users receive automatic updates.
