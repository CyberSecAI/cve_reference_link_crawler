**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Server Privilege Gain:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain server privileges.
*   **Business Impact:** The attacker can cause significant disruption to the system.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The attacker can gain access to database sensitive information (as shown in the provided screenshot.)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers can access the vulnerable page (`/Tool/querysql.php`) via network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
