## ⚠️ Important fixes ⚠️

* [YouTube] Fix extraction of comments [TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor#1163](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/pull/1163)

  The issue happened because YouTube changed the response of comments. Note that this response doesn't return an exact like count for comments for comments with more than 999 likes, only approximate like counts.

  ℹ️ Third-party social links in descriptions and comments are now showing the accessibility text of YouTube, which is in the form `Social media name: YouTube preview text` instead of just YouTube's preview text.
* [YouTube] Restore access to some streams [TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor#1168](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/pull/1168)

  These streams are the audio streams with an average bitrate around 32 and 48 kbps (itags 139, 599, 600) and the 720p MPEG-4 muxed (video + audio) video stream on videos with musical contents (itag 22, on other contents it was still available). Note that they are not returned by YouTube on every video depending on multiple factors and they currently come from the Android YouTube app client that we use.

  Unfortunately, this client has now several integrity checks very hard or almost impossible to implement as a third-party client that we used to workaround before. The workaround shipped until 0.26.1 has been disabled by YouTube (the same one used previously by reVanced for non-root users), and the one shipped in this release is being disabled (A/B test or rollout).

  **These streams should become completely unavailable in the future and may be fully or partially restored in a future NewPipe update.**
* Fix vulnerability when importing backups [GHSA-wxrm-jhpf-vp6v](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/security/advisories/GHSA-wxrm-jhpf-vp6v "GHSA-wxrm-jhpf-vp6v")

  There is now a new format for settings stored in backups.

  The old patched format is still supported alongside the new format for backwards compatibility, but will soon be removed completely. NewPipe will show a warning when importing settings in the old format.

  **Avoid importing any backup from an untrusted source (e.g. a GitHub issue) if it shows this warning!**

## ⚠️ Known issues/regressions which are not fixed with this update ⚠️

**DO NOT OPEN NEW ISSUES FOR THEM BUT FOLLOW THE LINKED ONES INSTEAD!**

* [YouTube] Avatars, banners and subscriber count are unavailable on channels sometimes: a YouTube A/B test or rollout changes the channel header UI, which is currently unsupported by the extractor. See [#10826](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/10826) for more details.
