- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read due to a race condition in `imgsys`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Out-of-bounds read, race condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker, requires system execution privileges, user interaction is needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have system execution privileges and the ability to interact with the system in a way that triggers the race condition.
