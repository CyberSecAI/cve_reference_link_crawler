### Summary:
The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Void Contact Form 7 Widget For Elementor Page Builder" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 2.4. The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied input in the `cf7_redirect_page` attribute within the plugin's widget.

### Root cause of vulnerability:
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied input, specifically the `cf7_redirect_page` attribute. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through the widget settings.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input before storing and displaying it.

### Impact of exploitation:
- **Arbitrary script execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- **Compromise user sessions:** When a user views the affected page, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Website takeover:**  If an administrator accesses the injected page, the attacker could potentially gain control of the website.

### Attack vectors:
- **Plugin widget:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts through the "Void Contact Form 7" widget's settings via the `cf7_redirect_page` attribute.
- **Authentication required:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
- **WordPress account:** The attacker must have a WordPress account with at least "Contributor" level privileges.
- **Widget access:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the settings of the "Void Contact Form 7" widget in Elementor page builder.
- **Malicious script:** The attacker must have a malicious JavaScript payload ready to inject.

### Additional details
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.1 by changing the input type for the redirect URL from `TEXT` to `URL` and by escaping the URL on output.
