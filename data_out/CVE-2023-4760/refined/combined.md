If the filename contains mixture of Unix and Windows separators the filename is not stripped correctly.

Use exiting Apache Commons API for getting the file name.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# rt.rap: RCE on RAP File Upload

Reported by [@melazrak](/melazrak "Mehdi EL AZRAK") at the Security mailing list

## Basic information

**Project name:** Eclipse RAP

**Project id:** rt.rap

## What are the affected versions?

Not communicated

## Details of the issue

I noticed a security issue on org.eclipse.rap.fileupload component and I would like to inform you about it.
According to your Security Policy I tried to report vulnerabilities using the Eclipse Foundation's Bugzilla instance but when I created a new account I was asked to have at least one active component in order for me to enter a bug into the product Community.
So I am reporting it to you via email.

Remote Code Execution is possible on Windows due to improper filename sanitization for features relying on servicehandler=org.eclipse.rap.fileupload mechanism.
A partial sanitization of the filename name is done in the stripFileName method. When this method finds a / it removes everything before but keeps the potential \s.
So for the filename "/....\webapps\shell.war" the stripFileName method keeps "....\webapps\shell.war".

Proof when running an app using RAP Fileupload on a Tomcat Server on Windows
[![image](data:image/gif;base64...)](/-/project/3804/uploads/819897b7d0598e7b7aae84e05fdc44e8/image.png)

The file is saved on webapps folder

Please feel free to ask for more details if needed.

## Steps to reproduce

See above

## Do you know any mitigations of the issue?

Not communicated

Reported on: August 28, 2023

To upload designs, you'll need to enable LFS and have an admin enable hashed storage. [More information](/help/user/project/issues/design_management.md#prerequisites)
