- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of SCP and SFTP CLI input parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to the ability to create or overwrite files in a system directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impact the functionality of the device, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition, and the device may need to be manually rebooted to recover.
- **Attack vectors:** Authenticated local user using SCP or SFTP CLI commands with specific parameters. A user with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs valid user credentials to authenticate to the device and must be able to issue SCP or SFTP CLI commands.
