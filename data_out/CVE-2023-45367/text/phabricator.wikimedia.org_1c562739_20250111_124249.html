# Description

When sending client hints data, the brands and fullVersionList fields are a list. Each member of these lists is inserted as a separate row in the cu\_useragent\_clienthints table.

There does not seem to be a limit to the number of items a user can put in these lists. I was able to submit a client hints request with 10000 entries in both of these fields, and 20000 rows were inserted in to the database.

This could be a possible vector for denial of service.

##### Reproduction

1. Setup a wiki with CheckUser and enable client hints (they are enabled by default, you shouldn't need to do anything)
2. Make an edit in Firefox (which does not support client hints)
3. Find out the revision ID of the edit you just made
4. Run this command, changing <rev id> to the revision ID you just found. You might need to change the address of the server as well:

```
curl 'http://localhost:8080/w/rest.php/checkuser/v0/useragent-clienthints/revision/<rev id>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"architecture":"","bitness":"64","brands":[{"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "0"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "1"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "2"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "3"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "4"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "5"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "6"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "7"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "8"}, {"brand": "Test Brand", "version": "9"}],"fullVersionList":[{"brand": "Test Version", "version": "0"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "1"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "2"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "3"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "4"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "5"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "6"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "7"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "8"}, {"brand": "Test Version", "version": "9"}],"mobile":false,"model":"","platform":"Linux","platformVersion":"5.10.0"}'
```

5. Go to the database and run SELECT \* FROM cu\_useragent\_clienthints;

##### Other information

Only wmf and the master branch of CheckUser has this issue. There will be no need to keep this private after the patch is in production as only local testing wikis should have this issue until it's merged into the master branch.

I will write a patch.

There are a few ways to get this fixed that I can see:

1. Disable collection of Client Hints globally until this is fixed (and then a fix can be written normally)
2. Temporarily disable collection, deploy a security patch and then re-enable collection.
3. Deploy a security patch without disabling collection

Is there a SAL entry for this? I couldn't find an obvious one. Also now tracking at T276237 and [T340874](/T340874).

No, I don't see one.

[@sbassett](/p/sbassett/) are we OK to proceed with creating a patch in Gerrit for this, and making this task public?

Yes, that's fine. Once an issue is patched in Wikimedia production and if it doesn't belong to [a bundled component](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Bundled_extensions_and_skins), then it can be disclosed and backported. We'll disclose it again via the end-of-quarter supplemental security release as well ([T340874](/T340874)).

The vulnerability has only existed in the master and wmf branches, so not sure if it needs to be backported when making the fix public as no release versions included it. This may also mean that it doesn't need to be stated in the end-of-quarter supplemental security release as the fix would not be included in any of these releases (due to the vulnerability not existing in any release version).

So at the very least there should be a public backport to master or main for any security patch, which I see you've now done in [c952482](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/952482). If the patch is not relevant for [other supported release branches](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Version_lifecycle#Versions_and_their_end-of-life), then no further effort needs to be expended in backporting it to said branches. I'll go ahead and make this task public now as well.

I had assumed that the name "backport" applied only to patches not on the master branch. My intended meaning was that it didn't need to be cherry picked to other branches from the master branch.

This has been merged into the master branch, so should be in wmf.24. As such I presume it is safe to ignore this for wmf.24.

[@mmartorana](/p/mmartorana/) it seems that that CVE number has an incorrect description. This security issue was never present in any mediawki release. Could the CVE be updated? Thanks.

CVEs can be updated via <https://cveform.mitre.org/>, with the "Request an update to an existing CVE Entry" option. However such updates can take several weeks or even months.
