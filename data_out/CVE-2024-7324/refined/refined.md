{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application, `IDRBackup.exe`, loads a BPL file, `madbasic_.bpl`, from the same directory. This uncontrolled search path allows a malicious user to place a crafted BPL file in the same directory as the executable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uncontrolled search path leading to BPL sideloading.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged-in user.",
  "Attack vectors": "By placing a malicious `madbasic_.bpl` file in the same directory as `IDRBackup.exe`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to place a malicious BPL file in the same directory as the vulnerable executable."
