The provided content includes information about CVE-2023-45159.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 1E Client installer does not properly handle symbolic links or Windows junctions during the cleanup of temporary directories used during service startup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'). The vulnerability stems from the installerâ€™s failure to validate symbolic links or junctions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A non-privileged user can achieve arbitrary file deletion on protected files, potentially leading to system instability or data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
A local, non-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link or Windows junction pointing to a protected directory, which will then be deleted by the 1E Client during service startup.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a non-privileged local user with the ability to create symbolic links or junctions on the system.
