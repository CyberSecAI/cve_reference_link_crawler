- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user (subscriber) can execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly stated, but it involves exploiting a function without proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (unprivileged user)
