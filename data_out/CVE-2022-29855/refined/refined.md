{
  "CVE-2022-29855": {
    "Description": "An access control vulnerability has been identified in Mitel 6800 Series SIP Phones and 6900 Series SIP phones (excluding the 6970) running SIP firmware. If successfully exploited could allow a malicious actor access to code execution.",
    "Root cause": "An undocumented backdoor was discovered in the firmware of Mitel 6800 and 6900 series SIP phones (excluding 6970).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The presence of an undocumented function (backdoor) which grants root access through a specific key combination during system boot.",
      "Use of a hardcoded password for the root user.",
      "Insecure access control that allows for unauthorized code execution."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root access to the affected phone, which can lead to full system compromise and code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the phone is required, as the vulnerability is triggered by pressing specific keys during the phone's boot process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have physical access to the phone and be able to press the '*' and '#' keys simultaneously during startup. No specific network access is required to trigger the vulnerability."
