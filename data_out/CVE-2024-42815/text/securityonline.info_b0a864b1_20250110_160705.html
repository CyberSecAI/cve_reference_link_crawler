# CVE-2024-42815 (CVSS 9.8): Buffer Overflow Flaw in TP-Link Routers Opens Door to RCE

A critical vulnerability has been found in TP-Link RE365 V1\_180213 series routers, leaving them susceptible to remote exploitation and potential takeover. Identified as CVE-2024-42815 and carrying a near-perfect CVSS score of 9.8, this flaw poses a serious risk to users of these popular networking devices.

The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow issue in the router’s HTTP server. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long “User-Agent” header, attackers can trigger a buffer overflow, potentially crashing the device or, more alarmingly, executing malicious code on it.

The vulnerability [resides](https://gist.github.com/XiaoCurry/14d46e0becd79d9bb9907f2fbe147cfe) in the `httpRpmWmbParse` function within the `/usr/bin/httpd` binary, specifically linked to how the router handles the `USER_AGENT` field in HTTP GET requests. The issue arises due to the absence of length verification for the `USER_AGENT` field, which is passed unchecked to the `PRINTF_ECHO` function. This function, in turn, concatenates the `USER_AGENT` content into a format string using the `vsprintf` function, storing the result in a variable named `v3`.

Because there is no safeguard on the length of data that can be entered into the `USER_AGENT` field, attackers can exploit this weakness by sending a specially crafted GET request with an excessively long `USER_AGENT` header. The result is a buffer overflow, which can cause the router to crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS) or even allowing the execution of arbitrary commands on the device.

The implications of CVE-2024-42815 are severe. By leveraging this vulnerability, a remote attacker could effectively disrupt the normal operation of the affected router, rendering it unusable through a targeted DoS attack. More concerning, however, is the possibility of executing arbitrary commands on the device, which could lead to a complete compromise of the router and the network it supports. Such an exploit could open the door to further attacks, including data exfiltration, network surveillance, and the propagation of malware.

TP-Link has [released](https://www.tp-link.com/uk/support/download/re365/v3/) a patch for this vulnerability. Users are strongly advised to upgrade firmware immediately.
