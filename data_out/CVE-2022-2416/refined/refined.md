- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists due to a flaw in how Octopus Server handles user-crafted requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SSRF, which allows for enumeration/reconnaissance of an environment.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can use this vulnerability to enumerate and recon an environment. This typically means scanning the internal network, identifying services, and collecting information that might be useful in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by a low-privileged guest user crafting a specific request to the Octopus Server. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged guest user account is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Octopus Server.
