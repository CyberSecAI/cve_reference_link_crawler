Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The APM Server, when encountering an error while indexing a document in Elasticsearch, logs the Elasticsearch response at the ERROR level. This response includes parts of the original document that failed to be indexed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of potentially sensitive data within the error logs. This occurs because the Elasticsearch response, logged by APM Server, may contain fragments of the original document that failed indexing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive or private information present in the documents processed by the APM server. This information could be anything from personal data, API keys, or other confidential material.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Error Logging:** The vulnerability is triggered when indexing fails, causing the APM server to log the error response including parts of the original document, which exposes sensitive data via the logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to APM Server Logs:**  An attacker needs to gain access to the APM Server logs where the sensitive information is being recorded.
- **Privileged access to logs:** The CVSS score indicates low privileges required, so any user with access to the logs can read this sensitive data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix is to upgrade to APM Server version 8.12.1 or later.
- The provided information includes a search string (`Preview of field's value:`) which can be used to identify potential instances of sensitive information leaks within the APM Server logs.
- The vulnerability is rated as Medium severity with a CVSSv3 score of 5.7 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). This score indicates that the attack vector is adjacent, the attack complexity is low, low privileges are required and there is high confidentiality impact.
