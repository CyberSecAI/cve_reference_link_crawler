- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation or other malicious activity. In this specific case, the proof of concept demonstrates a time-based SQL injection by injecting a `sleep(20)` command which causes a noticeable delay in the server response.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `fpd_get_products` action, with a malicious `filter_by` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated administrator to exploit this vulnerability.
