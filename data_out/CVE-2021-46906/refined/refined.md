Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46906

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `hid_submit_ctrl()` function within the Linux kernel's Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem, specifically when handling USB HID devices. The calculation of the transfer buffer length for control transfers did not properly account for HID reports with a size of zero (`report->size == 0`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Size Calculation:** The original code used `((report->size - 1) >> 3) + 1 + (report->id > 0)` to determine the length of the HID report, which could result in a large, incorrect length calculation if `report->size` was zero.
- **Information Leak:**  When a zero-sized report was submitted, the incorrect calculation resulted in allocating an oversized transfer buffer of 16384 bytes. Because the actual report was smaller or even empty, the USB core layer would then transfer the larger allocated buffer, leaking kernel memory contents to the USB device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:**  An attacker could potentially leak up to 16384 bytes of kernel memory to a USB device via a crafted HID report. This leaked data might contain sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious HID Device:** An attacker can craft a malicious USB HID device that sends HID reports with `report->size` set to zero.
- **Manipulated HID Reports:** In a compromised system, the attacker may manipulate HID reports to achieve the zero-size condition in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Physical Access:** Physical access to the target system to connect the malicious HID device would be required for the primary attack vector.
- **Root/Kernel Level Privileges:** Alternatively, if the attacker has achieved root privileges or has compromised the kernel in some way, they could trigger the vulnerability through software means.

**Additional Details:**
- **Syzkaller:** The vulnerability was initially discovered using the syzkaller kernel fuzzer.
- **Fix:** The fix involves modifying the `hid_report_len()` function to use `DIV_ROUND_UP(report->size, 8)` to correctly calculate the report length, handling the case where `report->size` is zero.  The `hid_submit_ctrl()` function now calls the corrected `hid_report_len()` function to determine the transfer buffer size.
