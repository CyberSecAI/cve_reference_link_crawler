**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Expired user accounts were still able to authenticate via PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of expired user account status during authentication. The system failed to correctly check if an account was expired before allowing login through PAM.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with previously valid but now expired credentials could potentially regain access to the system, which could lead to unauthorized access and potential manipulation of the corosync and pacemaker configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the system using an expired username and password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must possess valid credentials that have since expired.
- Needs network access to attempt the login.
