The provided content describes path traversal vulnerabilities affecting multiple CData products when deployed using the embedded Jetty server.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
1. How the embedded Jetty server processes servlet mappings and security constraints defined in the `web.xml` configuration files, which allows attackers to bypass intended security restrictions.
2. Jetty's acceptance of `\` characters in URIs, which other servers like Tomcat reject, combined with the CData servlets correctly processing these URIs.
3.  Lack of explicit session checks on some endpoints within CData applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use `..` sequences and backslashes in URIs to access files and resources outside of the intended web application directory.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** Lack of proper session checks allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive endpoints that should be restricted to authenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact varies per product:
*   **CData API Server and CData Connect:** Unauthenticated remote attackers can gain complete administrative access to the application.
*   **CData Arc and CData Sync:** Unauthenticated remote attackers can gain access to sensitive information and perform limited actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests with path traversal sequences in the URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable CData application.
*   No prior authentication or user privileges are needed.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to the Java versions of CData products when deployed using the embedded Jetty server.
*   A proof-of-concept is provided, demonstrating how to access the `getSettings.rsb` endpoint, which can leak sensitive data.
*   The advisory lists affected products and their respective vulnerable versions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by a researcher at Tenable.
*   CData has released updates to mitigate the issue.
