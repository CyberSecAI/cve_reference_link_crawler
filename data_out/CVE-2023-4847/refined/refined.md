        "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"

        "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user input in the 'delete' parameter in `delete_book.php`, which is then used in a SQL query and in `unlink`, leading to SQL Injection and potential Path Traversal.",

            "By crafting a malicious SQL query within the delete parameter of the `delete_book.php` URL request." ,
