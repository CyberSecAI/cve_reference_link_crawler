Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** XXE (XML External Entity) Injection

**Root Cause:** The `ebookmeta.get_metadata()` function, when used with `lxml` versions less than `4.9.1` and `ebookmeta` versions less than `1.2.8`, is vulnerable to XXE injection. This is likely due to insecure processing of XML input where external entities are not properly disabled.

**Weaknesses:**
- Improper XML parsing
- Failure to disable external entities by default

**Impact:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive information from the server's filesystem by crafting malicious XML payloads that include external entities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to supply a crafted XML file to the vulnerable `ebookmeta.get_metadata()` function.
- The attacker could be able to trigger a function using an XML file they upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to pass a malicious XML file to the vulnerable function.
- Attacker needs the `ebookmeta` version to be less than `1.2.8` and the `lxml` version to be less than `4.9.1`.
