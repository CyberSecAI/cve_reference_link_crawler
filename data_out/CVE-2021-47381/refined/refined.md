The provided content relates to a fix for a bug in the Linux kernel's sound subsystem, specifically in the SOF (Sound Open Firmware) driver for Xtensa architecture. This fix is associated with commit `ac4dfccb96571ca03af7cac64b7a0b2952c97f3a` which was backported in commit `a6bb576ead074ca6fa3b53cb1c5d4037a23de81b`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect usage of the `hex_dump_to_buffer()` function and an incorrect stack address calculation in the `xtensa_stack()` function of the `sound/soc/sof/xtensa/core.c` file. The `hex_dump_to_buffer()` function was given an incorrect offset when accessing the stack data, leading to incorrect data being displayed in the stack dump. Additionally, the stack address printed in the error message was calculated incorrectly leading to a wrong stack address in the output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect memory access in the `hex_dump_to_buffer()` function call which could potentially lead to reading out-of-bounds memory or reading the same memory region multiple times.
- Incorrect stack address displayed in error output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability does not lead to a direct exploitable security impact. However, the incorrect stack dumps can hinder debugging and error analysis during a DSP crash. An incorrect stack dump can make it harder to pinpoint the actual root cause of a DSP error.

**Attack vectors:**
Not applicable. This is not a remotely exploitable or privilege escalation vulnerability. It's a bug in a debugging/error handling function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Not applicable. This bug does not require any attacker capabilities or specific positions.
