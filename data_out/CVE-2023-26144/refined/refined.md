Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26144:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from inefficient processing within the `OverlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule` in `graphql-js` when handling large GraphQL queries with many repeated fields. This rule is responsible for validating that fields with the same name can be merged without conflict.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Performance Degradation:** The inefficient implementation of the `OverlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule` leads to excessive CPU usage and increased processing times when parsing large queries with numerous repeated fields (e.g., many `__typename` fields).
- **Resource Exhaustion:**  The excessive processing time can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by exhausting server resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious GraphQL query with a large number of repeated fields that will cause a significant performance degradation on the server, potentially making the service unavailable for legitimate users.
- **Increased Response Times:** Legitimate requests may experience longer processing times and become slow due to the resource consumption by the malicious query.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious GraphQL Queries:** An attacker can send a specially crafted GraphQL query containing a large number of repeated fields to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send GraphQL queries to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `5caff03` via pull request #3457 and fixed in commit `f94b511` via pull request #3958.
- The fix involves optimizing the comparison of arguments within the `OverlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule`.
- The vulnerability affects `graphql-js` versions >= 16.3.0 and < 16.8.1.
- Version 16.8.1 was released to address this issue.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is available, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a GraphQL query with a large number of `__typename` fields.

**Summary of Changes:**

The primary change is in `src/validation/rules/OverlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule.ts`, specifically the `sameArguments` function. The original implementation used string comparison of printed arguments, which was inefficient. The fix uses a more direct value comparison of arguments. Additionally the `stringifyArguments` was updated to sort arguments before printing, as the order should not matter.
