Are we able to get this in asap? This impacts all consumers unless they have some kind of mitigation in place (which Apollo doesn't do by itself) which I found to be the case about <30% of the time when testing a bunch of different companies

Q: should this be disclosed as a vulnerability? it's already public but consumers should upgrade asap
