- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow when parsing the certificate length field during the processing of client certificates. The process does not properly validate user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data related to certificate length.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malicious client certificate.
