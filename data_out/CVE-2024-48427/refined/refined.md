Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-48427

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `/mpms/admin/?page=services/manage_service` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing the attacker to manipulate database queries through the vulnerable `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete system compromise.
* **Database Dump:** An attacker can dump the entire database content using tools like SQLMap.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
* **Manipulated `id` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or staff member to access the `/mpms/admin` panel.
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send the malicious request.
* **Basic Web Security Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection vulnerabilities and how to craft SQL payloads.

**Summary of Attack Steps:**
1. **Log in:** The attacker logs into the application's admin panel using valid credentials.
2. **Navigate to vulnerable page:** The attacker accesses the vulnerable endpoint: `/mpms/admin/?page=services/manage_service&id=2`.
3. **Inject SQL Payload:** The attacker modifies the URL by injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter: `/mpms/admin/?page=services/manage_service&id=1' OR SLEEP(5)-- puNr`.
4. **Observe Response:**  The attacker confirms successful injection by observing the applicationâ€™s response time; a delay of 5 seconds in the example.
5. **Database Dump:** The attacker uses an automated tool like SQLMap to exploit the vulnerability and dump the entire database content using the provided command `sqlmap -u "http://localhost/mpms/admin/?page=services/manage_service&id=1" --cookie="phpMyAdmin=ju34bd3d8q0jdf6td4ntqscaqd;PHPSESSID=eopn8q1p8c1f5m1v5igjoir8k1;" --dbms mysql -p id --risk 3 --level 4 --dbs --dump`.
