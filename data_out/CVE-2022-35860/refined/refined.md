  "summary": "The provided documents discuss vulnerabilities in wireless keyboards. A master's thesis titled \"Penetration testing wireless keyboards: Are your devices vulnerable?\" details the analysis of 10 different keyboards, finding 8 of them to have vulnerabilities that allow for both keystroke sniffing and injection. The research found that wireless keyboards should not be used in situations where sensitive information is handled. The study was conducted by Niklas Tomsic at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.",
