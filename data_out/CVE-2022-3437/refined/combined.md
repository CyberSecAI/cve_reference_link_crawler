## CVE-2022-3437.html:

```

===========================================================
== Subject:     Buffer overflow in Heimdal unwrap_des3()
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2022-3437
==
== Versions:    All versions of Samba since Samba 4.0 compiled
==              with Heimdal Kerberos
==
== Summary:     There is a limited write heap buffer overflow
==              in the GSSAPI unwrap_des() and unwrap_des3()
==              routines of Heimdal (included in Samba).
===========================================================

===========
Description
===========

The DES (for Samba 4.11 and earlier) and Triple-DES decryption
routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library allow a length-limited write
buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a
maliciously small packet.

Examples of where Samba can use GSSAPI include the client and
fileserver for SMB1 (unix extensions), DCE/RPC in all use cases and
LDAP in the Active Directory Domain Controller.

However not all Samba installations are impacted!  Samba is often
compiled to use the system MIT Kerberos using the
--with-system-mitkrb5 argument and these installations are not
impacted, as the vulnerable code is not compiled into Samba.

However when, as is the default, Samba is compiled to use the internal
Heimdal Kerberos library the vulnerable unwrap_des3() is used.

(The single-DES use case, along with the equally vulnerable
unwrap_des() is only compiled into Samba 4.11 and earlier).

The primary use of Samba's internal Heimdal is for the Samba AD DC,
but this vulnerability does impact fileserver deployments built with
the default build options.

==================
Patch Availability
==================

Patches addressing both these issues have been posted to:

    https://www.samba.org/samba/security/

Additionally, Samba 4.15.11, 4.16.6 and 4.17.2 have been issued
as security releases to correct the defect.  Samba administrators are
advised to upgrade to these releases or apply the patch as soon
as possible.

==================

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L (5.9)

==========
Workaround
==========

Compiling Samba with --with-system-mitkrb5 will avoid this issue.

Subject: [vs] heimdal: CVE-2022-45142: signature validation failure

Hi,

I am hereby publishing a vulnerability in heimdal backports by attaching
the exact mail sent to distros@...openwall.org last week.

Subject: [vs] heimdal: CVE-2022-45142: signature validation failure

(Resent with proper subject tag)

CVE-2022-3437 was a vulnerability affecting heimdal and samba. It was
fixed in both places. The fix included changing memcmp to be constant
time and a workaround for a compiler bug by adding "!= 0" comparisons to
the result of memcmp. When these patches were backported to the
heimdal-7.7.1 and heimdal-7.8.0 branches (and possibly other branches) a
logic inversion sneaked in causing the validation of message integrity
codes in gssapi/arcfour to be inverted.

This vulnerability does not affect samba nor the main heimdal branch and
only applies to backports. At least the 7.7.1 and 7.8.0 branches are
affected. CVE-2022-45142 has been assigned. All releases of Debian are
affected. At least one release of Fedora and Ubuntu are affected.

From: Helmut Grohne <helmut@...divi.de>
Subject: [PATCH v3] CVE-2022-45142: gsskrb5: fix accidental logic inversions

The referenced commit attempted to fix miscompilations with gcc-9 and
gcc-10 by changing `memcmp(...)` to `memcmp(...) != 0`. Unfortunately,
it also inverted the result of the comparison in two occasions. This
inversion happened during backporting the patch to 7.7.1 and 7.8.0.

## CVE-2022-3437.html:

```

===========================================================
== Subject:     Buffer overflow in Heimdal unwrap_des3()
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2022-3437
==
== Versions:    All versions of Samba since Samba 4.0 compiled
==              with Heimdal Kerberos
==
== Summary:     There is a limited write heap buffer overflow
==              in the GSSAPI unwrap_des() and unwrap_des3()
==              routines of Heimdal (included in Samba).
===========================================================

===========
Description
===========

The DES (for Samba 4.11 and earlier) and Triple-DES decryption
routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library allow a length-limited write
buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a
maliciously small packet.

Examples of where Samba can use GSSAPI include the client and
fileserver for SMB1 (unix extensions), DCE/RPC in all use cases and
LDAP in the Active Directory Domain Controller.

However not all Samba installations are impacted!  Samba is often
compiled to use the system MIT Kerberos using the
--with-system-mitkrb5 argument and these installations are not
impacted, as the vulnerable code is not compiled into Samba.

However when, as is the default, Samba is compiled to use the internal
Heimdal Kerberos library the vulnerable unwrap_des3() is used.

(The single-DES use case, along with the equally vulnerable
unwrap_des() is only compiled into Samba 4.11 and earlier).

The primary use of Samba's internal Heimdal is for the Samba AD DC,
but this vulnerability does impact fileserver deployments built with
the default build options.

==================
Patch Availability
==================

Patches addressing both these issues have been posted to:

    https://www.samba.org/samba/security/

Additionally, Samba 4.15.11, 4.16.6 and 4.17.2 have been issued
as security releases to correct the defect.  Samba administrators are
advised to upgrade to these releases or apply the patch as soon
as possible.

==================
CVSSv3 calculation
==================

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L (5.9)

==========
Workaround
==========

Compiling Samba with --with-system-mitkrb5 will avoid this issue.
