## 4. MITIGATIONS

The iSTAR Pro controller has reached its end-of-support period and no further firmware updates will be provided. However, the iSTAR Pro has a physical dip switch located on its GCM board, labeled S4, that can be configured to block out communications to the ICU tool. Please consult the iSTAR Pro Installation and Configuration Guide for more details on how to set the dip switch to mitigate this vulnerability.

For more detailed mitigation instructions, please see [Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2024-06 v1](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/cyber-solutions/security-advisories)

Aligning with CISA recommendations, Johnson Controls recommends taking steps to minimize risks to all building automation systems.

CISA provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS web page on us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with defense-in-depth strategies.

Further ICS security notices and product security guidance are located at [Johnson Controls product security website](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/cyber-solutions/security-advisories)
Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
