Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3549:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `iesfootprint.jsp` file of Oracle E-Business Suite.
- The code constructs a SQL query by directly concatenating user-supplied parameters (`dscriptId`, `deployDate`, `responseDate`) into the query string without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is the direct injection of untrusted user input into a SQL query, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-supplied parameters before including them in the SQL query.
- **Dynamic SQL Construction:** The use of string concatenation to build the SQL query, rather than using parameterized queries, makes it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker may gain unauthorized access to information or operations that they wouldn't normally have access to.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Parameters:** The attack vector is through manipulating the HTTP GET parameters, specifically `dscriptId`, `deployDate`, and `responseDate` within the `iesfootprint.jsp` page.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the affected Oracle E-Business Suite application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit is possible without any authentication, which significantly increases the risk. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and the structure of the SQL queries used in the application. However, the provided example PoC shows the required request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Oracle E-Business Suite version 12.2.3.
- The vulnerability is classified as "high" risk.
- The `iesfootprint.jsp` page is the specific vulnerable component.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to inject SQL via the `dscriptId` parameter.
- The vulnerability is fixed in the Oracle CPU April 2017 patch update.
