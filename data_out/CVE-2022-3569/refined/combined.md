## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Start `msfconsole`
* Get a session as the `zimbra` user somehow (I used `exploit/linux/http/zimbra_cpio_cve_2022_41352`, which isn't merged yet, but any way to get a shell is fine)
* `use exploit/linux/local/zimbra_postfix_priv_esc`
* `set SESSION <session>`
* `exploit`
* Should give you root!

```

## Instructions for installing Zimbra

(Adapted from [@cdelafuente-r7](https://github.com/cdelafuente-r7)'s original install way back like two months ago)

Create a VM

```
HDD = 128gb
Memory/etc don't matter

```

I installed a local DNS server (note: replace `<ip>` with the host's actual ip) (other note: replace `apt` with `yum` to do this on a Red Hat-derived system):

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install dnsmasq
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname mail.example.org
echo "<ip> mail.example.org" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo -e 'listen-address=127.0.0.1\nserver=8.8.8.8\ndomain=example.org\nmx-host=example.org, mail.example.org, 5\nmx-host=mail.example.org, mail.example.org, 5' | sudo tee /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```

Configure the host to use it:

```
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo killall dnsmasq
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf

```

Download Zimbra from <https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration-open-source/> - you'll have to sell your soul and opt-in to spam, but they don't validate your email.

```
tar -xvvzf zcs-*.tgz
cd zcs*
sudo ./install.sh

* Lots of <enter>
* DO NOT install `dnscache` module (respond `N` when it ask), I had conflict issues with the local `dnsmasq`
* Yes change the system
* Setup the admin password, probably turn off auto-updates

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

This should be moved to a separate section `## Scenarios` below `## Options`. This [template](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/module_doc_template.md) shows details about each required section.

I'm never 100% sure what the difference is between `Verification` and `Scenarios`, especially for modules that you just set LHOST/RHOSTS and run, but I tried to separate it out and added my Zimbra-installation steps in case that helps.

The installation steps are definitely a good idea, thanks for adding them.

`Verification Steps` is where you add the steps for whoever will review/test the module. It is usually generic information in this format:

1. Install the application
2. Start msfconsole
3. Do: `use [module path]`
4. Do: `set RHOSTS <remote IP>`
5. Do: `run`
6. You should get a shell.

`Scenarios` contains a real example with the console output. It can contain multiple examples if you want to demonstrate how the module behaves according to the target OS, ACTION setting, PAYLOAD type etc.

This template is a good starting point: <https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/module_doc_template.md>

Just adding a note here as a placeholder to add the CVE number once it is out. Also, once it is fixed, adding the fixed version to the documentation and module description would be great.

I dunno if this will get a CVE number, unless we mint one ourselves. Maybe I'll ask Tod to make one :)

| Release Notes This adds a new module to exploit a vulnerable sudo configuration in Zimbra that permits the `zimbra` user to execute `postfix` as root. In turn, `postfix` can execute arbitrary shell scripts and get command execution as the root user. Currently, as of 2022-10-14, all versions of Zimbra are vulnerable. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
