- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VAPIX APIs `local_list.cgi`, `create_overlay.cgi`, and `irissetup.cgi` are vulnerable to file globbing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: File globbing vulnerability in specific VAPIX APIs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Resource exhaustion attack.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation of vulnerable VAPIX APIs (`local_list.cgi`, `create_overlay.cgi`, and `irissetup.cgi`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable VAPIX APIs.
