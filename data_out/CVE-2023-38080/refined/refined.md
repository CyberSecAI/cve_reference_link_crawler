Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing PDF files. Specifically, the application copies this user-supplied data to a fixed-length heap-based buffer without checking if the data exceeds the buffer's capacity.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file that contains oversized data.
    *   User interaction is required: the victim must open the malicious PDF file using Kofax Power PDF.
