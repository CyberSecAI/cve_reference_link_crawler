The provided content is related to CVE-2024-26469.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the `url` parameter in the `ProductDesignerPixabayModuleFrontController::postProcess` method within the "Product Designer" module for PrestaShop. This allows an attacker to manipulate the URL and force the server to make requests to arbitrary locations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - CWE-918

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can initiate HTTP requests from the vulnerable server to other websites.
- The vulnerable website can be used as a proxy to attack other websites.
- Data from files under IP restrictions can be exfiltrated.
- Path traversal attacks can be performed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack (HTTP request).
- The vulnerability is reachable via a PrestaShop front controller which can be concealed during the attack, making it harder to detect in conventional frontend logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges, and no user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
