# AdGuard for Windows – Release – AdGuard versions

[AdGuard for Windows 7.19
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71948530)
Release date: October 24, 2024

Rolling in like that quirky relative who always brings the best presents, here’s version v7.19 for you! With it, you can share your settings via link, enjoy fancy userstyles, log in in a new way, and say goodbye to nasty bugs.
Before you dive in, we have some important news: this is the last release to support Windows 7. Why?
We use several libraries for our work, the latest versions of which no longer support Windows 7. And the latest versions are necessary — both for user safety and for the overall functionality of the app.
If upgrading to a newer version of Windows isn’t possible, please stick with version 7.19.

Now, onto the features.
## Sharing settings

We believe that sharing is caring, so we’ve introduced a new feature that lets you share your settings via a link. If you’ve got everything set up perfectly in your desktop app, just scan the QR code to transfer those settings to your mobile app. Or share the link with friends — spread the ~~love~~settings!
## Adding style to your browsing

Want a dark theme on a website that doesn’t have one? With userstyles, it’s possible!
Userstyles are custom themes that allow you to change how web pages look in your browser without modifying their content. They work by adding CSS styles to the website’s existing styles.

To add a userstyle, go to Settings → Extensions → Add → Import from file or URL. Feeling creative? Click Add → Create userstyle. You can find [ready-made userstyles online](https://userstyles.world/). Once you install one, just open your browser, and voilà — it’s all styled up.
![Adding extension *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/windows/v7.19/choosing_extensions.png)
## Logging in a new way

Now, when you select Log in with email, you’ll be taken to a browser to sign in to the app and your AdGuard account. Not so convenient at first, but you can put a password manager to use — enable autocomplete in your browser and you won’t have to enter your login info every time. Plus, it makes it easier for us to maintain the service, which means we’ll be able to respond more quickly if something goes wrong.
You can also opt for one-time codes. We’ll send you a code to your email, and you’ll never have to worry about remembering your password again.
![Login screen *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/windows/v7.19/web_signin_en.png)
## Last but not least

You know that list of settings on the left side of the app? Well, we’re updating their names to make it clearer what they actually do. So Stealth Mode becomes Tracking protection. Makes sense, since it doesn’t make you literally invisible, but it does protect you from being tracked.
Every new version comes with bug fixes, some bigger than others. Like the BSoD issue, which is quite annoying. We did our best to fix it, and with updated WFP and TDI network drivers, everything works as it should.
We also updated the Scriptlets, the DnsLibs, so you can count on quality filtering and clean, safe browsing.

Release date: July 4, 2024

Let’s start with great news for all Windows 11 users: AdGuard now blocks the ads that Microsoft started incorporating into the Start menu on Windows 11. This feature can be enabled from the Ad Blocker tab of the settings.
Back to fighting more ‘conventional’ ads: we have updated the CoreLibs filtering engine, along with other components. With these updates, we have introduced new modifiers and scriptlets that will help filter developers create better and more powerful filtering rules against ads and trackers. As a bonus, there will be less crashes now! You can be sure that AdGuard will protect you at all times without fail.
But the good news doesn’t stop there! We have also updated our network drivers to improve AdGuard’s compatibility with other network-based apps.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.17.2
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71747120)
Release date: July 1, 2024

Here’s an additional technical update following the previous one. In it, we’ve fixed bugs and kept working on the app stability.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.17.1
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71747090)
Release date: April 22, 2024

In this patch, we’ve focused on addressing two critical issues. First, we have fixed a major bug that occurred in the filtering engine, CoreLibs. Second, after installing AdGuard v7.17 for Windows, the application would crash if you put the word in quotation marks in the Exclude app from filtering by entering the full path option. We’ve fixed it and also updated DnsLibs, along the way.
## Changelog

### Fixes

Quotation marks in Exclude app from filtering option prevent AdGuard from working [#5087](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/5087)
### CoreLibs (Filtering engine)

CoreLibs updated to v1.14.53 [#5092](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/5092)
### DnsLibs (DNS filtering engine)

DnsLibs updated to v2.5.19 [#5093](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/5093)

[AdGuard for Windows 7.17
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71747050)
Release date: April 16, 2024

Greetings, intrepid ad blocking explorers! Fasten your seatbelts, because AdGuard v7.17 for Windows is about to take you into a digital dimension where we have improved Encrypted ClientHello work and implemented on-the-fly DoH connection filtering. But one thing at a time.
In the new release, we updated CoreLibs, which brings us two important features.
## Enhanced Encrypted ClientHello

AdGuard for Windows supports ECH as an experimental feature. It helps us to encrypt the very last unencrypted bit of information, thus improving your privacy level. We are working hard to resolve some technical issues so that it can become one of the default options for users. The updated CoreLibs is another step towards that goal.
## On-the-fly DoH connection filtering

CoreLibs v1.14 also allows us to implement on-the-fly DoH connection filtering. Why is it so important? Previously, if you set up DoH in a browser but not in AdGuard, we had to filter requests directly in the browser and send them to the system DNS (unencrypted). This process lowered the level of security for such users. Now the situation is completely different. With on-the-fly DoH connection filtering, we can filter DNS requests in the browser without sending them to an unencrypted server.
We also made some minor fixes here and there, updated WFP and TDI drivers, as well as DnsLibs. Check out the massive changelog below and don’t forget to update!
## Changelog

### Improvements

Added parsing for the `#` symbol [#4666](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4666)

[AdGuard for Windows 7.16
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71645420)
Release date: December 23, 2023

What number is the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything? Frankly, no clue, but AdGuard v7.16 for Windows is all about 64. We’re excited to announce that our app is now [compatible with 64-bit systems](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/2831).
## What does it mean?

Well, most Windows computers nowadays are 64-bit, they have more resources such as processing power and memory than their 32-bit predecessors. AdGuard has been loyal to the 32-bit version, but progress marches on. It’s time to embrace 64-bit compatibility, which we hope will lead to a more responsive experience for our users and make turning filters on and off feel like pure magic.
## But AdGuard still works on 32-bit computers, right?

The trusty 32-bit machines will not be forgotten. You won’t need to download a separate installer: our system will automatically detect your computer’s bitness, allowing you to install the appropriate version.
## Anything new with filtering in this version?

Of course! Another big change is that we have improved HTML filtering. We’ve added [support for selectors](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#html-filtering-rules) in HTML filtering rules, which helps block ads more effectively.
## OK, what else you’ve got?

Our latest DnsLibs brings a new feature to AdGuard for Windows: basic HTTP authentication. Why is this useful?
Those who use the DNS-over-HTTPS protocol also benefit from the features of the HTTP protocol. For instance, when using DoH, you have an authentication option that standard DNS servers simply do not have.
But what if you have a custom DNS server and you want to restrict access to it? Surely you can do it by restricting access by IP address. However, mobile devices, for example, change networks frequently. How to deal with that? This is where HTTP authentication support comes in. Using this feature in AdGuard for Windows, you can include authentication information to connect to a custom DNS server.
This feature is currently not available in AdGuard Home and AdGuard DNS, but you will be the first to know when it is!
## Surely that’s it, right?

We haven't finished yet. When it comes to HTTPS filtering, it can be difficult to сheck the original domain certificate. We’ve covered this issue in our [Knowledge base](https://adguard.com/kb/general/https-filtering/known-issues/). While AdGuard does (always!) verify validity, you might want to check it yourself.
To make HTTPS filtering more transparent for users, AdGuard now offers an option to view the original certificate in “Filtering log”. Here, you can check the details of any web request, see what kind of encryption AdGuard has used, and view the original certificate.
![Filtering log *mobile](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/blog/articles/windows_7.16/view_cert_info_en.png)
As you can see from the massive changelog, we haven’t been idle since the last release. We haven’t left the WFP and TDI drivers behind either: they’ve been freshly updated. Anyway, let’s cut the talking and go straight to updating!

## Changelog

### Fixes

[#4866](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4865)
### CoreLibs (Filtering engine)

[AdGuard for Windows 7.15
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71543850)
Release date: October 9, 2023

“To infinity and beyond” could be the motto of our hard-working AdGuard team. This time, we are pleased to introduce the fresh new version of AdGuard for Windows.
## New HTTP/3 filtering

One of the major updates in this version is the support for HTTP/3 filtering, powered by our CoreLibs v1.12. HTTP/3 (HTTP-over-QUIC) is the latest version of the HTTP protocol that uses QUIC instead of TCP. The QUIC network protocol offers many advantages over the TCP transport layer protocol, such as improved privacy and security, faster internet connection, and the ability to handle data packets in any order. Enabling HTTP/3 filtering also means more efficient ad blocking. You’re welcome!
Currently, HTTP/3 filtering only works in the Firefox browser. This is because Chrome has different logic for verifying QUIC and TCP certificates, which does not accept AdGuard certificates. However, this feature is available in Advanced settings for testing and debugging purposes to ensure seamless operation.
![HTTP/3 support *mobile border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/windows/v7.15/http3_en.png)
## Annoying bugs belong in the past

We’ve addressed a minor problem in context menus — the dark theme now appears flawless. Additionally, upon installation, you will now have five recommended ad-blocking filters readily accessible instead of just one. This upgrade will make life easier and protect you from annoying ads.
Along with other fixes, we have made several improvements to boost the overall performance of AdGuard for Windows. Previously, the application would sometimes crash due to high memory usage. However, we have addressed this issue. Also, when the internet connection was unstable or very slow, the application could behave unpredictably or even crash. Now, everything works more smoothly.
To top it all off, we have updated the WFP and TDI drivers, and as per our tradition, we have also updated CoreLibs, DnsLibs, and scriptlets to ensure even more stable operation.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.13
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71342660)
Release date: May 18, 2023

As spring arrives, AdGuard for Windows unveils its latest release, complete with numerous new features and improvements.
## Experimental Encrypted ClientHello support

Notably, the addition of experimental support for Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) is worth mentioning. This new technology fully encrypts HTTPS connections, concealing server names you are connecting to from ISPs and ensuring complete privacy.
So that you can benefit from it, we’ve added the Use Encrypted ClientHello feature to the Advanced settings section and enabled DNS protection by default for all users.
Note that the Use Encrypted ClientHello feature can only work with the low-level Block ECH setting disabled and DNS protection enabled. The thing is that ECH relies on data obtained through DNS, so in order for AdGuard to receive this data and enable ECH globally for users, DNS filtering is necessary.

For Encrypted ClientHello technology to work, it must be supported on both client and server sides. Today, ECH support is implemented in a limited number of applications. Chrome and Firefox, for example, are in the process of adding it. Here we have no choice but to wait. But thanks to AdGuard, ECH support will automatically work in all apps and browsers on your device.
To check whether ECH is working, you can:
Go to <https://crypto.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace/> and see if it says `sni=encrypted`.

![How to check if ECH is working](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/windows/v7.13/cloudflare_ech.png)
Go to <https://defo.ie/ech-check.php> and check if it says `SSL_ECH_STATUS: success`.

![How to check if ECH is on](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/windows/v7.13/defo.ie_ech.png)
As the Use Encrypted ClientHello feature is experimental, it may also lower your browsing speed a bit. But, we're currently working on solving this issue.
## New Advanced settings

We’ve also added 16 more features to the Advanced settings section. A detailed description of each feature can be found in our [Knowledge base](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-windows/solving-problems/low-level-settings/). Here we’ll only give their names.
All new advanced features can be divided into six groups:
Anti DPI options allow to modify packets at a low level during filtering to prevent tracking via deep packet inspection
Adjust size of fragmentation of initial TLS packet
Add an extra space to the plain HTTP request
Plain HTTP request fragment size

Keepalive settings allow to configure settings to work with keepalive connections
Enable TCP keepalive
TCP keepalive interval
TCP keepalive timeout

Filtering exclusion settings allow to exclude both Wi-Fi networks and particular subnets (specified in the CIDR notation) from DNS filtering
Exclude specified IP ranges from filtering
IP ranges excluded from filtering
Exclude specified Wi-Fi network names (SSID) from DNS filtering

DNS-related options allow to fine-tune DNS settings
Use fallback DNS upstreams
Use HTTP/3 for DNS-over-HTTPS
Query DNS upstreams in parallel
Always respond to failed DNS queries

Certificate security options allow to check certificates of websites and web services
Check websites' certificate transparency
Enable asynchronous OCSP SSL/TLS certificate revocation checks

Enable filtering at system start-up. Now by default, AdGuard for Windows does not filter traffic after OS startup if the option Launch AdGuard at system start-up is disabled. If you want filtering to be performed even if AdGuard is not launched, you should enable this option.

Note that before v7.12 the AdGuard's service started in filtering mode by default (even if the Launch AdGuard at system start-up was disabled). If you were satisfied with the old behavior, enable this option.
What else? Aside from the regular CoreLibs and DnsLibs updates, we’ve updated WFP and TDI drivers and ExtendedCSS. We’ve also allowed to disable the Filter localhost advanced feature. But be aware that disabling this feature will prevent AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN from working simultaneously.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.12
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71241700)
Release date: January 30, 2023

Two most important changes in this release: protection is turned on and off faster and DNS protection is now enabled by default. We’ve also fixed some bugs, updated CoreLibs and DnsLibs, and improved the WFP and TDI network drivers.
### Protection is turned on and off faster

We’ve significantly reworked everything “under the hood”, thus improving the app performance: protection is now enabled, disabled, and reloaded much faster. Previously, because of the long startup and restart of the protection, the implementation of rules and other protection features could be delayed or could even cause a web resource to “leak” past the protection. Some connections could remain unfiltered. And after all, it was very annoying for the user to watch the long startup of the app. Starting with this version, it won’t happen again.
### DNS protection is enabled by default

Now, if you have just installed AdGuard, DNS protection is automatically turned on. By default, the ISP's DNS server is used, and for security, AdGuard DNS filter is enabled: ads, trackers, and requests for malicious domains will be automatically blocked. To increase security, you can always select a DNS server from the list or add a custom one (for example, a [private AdGuard DNS server](https://adguard-dns.io)) via Settings → DNS protection.
DNS filtering allows AdGuard to catch ads and trackers even before the browser tries to connect to the ad server. So this update has also helped us improve the speed and quality of ad blocking. On top of that, DNS protection makes blocking [“hidden” trackers](https://adguard.com/blog/cname-tracking.html) more effective.
## Changelog

[AdGuard for Windows 7.10.2
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71039610)
Release date: August 2, 2022

This is a technical update aimed to increase the app stability and fix minor bugs.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.10.1
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71039600)
Release date: June 16, 2022

We are quick to learn from our mistakes. So here's our hotfix release. The manual filter update wasn't working as perfectly as we'd like it to. And we fixed it!

[AdGuard for Windows 7.10
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-71039520)
Release date: June 8, 2022

Summer is finally here — the time of new experiences, bright moments and new achievements. We’ve decided to burst into summer with a new release of AdGuard v7.10 for Windows — and that means that positive changes are waiting for you already now!One of the most important changes in this version was the addition of the “Protect from DPI” feature.
[Enhancement] Add a DPI-bypass option to AdGuard Stealth Mode [#4175](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4175)
![dpi_en.png](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/Release_notes/Windows/v7.10/dpi_en.png)
The Deep Packet Inspection is a system of deep analysis and filtering of traffic by packet content, as well as the accumulation of statistical data. Using this technology, ISPs have the ability to control the passing traffic and limit access to content for their clients.
Now AdGuard can modify outgoing packet data so that the client does not fall under the DPI blocking criteria. This means that users can get access to the content they want. However, not all DPI systems can be bypassed yet - we are still working on it.
[Enhancement] WFP and TDI network drivers
We've updated and enhanced our network drivers. This improved the app efficiency and compatibility with other software. Besides, we fixed some bugs in the WFP driver.
[Enhancement] Added dark theme to the updater window [#4156](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4156)
![updater_en.png](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/Release_notes/Windows/v7.10/updater_en.png)
A small but very nice change — we added dark theme to the updater window. Now dark theme fans won't be annoyed by light update windows — a real joy for perfectionists!
In this release we also paid attention to the DNS functionality — we improved the app reaction to changes in the system DNS addresses. Now the risk of incompatibility with other network applications that use their own DNS servers is much lower. As always, we changed, fixed and improved a lot and also updated Corelibs and DNSlibs. All the changes are listed below.
​

Release date: March 4, 2022

Some users could experience problems in AdGuard 7.9 occurring when Traffic filtering is disabled. Also, you might have faced problems with filter updates. So here we are with a hotfix that will solve them. And we also seized the opportunity to update DNSLibs and CoreLibs and make some minor bug fixes. Now the app’s performance will be more stable.
## Changelog

[Enhancement] Update CoreLibs to 1.9.43 [#4150](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4150)

[AdGuard for Windows 7.9
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-7938550)
Release date: February 21, 2022

Now we know that we can create suspense no worse than Hitchcock: since the last release, we’ve presented three versions of the app (one beta version and two release candidates). But enough is enough! Meet AdGuard 7.9 for Windows, the release we've all been waiting for. Let's list the major innovations and benefits of this version so you can savor them.
Let's start with the fact that we have worked hard on improving the performance of the application as well as its user interface. Now you'll enjoy interacting with AdGuard for Windows even more. We've also improved the advanced DNS settings by adding a bootstrap option. Don't want to use the system DNS resolver as a bootstrap? You don't have to! Now you can specify IP addresses of the DNS servers that are used to determine the address of the encrypted DNS servers.
What else? We fixed tons of bugs of different severity, including the problem with auto-activation of language filters. As a result, AdGuard's stability is improved now. Of course we couldn't avoid updating CoreLibs and DNSLibs. That's all, folks! We hope you’ll enjoy the new version of AdGuard for Windows.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.8
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-7837790)
Release date: December 16, 2021

We once again reviewed GitHub repo and realized that we had been working for almost six months on version 7.7. And less than two months on version 7.8. Yes, there were fewer tasks in this version, but we did a good job on improving everything: Browsing Security, network drivers, CoreLibs and DNSLibs, other minor features, and – hopefully – your user experience.
### [Enhancement] Browsing Security

Browsing Security is a module that blocks requests to malicious and phishing websites. You might have seen a nice looking banner caringly stating "AdGuard has blocked access to this page": that's what Browsing Security does. Now it's working a way better: requests for information about malicious domains are not sent to a server, but to a periodically updated database stored locally on your computer. This is faster and safer.
### [Enhancement] WFP and TDI network drivers

We've also updated and enhanced our network drivers for Windows – WFP and TDI. Both have been helpful, among other things, to improve compatibility with other applications.
### Other good stuff

And of course, there is no release without updating CoreLibs, our main filtering engine, and DNSLibs. Meet their new versions: more flexible, more powerful.
As always: minor bugs have been fixed.
As always: perfection has no limits.
Hope that your holidays will be safer with AdGuard.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.7.2
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-7737330)
Release date: November 10, 2021

We’ve come a long way through ~~bugs~~ thorns to the stars and finally reached the finish line (we hope so!) Many apologies for the last few versions of AdGuard for Windows: they had to be really good, but something went wrong. In one week since the last release, with your help we have found and fixed several disappointing flaws, as well as bugs in the application drivers, which turned out to be the main issue of v7.7.1. And of course we’ve updated CoreLibs — it couldn't happen any other way!

![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-7737290)
Release date: November 1, 2021

Unfortunately, the larger the update, the more the risk of letting some bugs through. The latest release of AdGuard for Windows exposed several of those so we’re ready with a hotfix. Thanks to all users who sent reports to us — it wouldn’t be possible without your help! As a result, we fixed the bugs that some of you had encountered. For instance, we fixed a network filtering bug that prevented the application from working correctly. We also solved the problem with incorrect work of the tray menu icon. In addition, we slightly redesigned the “Advanced settings” block for easier navigation.
## Changelog

[AdGuard for Windows 7.7
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-7737150)
Release date: October 13, 2021

One beta and two RCs — and here comes AdGuard v7.7 for Windows! This time we didn't encounter significant difficulties on our way to the release stage, so the development cycle turned out to be fast. Hope you'll enjoy the way the new version of AdGuard for Windows works, meanwhile we'll keep moving to the top — v8.0.
The main focus of this release was to fix bugs and improve user experience. We performed tough tests and were unable to crash the app! But you can surely fix it, right? 🙂
For starters, we implemented low-level DNS settings, added the Finnish language and updated other translations.
There are not many significant changes in this version but we’ve put our energy into something no less important. We updated CoreLibs and DNSLibs, fixed various issues along the way, and did some magic with the filtering log to make it more user-friendly.
[Enhancement] Added low-level DNS settings
There is a new section named Blocking mode for DNS in low-level settings. Now you can select the response type if you've requested a DNS domain blocked by a DNS filtering rule. There are three response types to choose from.
![advanced_settings_dns_en](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/Release_notes/Windows/v7.7/redirects_en.png)
Besides, settings with fallback servers were modified. In the previous v7.6.1 there was a simple option Enable DNS Fallback. Now users not only can enable it, but also select whether they want to use the system or custom fallback DNS. By the way, you can add several fallback servers at once.
And finally, there are DNS exclusions — domains in this list will be resolved through the system DNS.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.6.1
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-763583)
Release date: April 24, 2021

After the recent v7.6 release a small percentage of users encountered a rather severe issue of not being able to update any filters, or even the app itself. This problem isn't very common but extremely critical to those who ran into it, so it justifies an immediate hotfix.
If you're one of the unlucky ones to have this problem, AdGuard will not update automatically for you. You need to check for updates manually or reinstall the app.

[Fixed] AdGuard cannot connect to the Internet to check filters updates / license status [#3758](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/3758)
The explanation for this problem is quite technical. No reason to cite it here, you can find the detailed explanation in [this comment](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/3758#issuecomment-825632767) by AdGuard's CTO.
### Changelog

[Fixed] No filtering until "Filter localhost" is enabled after updating from v7.5 to v7.6 [#3762](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/3762)
[Other] Minor fixes & improvements

[AdGuard for Windows 7.6
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-763572)
Release date: April 21, 2021

Usually, it takes us north of 2-3 beta versions to prepare the next AdGuard for Windows release. But not this time: the first (and only) beta for v7.6 carried enough impact on its own. We added custom DNS filters, DNS-over-QUIC support for AdGuard DNS, and, of course, made the app compatible with AdGuard VPN.
[Enhancement] Custom DNS subscriptions support [#3641](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/3641)
In v7.5 we introduced DNS protection module. To refresh your memory: it offered the option to select any DNS server instead of the system default as another way to enhance your online privacy. What it didn't offer is any way to customize the DNS filtering. Once you selected the server and the preferred encryption protocol, you were set.
In this release, we give you a range of new options to shape the DNS filtering the way you want. It includes several tools, all of which can be found inside the DNS filters editor section.
![custom_dns_support_en](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/screenshots/Windows/dns_main_en.png)
DNS user rules — the most basic way to block/allow DNS requests. Works very similarly to the regular User rules. Note that it supports [DNS filtering syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-filtering-syntax), which is much less complex than the syntax for network filtering.

Importing a DNS filter — click on the 'plus' icon in the bottom left corner, and you'll see a new window pop up. Click on the Import filter button and then either enter a filter URL or browse a suitable local filter. You can find a lot of DNS filters [on this website](https://filterlists.com/). [AdGuard DNS filter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardSDNSFilter) is the only one available by default.

Adding a custom DNS filter — accesible by clicking the 'plus' icon and then choosing the Add custom filter option. Choose a name and a description and then treat the new DNS filter like any other: import rules, add or remove them manually one by one, disable and enable the filter at will in one click.

![add_new_dns_filter_en](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/screenshots/Windows/dns_new_filter_en.png)
[Enhancement] DNS-over-QUIC support
When you choose AdGuard DNS server in DNS protection, you now have an option to select [DNS-over-QUIC](https://adguard.com/en/blog/dns-over-quic.html) as your encryption protocol of choice. It's the newest protocol, with lots of advantages, and AdGuard DNS is the first public DNS provider to offer it.
[Other] Improved compatibility with AdGuard VPN
AdGuard for Windows was already compatible with [AdGuard VPN](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/welcome.html), but in this release we pushed it even further. We fixed several bugs and now the two apps will work more smoothly alongside each other.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.5 Release
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-753371)
Release date: August 20, 2020

This release incorporates all the best of two previous beta versions and two release candidates. Double-checking neve hurts, right?
There are four key changes, starring DNS filtering that will protect your DNS traffic from interception by ISPs and fraudsters. Another killer feature is an updated Stealth Mode. We’ve expanded its functionality by adding four new options that prevent Windows from collecting user data. Plus, license activation via social login and pausing protection for 30 sec. A good advanced toolkit for an ad blocker, we’d say.
### DNS filtering

This feature has been long present in other AdGuard products. Not only will the DNS module protect your DNS traffic from the ISP’s and fraudsters’ interception, it will also block ads. However, it’s important to stress that the DNS doesn’t replace normal protection, rather it works best when coupled with it.
We have a wide and regularly updated database of domain names, and now you can set it up on AdGuard for Windows.
You can choose the server type (DNS-over-HTTPS/DNS-over-TLS, etc.) that suits your needs best or add your own custom DNS server. Also, here is [a link](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/general/dns-providers/) to our Knowledge base, where we have collected the most popular DNS providers and added a quick setup option. One click, and your DNS is ready for use.
### Disable Windows 10 Tracking

Windows Tracking has four options: you can disable Windows telemetry, turn off advertising ID, disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission and disable WAP push message routing service.
To illustrate the significance of disabling system telemetry, let’s take Cortana, a virtual assistant developed by Microsoft. Its feature set is enabled by default and periodically sends usage and performance data to Microsoft. This assistant helps, but it also gathers a lot of statistics. If you, as a user, have privacy concerns (which is completely understandable and even expected in this day and age), we’ll help to disable telemetry nice and easy.
As for removing an Advertising ID, if you checkmark this option, you will stop receiving Microsoft ads (in the action center, start menu, etc.).
### Authorization and license activation via social networks

This function has already been available in our app for Android. We decided to add it here, too, because it’s truly a convenience feature.
Now, you have one more option of how to activate your license: not only via logging to your AdGuard personal account or manually entering your license key. If the email from your AdGuard personal account and the email you use for authorization in Google or Facebook are the same, you can simply authorize via these social networks. No more trying to remember email/password from your personal account and entering it! One click, and you are logged in and your license key is activated.
### Pause protection for 30 seconds

In v7.4 we introduced the new BA – more independent, glorious and autonomous. But despite it’s good in many aspects, some users asked us to return one missing thing from the old Assistant. So we did.
The old Assistant had a menu option ‘Do not filter for 30 seconds’. For instance, this function will help when you need to visit a website that won’t work when an ad blocker is enabled. In this case it makes sense to briefly disable filtering and see its content. That’s what the returned back ‘Do not filter for 30 seconds’ is also used for. But we went further and made it more convenient by adding a new function called ‘Disable protection for 30 seconds’. It will disable filtering on all websites for the same time period. You can find it in the tray menu of the main app.
Four major tasks don’t seem like a big deal. Actually, we performed many more tasks, but some of them have been omitted.

![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-743247)
Release date: June 4, 2020

Here we go - the Hotfix 2! A few more UI improvements, now it runs a lot smoother. Also, we paid special attention to the Firefox compatibility problem. Five quick stitches and AdGuard for Windows is patched up as good as new.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.4.1
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-743238)
Release date: May 28, 2020

Release rule №1 (or Murphy’s law, if you like): even when everything seems perfect, one or two hotfixes follow the new version.
This is a minor post-release fix. We’ve slightly tweaked UI trial windows, so now ‘I have a license’ option is not hidden anymore in some cases. Also, fixed the issue when a message can't be sent to support. And we also took our chance to polish a few other important things under the hood.
[Fixed] The trial window localization issue [#3333](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/3333)
[Fixed] Unable to send a message to support [#3337](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/3337)

[AdGuard for Windows 7.4
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-743232)
Release date: May 28, 2020

There's a clear headliner for the new AdGuard for Windows update: AdGuard Browser Assistant. It's a browser extension to help manage filtering right from the web page that replaces the old Assistant. We also fixed a bunch of bugs and overall enhanced the app to work faster and better.
## Browser Assistant

By developing this new product, we've resolved a couple of pretty important issues that the old Assistant had, without losing in functionality.
[Enhancement] Browser Assistant [#2985](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2985)
Meet our new AdGuard Browser Assistant! From a mere dependant userscript in AdGuard desktop apps it has evolved to become a full-fledged browser extension.
[![browser_assistant_popup_en](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/094c037b9e4eb48be041b26a1602ad28a5a6a03c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f52656c656173655f6e6f7465732f57696e646f77732f76372e342f6578745f656e2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/094c037b9e4eb48be041b26a1602ad28a5a6a03c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f52656c656173655f6e6f7465732f57696e646f77732f76372e342f6578745f656e2e706e67)
Obviously, new Assistant has the functions of the old one included but it’s far more cool and user-friendly. And it came in extremely handy, helping us solve three major problems at once:
Former AdGuard Assistant was a dependent userscript able to communicate with the app only using a certain protocol. On the contrary, new Assistant is independent: it’s installed in a browser, and you don’t need to wait while the script would be injected into the filtered web page. Putting it simply, it is more autonomous. Technically the new Assistant can be used without the app, although the app is required for the full capacity.
When AdGuard desktop app and our browser extension were used in so-called integration mode, the extension icon took over Assistant's functions. However, they could hamper each other’s work. Some websites would stop being protected by the desktop program and be backed up only by the extension which has less possibilities. With new Assistant being extension itself, there is no need to install our regular browser extension anymore, which means there is no risk of an incompatibility.
Some people didn't like seeing the old Assistant’s presence at webpages, plain an simple. New Assistant's icon resides safely next to the browser's address bar – zero chance to stand in the way of website's content.

[Enhancement] Own settings tab [#3118](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/3118)
[![browser_assistant_module_en](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5913171f6e5c84c0d58706c7be449613796f3936/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f52656c656173655f6e6f7465732f57696e646f77732f76372e342f73657474696e67735f656e2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5913171f6e5c84c0d58706c7be449613796f3936/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f52656c656173655f6e6f7465732f57696e646f77732f76372e342f73657474696e67735f656e2e706e67)
From now on, you can open this tab and get the Assistant for your default browser in one click. And in case your browser is a rare one, you can always lay on the legacy non-extension version – it works everywhere.
[Enhancement] Onboarding process [#3119](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/3119)
[![browser_assistant_onboarding_en](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/35ec64199bc2c17c5c8ddf48aaafbc172d08f07c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f52656c656173655f6e6f7465732f57696e646f77732f76372e342f6f6e626f617264696e675f656e2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/35ec64199bc2c17c5c8ddf48aaafbc172d08f07c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f52656c656173655f6e6f7465732f57696e646f77732f76372e342f6f6e626f617264696e675f656e2e706e67)
During the installation, AdGuard determines your default browser and prompts you with a download link for Assistant. If your browser is not compatible with AdGuard, the legacy version is automatically enabled.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.3 Release
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-733048)
Release date: December 25, 2019

One of the best things about Christmas is that everyone gives each other presents! So here’s our humble gift to you: AdGuard v7.3 for Windows. We hope you’ll like it, because we put a lot of effort into its development.
This version features improved ad blocking (thanks to added support for scriptlets and new modifiers), some major networking improvements and a new option to activate AdGuard via your adguard.com personal account.
[Added] Scriptlets support
Scriptlets is a powerful ad blocking instrument. You can say that scriptlet is an internal script (a mini-program) that we install with the app, and then execute that script with the help of filtering rules. Putting it simply, scriptlets allow us to modify how the code of the web page behaves. As for the practical use, this helps to fight adblocker circumvention, for example, and is also useful in some other cases.
[Added] $redirect and $rewrite modifiers support
They are practically the same modifiers, and they allow to substitute resources. If you are not a custom filtering rules aficionado, don't bother with it. Just know that it is yet another instrument in the hands of filter developers that helps to block ads more efficiently.

We should mention that both $redirect and $rewrite modifiers are still kind of working in test mode, but they are fully operational and you should feel free to use them.
[Improved] Proxy mode can now be used alongside automatic traffic filtering [#2696](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2696), [#3055](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/3055)
Previously, you had to choose between using AdGuard to filter all traffic on the current system, or setting it up as an HTTP proxy to funnel traffic of particular apps or devices through AdGuard (but without filtering it).

Now you can have the best of both worlds, and even more: filter application and browser traffic on the current PC and at the same time use AdGuard as a filtering proxy for other devices (yes, now their traffic will be filtered too). To select the configuration you want go to Network settings.
[Added] Activating AdGuard by linking personal Account [#2931](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2931)
[![activate_license_ag_account_en](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ec7c36ffcd0c3ec0c927e93e43164a68b8a61536/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f73637265656e73686f74732f57696e646f77732f6163636f756e74454e2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ec7c36ffcd0c3ec0c927e93e43164a68b8a61536/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f73637265656e73686f74732f57696e646f77732f6163636f756e74454e2e706e67)
Something we’ve tested in other AdGuard products and found positive feedback is an option to activate AdGuard by linking the app with your adguard.com account. In this case, instead of entering the license key, you put in your Account credentials (login/password). The app automatically looks for a valid license key in your Account and uses it to activate AdGuard.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.2 hotfix
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-722990)
Release date: November 27, 2019

Rarely there's a critical level bug that shows itself over 2 months since the last release, but here we are. We can't really call this update a hotfix, but it's certainly urgent. This patch fixes a bug that in some circumstances could break cosmetic filtering on all webpages.

![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-722936)

You can help us make sure such incidents won't happen again by joining our [beta testing program](https://adguard.com/beta.html). Millions of AdGuard users will thank you (and you'll even get a beta tester's license key for free)!

[AdGuard for Windows 7.2.2920
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-722920)
Release date: September 12, 2019

It’s showtime: let’s welcome AdGuard 7.2 for Windows official release.
For several months, we have been working in full swing on everything - design, performance, compatibility issues with other programs, general filtering improvement and much more. And now it’s time to tell you in detail what the new version is capable of. So let’s take a look at all changes in this update.
[Changed] Installer redesign [#2574](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2574)
When the visual style of your app’s installer doesn’t fit the visual style of the app itself, it’s not good. Same as wearing sandals with socks. So we fixed it!
[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0a0b4dad7aca5d82f592ea11d710cf94e2405435/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f73637265656e73686f74732f57696e646f77732f696e7374616c6c454e2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0a0b4dad7aca5d82f592ea11d710cf94e2405435/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f73637265656e73686f74732f57696e646f77732f696e7374616c6c454e2e706e67)
The new installer looks so good, sometimes we uninstall AdGuard just to look at it once more. Hope you like it just as much as we do! And if not, no big deal: you’re not going to come across it too often, hopefully.
[Added] Installer crash reporting tool [#2566](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2566)
One of the most annoying types of crashes, both for users and developers, is when the app crashes during the installation. Our usual crash reporting tool was useless in such cases. What’s the logical solution? Correct, to give the installer its own reporting tool!
[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/46c6942d4b9bcb92677d814131a690a0eefd178c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f73637265656e73686f74732f57696e646f77732f77696e696e7374616c6c65727265706f72742e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/46c6942d4b9bcb92677d814131a690a0eefd178c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e616467756172642e636f6d2f7075626c69632f416467756172642f73637265656e73686f74732f57696e646f77732f77696e696e7374616c6c65727265706f72742e706e67)
As you can see, it looks almost exactly the same. Nothing will be sent without your consent, and you can also add a comment with the description of the problem to help our developers fix the crash faster.
[Added] “Filter localhost" advanced setting [#2830](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2830)
Some apps, for example antiviruses, may use localhost for interactions between their components. In rare cases it could lead to compatibility problems. Now it’s possible to manage filtering of localhost with the help of the new setting.
Be sure that you know what you’re doing before messing with any of the advanced settings!

You can find this setting among advanced settings. By default, it’s disabled. We advise to try to enable it only if you experience very serious issues, e.g. when web pages don’t load or there’s no internet connection.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.1.2817
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-712817)
Release date: June 25, 2019

Usually, new stable versions are preceded with a number of betas and take longer than a month to develop. But this one is a bit different, its purpose is mainly to fix some incompatibilities (such as Windscribe VPN), so it makes a lot of sense to release this version as soon as possible. It should also spark interest in Firefox users, as we addressed several certificate-related problems unique to that browser.

[AdGuard for Windows 7.0.2693.6661
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-7026936661)
Release date: May 30, 2019

Finally, we're pretty sure we are done with eliminating bugs that were preventing us from sharing with you all the awesome new stuff that awaits you in the new version of AdGuard for Windows. So, welcome: AdGuard 7.0! From the very start you'll notice the difference, as you'll be greeted by renovated UI design. And the more you use the new version, the better you'll find it, hopefully: brand new CoreLibs filtering engine will make ad blocking better and faster. There are more goodies inside, so let's get to the gist.
## [Improved] UI and installer redesign [#2574](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2574)

It is somewhat of a tradition by this point to have a UI redesign with each major AdGuard for Windows version upgrade. This time will not be an exception. AdGuard 7.0 for Windows will look very different from the current familiar version. Yes: AG for Windows now has a dark theme too! Love it or hate it, it's there, it's optional and you are free to embrace it or ignore it altogether.
The installation wizard follows the trend and gets a redesign too. It only makes sense, because the installer is the first thing new users see when they start their acquaintance with AdGuard, and it better be good! Hope you'll find it an upgrade too.
## [Improved] Corelibs

Everybody knows what CoreLibs is by this point, but we'll remind anyway: it is a filtering engine that drives the whole process of ad blocking in most AdGuard products, AdGuard for Windows included. And with every new version of CL these products become better: the quality of ad blocking increases, they work faster and become more stable. This beta of AdGuard 7.0 for Windows features the most recent of CoreLibs version, which means this is as good as it gets. Well, at least until the next CoreLibs update :) ,In this beta we make an emphasis on UI changes but also fix several crashes. We also took this opportunity to introduce a new userscript — AdGuard Extra.,This is more of a hotfix than a beta. Some Firefox users reported problems with browser freezing. We determined that this behavior was a sequence of hanged connections, which in its turn was caused by a CoreLibs bug. It’s crucial to eliminate all such bugs before we release a stable version (which will be soon), so here we are.
## [Added] Automatic crash reports [#2298](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2298)

Sometimes apps crash, and you can do nothing about it. Reasons can be very different, and so are solutions. To be able to investigate every crash individually and find a proper fix to it, we add integration with an automatic crash report system. If AdGuard crashes, upon the next launch you'll be asked if you want to send a crash report.
Nothing will ever be sent without your consent, and if you want to know what exactly is in the report, you can check out our [Privacy Policy](https://adguard.com/en/privacy/windows.html). We'll appreciate each and every report, as it will help us greatly in making AdGuard for Windows more stable.
## [Added] AdGuard Extra extension [#2648](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2648)

In some complicated cases the usual approach with filtering rules just doesn’t work. In particular, in some cases of ad blocker circumvention/ad reinjection. So we came up with an alternative solution — a userscript. For those unfamiliar, userscripts are basically mini programs that modify web pages and augment browsing.
AdGuard Extra does it in a way that makes it harder for websites to employ the circumvention/reinjection techniques. AdGuard for Windows is the second AdGuard product to get this addition, we are thrilled to see it in action and read your feedback on it.

[AdGuard for Windows 6.4.1814.4903
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-6418144903)
Release date: October 25, 2018

This version makes a strong accent on the Networking issues. This doesn’t mean everything else was abandoned, on the contrary, there’s been a lot of ad blocking- and UI-related fixes and improvements, just the network-related fixes happened to be the most important ones.
[Fixed] Unrelated TCP connections get reset when starting AdGuard service [#2291](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAdGuardTeam%2FAdGuardForWindows%2Fissues%2F2291)
AdGuard needs to reset connections when it starts/restarts its service in order to properly filter them. What AdGuard doesn’t have to do is to reset connections that it is not going to filter anyway. So from now on, it won’t do it, as simple as that.
[Fixed] Avast Free prevents AdGuard from suppressing QUIC [#2310](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2310)
The current way of whitelisting apps from filtering for WFP driver has been extended to TDI driver. It allows to avoid compatibility issues with other software, especially with antivirus software.
[Improved] TLS version has been upgraded [#2337](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2337)
Up to this moment we were using a draft of TLS 1.3 technology ([#2155](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2155)), as we always want to be at the cutting edge. Now, as TLS 1.3 standard was officially accepted by IETF, we are happy to say that AdGuard supports the most modern encrypting standards.
[Improved] Popup Blocker has been updated to v2.5 [#2295](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2295)
Popup Blocker is an extension (userscript) that is added to AdGuard by default. As it’s clear from its name, it helps block various popup windows (most of which are all kinds of ads). It’s been around forever, but the new version for the first time features its own UI accessable from “Extensions” settings tab. You can whitelist websites there or disable notifications for certain websites. The blocking capabilities have been improved too, of course.
[Changed] TLS 1.2 is used by default if Avast is detected [#2368](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2368)
As we’ve said earlier, TLS 1.3 is the current standard, but some antiviruses still use v1.2, notably Avast. We would like to completely switch to v1.3 but have to take this into consideration.
[Fixed] Application update resets Assistant settings and restores deleted extensions [#2365](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2365)
There won’t be enough fingers combined on hands of all people in our office to count the number of times users complained about this issue. One of our current priorities is to make the process of updating AdGuard as smooth as possible, and certainly preserving users’ settings is a big step in that direction.

[AdGuard for Windows 6.3.1399.4073
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-6313994073)
Release date: July 10, 2018

While we are still polishing CoreLibs and are not ready to implement it just yet, we can sweeten the waiting with this new release. New "Nightly" update channel, added TLS1.3 support, improved performance and many more other changes.
[Added] Nightly update channel
![update_channel_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17472907/42635320-6c509b9e-85ee-11e8-9fac-ded24971c48a.PNG)
The concept of a “Nightly” build is very simple. It literally means “a build that is released at the end of every day”, hence “nightly”. In reality, it may not happen every single day, but rather every 3 or 4 days, but the idea is there. All the latest changes made by developers will be included in the nightly build (yes, including possible bugs — be prepared!). If you feel that beta is not enough for you, and you need to be a step ahead of the rest, this is the choice for you. Just go to AdGuard settings and switch to Nightly update channel.
[Added] TLS1.3 Support (draft 28) [#2155](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/#2155)
![support_tls_ru](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17472907/42648602-17bb2186-8610-11e8-91e8-70248f09e1f5.png)
TLS 1.3 is a new version of the cryptographic protocol used to encrypt messages sent via HTTP. It is faster, more secure and overall better than its predecessors. It has not been accepted by IETF as a standard yet, but it is only a matter of time. The process has already started, and we want to be at the forefront, and thus we have already added the TLS 1.3 (draft 28) support. As not everyone supports TLS1.3 yet, there can be problems on some websites potentially, so we added a new advanced setting to switch between TLS versions at will.
[Added] Option to subscribe to a filter by clicking a special link on a webpage [#1945](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/#1945)
![subscribe_by_link_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8577533/42628955-63a32cfa-85da-11e8-8eb2-4d17f26e275a.PNG)
Many filter developers put a special subscription link on their filters' homepage. Now AdGuard is able to detect these links when you click on them and will ask you if you'd like to subscribe to that filter right away. A minor thing, but it will save you just enough of extra clicks to be worthy.
[Added] A notice to inform about closed connections to websites with EV certificate [#2015](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/#2015)
![broken_ev_notify_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8577533/42627954-3a1ddd6a-85d7-11e8-984b-a9bbbfaca6b1.png)
Some websites have so-called EV (extended validation) certificates — basically, this means that the owner went through a very long and thorough process of validating their identity. In other words, these websites are generally the safest on the web. Filtering these websites is often extensive, as they rarely have ads anyway, but can sometimes lead to conflicts. AdGuard provides an option to disable filtering for such websites, and if it is enabled, a notification will inform you when you visit them for the first time. Clicking on the notification will allow to force filtering on the website anyway.
[Added] Stealth mode options applied to requests added to Filtering log [#247](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/#247)
![stealth_mode_requests_filteringLog_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8577533/42627251-267ab564-85d5-11e8-9b88-45d2ad8895b5.PNG)
This is something a lot of aspiring filtering rules creators asked for. Knowing which Stealth Mode options affected this or that request is often crucial when working on a new rule. Now you can find it right in the Filtering log when you select a request. For sure, this sounds a little bit nerdy for an average user, but we try to take into account needs of all our users, casual and advanced alike.
[Changed] Default builder has been drastically reworked [#1965](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/#1965)
Basically, this is the change that caused the build size reduction that was advertised in the introduction. As the app accretes new features over the years and the code mounts up, this becomes more and more relevant. Thanks to this change, now we can add even more!
[Improved] Better support for visually impaired users [#2068](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/#2068)
AdGuard tries to provide the best online experience for all users alike, and visually impaired users are no exception. Starting with this version, AdGuard menus are much better suited to be read by NVDA Screen Reader and other screen reading programs.
[Improved] Filters update procedure's performance [#2211](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/#2211)
If you had the misfortune of a habit to update your filters often, you certainly noticed that it took quite a lot of time, as well as installing new filters. We addressed this problem, the situation should change drastically for the better now.

[AdGuard for Windows 6.2.437.2171
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-624372171)
Release date: November 22, 2017

Over the last weeks, we've received several reports about bugs that slithered in the latest release. They turned out to be both moderately important and relatively easy to fix, so we decided to release a new update off-schedule.
[Fixed] "Reinstall certificate" feature does not work in Firefox [#2013](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/2013)
While not being the most important feature, the automatic certificate reinstall is more relevant for Firefox-based browsers than for any other ones. This fix eliminates the need to do it manually.

[AdGuard for Windows 6.2.433.2167
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-624332167)
Release date: October 25, 2017

Hello! The changelog this time is truly gigantic. Every time we thought we were going to release the current version, there was always something we felt was essential to fix, add or improve. How did it turn out?
Let's start with UI changes. Both Filtering log and Filter editor have been seriously redesigned. We need to say a big 'thank you' to everyone who has expressed his or her opinion because few changes depend as heavily on users' feedback as these.
[Changed] Filtering log rework [#96](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/96)
We know for certain that quite a few of our users are actively using Filtering log — both for creating new custom rules and generally knowing what's going on. So why not help them a bit? It has undergone a major renovation. New Filtering log overlaps with Filter editor a great bit, for example, you can create new rules and unblock blocked requests right therefrom.
There are more details to see about each request, too. The request details dialog window is very reminiscent of the Developer tools in Chrome browser. All in all, the new Filtering log is much more than a simple list of which requests are blocked and which are not.
[Changed] Filter editor rework [#1293](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1293)
Filter editor has also changed for the best. The addition of an 'Edit mode' allows replacing the data grid with a text area. This lets you copy/paste/delete many rules at once without having to bother with export/import.
Basic hotkeys are now available, which will speed up the process of working with the filter editor. There are many other quality of life changes, especially to the UI, which will draw your attention as soon as you launch the new version.
[Added] Integration with Windows 10 notifications center [#1554](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1554)
Many Windows 10 users find the Notification center to be helpful when it comes to tracking the activity of their apps. We have finally decided to take advantage of it and integrated AdGuard with the center. AdGuard has a surprisingly decent amount of various notifications. Just to name a few: notifications related to the license/trial period, automatic filter activations, new rules in User filter, Safebrowsing triggers, update checks results, etc. If you use Windows 10, you'll be able to find them all in one place now, thus making it much easier to keep up with what's going on with AdGuard.
[Changed] Network settings moved to a separate settings tab [#1404](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1404)
This one is rather straightforward. Previously, all network settings were crowding inside the 'General settings' tab making it harder to scroll up in down, searching for the one setting you need. Adding a separate first-level tab makes it easier to navigate through the app.
### Assistant and other extensions

While not being an integral part of AdGuard for Windows, some extensions (or \*userscripts\*) have grown over time to become strongly associated with it. And we showed them some love!
#### AdGuard Assistant

A lot has been done in terms of improving AdGuard Assistant, and a lot more is planned for the future, so we decided to allocate it a separate, own GitHub repository: <https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardAssistant/>
By the way, you may notice that the 'Report website' button now leads to a whole new page. Basically, what you see is a web reporting tool that allows you to easily send us a report on anything from a missed ad to a false positive. More about this later.
What else is done already? The biggest change is the ability to drag the Assistant icon across the page and place it wherever you see fit. Moreover, AdGuard will memorize the position of the Assistant icon for each website separately, so you can really customize it according to your taste and preferences.
The Assistant interface overall has become smaller but retained full functionality compared to earlier versions. There is even one new feature: a switch for toggling the filtering on the website on and off. Previously, the Assistant wasn't shown on websites with disabled filtering, and you had to go to User filter to enable it back.
Oh, and we could use your help with translating the new Assistant. Did you know that anyone can volunteer as a translator? If you feel confident, head [right here](https://adguard.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=105179) and find your native language. Don't forget to read through the [translator's memo](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-translations).
#### AdGuard PopupBlocker

[Added] AdGuard PopupBlocker extension v2.1 [#1883](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1883)
For quite a while now, AdGuard works as a userscript manager — you can install any script via AdGuard to use it in any browser. PopupBlocker has always been one of the 'native' userscripts that are installed by default, alongside AdGuard Assistant. Its purpose is clear — to block any unwanted pop-ups.
Previous version (v1.0) was functional but very little beyond that. We have completely redesigned the PopupBlocker. It now has advanced pop-up detection, compared to its predecessor and its alternatives, restores the initial click behavior and is invisible to other scripts. All in all, new PopupBlocker is a solid addition to your online protection suite.
By the way, it is available as a standalone script that can be used on its own with any other userscript manager. To find more information about PopupBlocker, visit its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/popupblocker).
#### Reports web app

[Added] Integration with Reports Web App [#1964](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1964)
When it comes to keeping our filter lists updated, we owe our users a big one. Thanks to their timely reports of missed ads, false positives etc., AdGuard filters are always up-to-date. We want to make the process of reporting a website easy for users and informative for filter developers, that’s why we decided to integrate AdGuard for Windows with a special web reporting tool.
When you see any problem like missed ad or annoyance, click on the Assistant icon and choose “Report this website”. You will be taken to a new page and asked to fill in some information about your AdGuard settings and the nature of the problem. Good thing is that AdGuard pre-fills most of the fields automatically, so most of the job is already done for you :)
We hope this change will strengthen the feedback from our users and allow AdGuard filters to stay at the cutting edge of ad blocking technology.
#### Userscripts handling

[Changed] The way AdGuard handles userscripts [#1714](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1714)
A lot of effort has been put into improving (better to say, rethinking) the way AdGuard works with userscripts. This actually has two different aspects:
First, from now on, the communication between AdGuard and Assistant is based on WebSocket, which results in better performance. This is also perfectly applicable to AdGuard Browser extension, when it is working in the integration mode with AdGuard for Windows.
Second, we have taken a whole complex of measures that allow for any external userscripts that you install via AdGuard to show higher speed and execution stability.
### Other important changes

[Added] Settings export/import [#1405](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1405)
A lot of users were asking for this, and finally we deliver. Now you can save your settings configuration into a file and then use it to set up AdGuard on another machine exactly how you prefer. Another implication of this is to quickly switch between different settings profiles without having to feverishly click through a dozen of tabs and checkboxes.
[Improved] A complete "Exit AdGuard" functionality was added [#1509](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1509)
Now users have a choice between closing AdGuard as they usually do, and closing it completely. That means closing the Windows service as well as UI, and when UI is getting started again, the service will start as well (you may be asked for the admin privileges, though).
[Added] An option to create custom filters not backed with a file [#1669](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1669)
In addition to the usual option of adding any list by URL or loading it from a local file, you can now create independent new filters from scratch. It is possible to create several such filters, give each of them their own name and fill with any rules. As a result, you can create a set of specified filters which can be separately enabled, disabled and edited.

[AdGuard for Windows 6.1.331.1732
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-613311732)
Release date: March 30, 2017

This update might not be the biggest one, in a sense it doesn't feature any revolutionary additions or the immense number of changes. But it's surely a unique one, and it's because it is by far the most influenced by the user feedback. We sincerely thank everyone who has helped us!
It is super important for two big reasons, both concern networking/compatibility: we have \*finally\* fixed the compatibility issue with KIS/ESET and, also, we've fixed a certificate issue in modern Chrome versions (59+). Details below.
[Fixed] Compatibility with KIS/ESET [#1565](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1565)
AdGuard used to have compatibility issues with such antivirus software like Kaspersky and ESET. Users had to seek for compromises: disabling SSL scanning in antivirus, disabling WFP driver or even HTTPS filtering in AdGuard. The core of the problem was the WFP network driver incompatibility, and we had had plans to develop a new driver for what now seems like an eternity.
We'd already claimed to have this fixed in the previous releases, but things turned out to be more complicated. We've come through countless iterations, test builds, and driver updates, and now we are confident enough to say that this time the problem is fixed for real. No more BSODs and other funny stuff when you run AdGuard alongside with KIS or ESET.
And again, we can't thank enough everyone who was willing to cope with raw test builds and provided invaluable feedback in order to help us make things right. Just look at the task - it is blowing up with comments. We are happy to have such users, you are awesome.
[Fixed] Compatibility with Chrome 59+
With big news which WFP driver compatibility fix is it could be easy to neglect other changes. And that would be so wrong! This fix, in particular, is of utmost importance. It ensures AdGuard will run without problems on modern (v59+) Chrome versions. Otherwise, there would be troubles with AdGuard certificate validation.
### Other

[Changed] The search criteria in the filtering log were extended [#1513](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1513)

[AdGuard for Windows 6.1.314.1628
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-613141628)
Release date: February 20, 2017

UPD: hotfix update 6.1.314 brings a fix for the bug #1569, messing with filtering when HTTPS filtering is disabled.
It was quite a while since the last AdGuard for Windows release. And there are other reasons for that apart from the Christmas/New Year holidays: we'd been extensively testing the new network driver before, finally, we felt ready to include it in the new release version. But what is there for me in this network driver, you might ask? Well, it fixes an old compatibility issue with several antivirus programs. For sure, there are other fixes and changes as well, and you will find the whole list below.

[Improved] WFP driver was updated to fix compatibility issues with KIS and ESET [#1497](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1497)
Previously, it was not unusual at all that AdGuard would have compatibility issues with some antiviruses, and KIS and ESET being the most common ones. The workarounds existed but were far from ideal - you had had to sacrifice some parts of functionality on either AdGuard or antivirus side. With updated WFP driver these conflicts will be no more, allowing users to run AdGuard alongside with KIS and ESET.
[Improved] The way we respond to HTTP protocol violation [#1452](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1452)
It would take too long to explain technical nuances, but effectively this fixes the problem some users might have come across before: when you try to open a page and it is downloaded as a file instead.

### UI

[Changed] WOT extension is now disabled by default [#1364](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1364)
Recently, an [article](https://www.ghacks.net/2016/11/01/browsing-history-sold/) was posted in one of the popular technology blogs, claiming that Web of Trust is selling its users' browser history to third-parties. WoT extension is preinstalled in AdGuard for Windows, and although it was developed by us and is not sending any of your data to WoT, we can not leave this without a reponse. For this reason we make WoT extension disabled by default in AdGuard for Windows. You can read our official stance regarding these news [in our blog](https://adguard.com/en/blog/official-statement-on-web-of-trust-case.html).
[Changed] You can now completely remove WoT extension [#1364](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1364)

[Fixed] $replace rule is shown as applied to images [#1392](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1392)
### Install/Update

[Fixed] Deleted records from HTTPs exclusions are not restored on app update anymore [#904](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/904)

Many other minor fixes and changes. The full list can be found in descriptions to prior beta versions in [our repository](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/releases) on GitHub.

[AdGuard for Windows 6.1.258.1302
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-612581302)
Release date: August 26, 2016

Briefly about new AdGuard for Windows version: Stealth Mode got new useful options, userscripts work better now, ad blocking became more advanced and our network drivers - more stable. All the details are below.
### Stealth Mode

[Added] "Self destructing cookies" option in Stealth Mode [#678](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/678)
Previously Stealth Mode module provided only the option to completely block third-party cookies. Now you will not only have an ability to differ first- and third-party cookies, but also the ability to set the exact time which cookies will be kept alive for. Important note: you can still block cookies alltogether, just set the keep-alive time to '0'.
[Added] Added an option to block "Browser location API" [#139](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/139)
[Added] Added an option to block "Browser notifications API" [#1121](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1121)
Normally browsers may detect your location and use this information to prioritize specific search results or make other various suggestions based on it. With browser location API blocked this will be impossible.
Blocking browser notifications API feature works somewhat similar, but rather prevents browser from showing things like news or social media frames that pop-up in the corner of your browser.
### Userscripts

[Improved] Content injection algorithm [#1099](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1099)
We completely redesigned content injection algorithm. First and foremost, this should solve issues with scripts that start when the page opens, resolve some of the known conflicts (AdsBypasser, YouTube+), and also optimize usage of scripts and ad blocker styles. Overall, a technical, but very important change.
[Added] Userscripts handling [#1172](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1172)
We adopted a new way of handling user.js (userscript) files. Now AdGuard will automatically detect when user.js file was processed. If it is a valid userscript, AdGuard will open a dialog window, offering user to install it. Of course, this setting will be optional and possible to turn off through settings.
### UI

[Added] Hebrew localization, Dutch localization [#1076](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1076), [#1063](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1063)
We continue to make AdGuard more easily accessible for users all over the world. This time we add two more new localizations and fix some mistakes in already existing ones.
### Networking

[Improved] Network SDK was updated [#1179](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1179)
In reality, this implies many various fixes that concern our network drivers. It would be hard to list them all here, and most of them are rather technical anyway. For example, the WFP driver - Windows Defender compatibility issue was addressed.
### Ad Blocking

[Added] Support for extended selectors [#1225](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1225)
This is a technical term, but what hides behind it? With extended selectors support, we can much more easily create some rules that were very, very hard to create earlier. Notably, this concerns rules required to block such things as 'Sponsored posts' on Facebook.
[Added] Extended CSS support
This is a very important addition in terms of future (and present) possibilities that it opens for ad blocking. Extended CSS is a module for applying CSS styles with extended selection properties. Basically, it means that we will be able to select and, therefore, block some elements that we would not be able to block otherwise. Currently we support following pseudo-classes: [-ext-has (:has)](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardBrowserExtension/issues/321), [-ext-contains (:contains)](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardBrowserExtension/issues/322), [[-ext-matches-css (:matches-css)](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/ExtendedCss/issues/7).
### Other

Dozens of minor fixes and improvements.

A hotfix after last weeks release. Previously there turned out to be several problems, including router page loading problem and other. These bugs are fixed with this version.
[Fixed] Indefinite loading of router page [#1042](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1042)

[AdGuard for Windows 6.0.224.1092
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-602241092)
Release date: April 14, 2016

Good news, everyone! We haven't seen any new bugs since the latest beta version, and it means nothing else but the new stable release is arriving. During the last couple of months that had passed since the 6.0 release we were able to track quite a lot of bugs and defects, which were crucial to fix. So we concentrated on them for a while. Finally, everything seems to be fixed and we are ready to turn on the autoupdate for all our users who still use Adgguard 5.10. We were looking forward to this moment! Even if you were already using AdGuard 6 and you are not as excited by these news, you should be. This release means we can finally put all our efforts into implementing cool new features you might have or have not seen in our [roadmap](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-roadmap.html). In case you missed last beta releases and respective release notes, you can catch up and read about all the fixes and additions below. Most important of them, as usual, are described in detail.
UI changes
[Changed] AdGuard uses native-style tray menu now [#1006](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1006)
[Changed] AdGuard window is now opened with a single click on tray menu [#1030](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1030)
[Fixed] 'About' window content is not flickering anymore [#954](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/954)
[Fixed] Empty strings are now removed when importing user filter [#973](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/973)
[Fixed] Error previously encountered while installing a userstyle [#934](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/934)
[Improved] Proxy name validator now recognizes domain names and not only IP addresses [#931](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/931)

Ad Blocker
[Improved] Added $stealth modifier that disables Stealth Mode for the specified website [#339](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/339) As we already mentioned in our blog, separate whitelist for Stealth Mode is on our roadmap. It is a much needed feature for anyone who actively uses Stealth Mode. We are not quite there yet, but we made a big step in the right direction by implementing $stealth modifier. It works similar to all other modifiers, just add it to any exception rule and it will disable Stealth Mode for that website specifically, even if the module itself is enabled. For example: @@||example.org^$stealth You can find more information about rules formatting on our website: [adguard.com/filterrules.html](https://adguard.com/filterrules.html)
[Changed] Facebook windows app added to default filtered apps list [#974](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/974)
[Changed] $replace rules should now have higher priority than other basic rules [#1023](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1023)

[Fixed] Language-specific filters are now detected properly from users keyboard layouts [#401](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/401)
[Improved] AdGuard now can process websites names in punycode when adding them to HTTPS exclusions [#962](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/962)

Languages and Translations
[Added] Support for complex language codes [#808](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/808) We have completely reworked applications localization system. This allowed us to significantly increase number of languages we can potentially support (this mostly concerns various dialects, alternative alphabets etc.).
[Added] Croatian language

Networking
[Improved] HTML content detection [#855](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/855) Content type detection was significantly improved. This effectively means that AdGuard will not interfere with those types of traffic which do not require filtering, decreasing the number of potential conflicts.
[Fixed] Web interface of TP-Link router is broken [#844](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/844) Some of our users encountered problems with accessing TP-Link routers' interface with enabled AdGuard. Upon investigating this issue we discovered a serious issue with WFP driver which resulted in problems with displaying some websites. As a result, we have improved communication with some specific web-servers.
[Added] Support for HTTP method REPORT [#1020](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1020)
[Fixed] AdGuard can now detect HTML if there is an xml declaration at the document start [#1011](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1011)

[Fixed] Issue with unexpected connection reset with TDI driver [#1025](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/1025)

[Fixed] CMD window is no more shown on AdGuard update [#935](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/AdGuardForWindows/issues/935)

[AdGuard for Windows 6.0.204.1025
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-602041025)
Release date: March 2, 2016

[Fixed] Issues in Windows 10 Insider Preview build caused by SHA-1 certificate used for network drivers.
Let us elaborate a little on this one, since this change stands out as the most important one in this update. Recently we have noticed, with the help of our beta testers, that SHA-1 certificate previously used to sign our network drivers, was in a process of being deprecated. Effectively this means that users of Windows 10 Insider Preview were not able to enable AdGuard protection. We have signed our network drivers with new certificates, and now all users will be able to run AdGuard without any problems.
UI Changes
[Fixed] 'Upgrade license' notification is no more shown for licenses activated with beta key
[Fixed] Bug when some apps wouldn't show among 'filtered apps' until they are started
[Fixed] Latest update check time is not being updated
[Fixed] Pressing Alt-F4 while in AdGuard tray menu will no longer result in closing the main window

Ad Blocker
[Fixed] K-Meleon browser is now correctly detected as installed
[Fixed] Unnecessary language-specific filter activation
[Fixed] WebRTC will no more be blocked for applications which are not in the Filtered Apps list
[Improved] Default HTTPs exclusions list was significantly updated

Install/Update
[Changed] Auto update mechanism
[Fixed] AdGuard beta won't update after clicking on 'Install' button in 'About' section
[Fixed] MSI shows "remove settings" dialog on uninstall.
[Fixed] WFP driver is now uninstalled correctly on Win 10 x64

Languages and translations
[Fixed] "User filter" is not translated to Polish

Networking
[Fixed] AG code is no more injected into

[AdGuard for Windows 6.0.188.974
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-60188974)
Release date: February 4, 2016

It is finally time to release AdGuard 6! We have put a lot of time and effort into its development, and you will see this reflected in the release notes. A lot was added, even more was improved compared to AdGuard 5. New version became much more intuitive in use, functional and diverse.
AdGuard user interface was completely redesigned. It will now have modern tile design. Compared to AdGuard 5, it is much better structurized and more visually attractive.
AdGuard was translated into many new languages. That includes UI, AdGuard Assistant and filter descriptions etc.
Window positions are now memorized and restored after program restart.
Tray menu is reworked, improved accessibility of different options through tray.
New versions interface is much more friendly to people with visual impairment. For example, now Windows screen reader sees almost all the elements of the program – tips, tuning, and more.
UI performance and boot speed were significantly optimized, memory consumption was greatly reduced. You can find respective graphs in blog (see the link below).
Now with the first launch of AdGuard a tutorial will be shown, familiarizing user with AdGuard and quickly introducing its capabilities.

Stealth Mode serves to protect your online privacy in various ways, including blocking of third-party cookies, hiding IP address and many, many more.
Improved support for filtered apps. AdGuard now automatically finds software installed on your computer and offers to filter its traffic, this includes modern UI applications. Of course, you still can add any browser (or any app) manually. The mechanism for adding new applications to AdGuard itself is completely redesigned too, and now it is easy for any user to cope with it.
Filter editor and Filtering log were drastically changed. You will find both fresh design and improved functionality. In the Filter editor, you can see the rules created by the AdGuard Assistant, that is, all the rules that you added manually. Filtering Log displays all the requests sent.
You can now use new search feature to search the whole program for any keyword by entering it in the text field in the top right corner. We believe this is one of the most useful innovations. Now you do not have to go through the entire section of the program in search for the information you need.
Now it is possible to subscribe to any filter by URL or by choosing path to a local file, and AdGuard will automatically watch for changes.
Extensions were allocated to a separate module which can be enabled/disabled as a whole.
Userscripts security was significantly improved.
Plentiful additions and improvements to filtering process were made, notably introducing support for new rules modifiers and improving filtering speed.
Many more improvements, all of which are impossible to include in these release notes.

[AdGuard for Windows 5.10.1164.5985
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-51011645985)
Release date: September 10, 2014

Short list of important changes: greatly reduced memory usage, we introduced convenient addition of new ad filters, integration with WoT is now a separate extension, added support for new browsers, fixed conflicts with popular programs and defects in the processing of requests and more.
##### Memory usage reduction

We have significantly optimized memory usage in 5.10. Now, even if you use an old computer or a weak netbook, AdGuard will work silently in a background without slowing down your device. We compared memory footprint with the one of the preceding version. And we must say 5.10 showed a result several times lower.
##### More ad filters

In addition, AdGuard has became an even more comprehensive program. Now users can install any ad filters. What does it mean? In addition to the filters that are already installed in AdGuard by default, you can add third-party ones, such as a list of filters that allow AdGuard to block ads in different segments of the Internet - websites in different languages, in particular. All of this can be done directly in the program, simply by selecting a filter you want and clicking on the "Add selected" button.
##### Displaying the possible danger

Integration with [Web of Trust](https://www.mywot.com) is now brought out in the separate extension, which can be disabled. Also a warning when visiting a suspicious website has changed. With the help of WoT, our AdGuard is able to notify you instantly about the reputation of websites and show the reasons for which the site is considered to be suspicious. "Categories of suspicion" can be, in particular: scam, potentially illegal, misleading claims or unethical, poor customer experience, privacy risks and others.
##### Other changes in version 5.10:

Added support for CSS injection rules. It gives us more flexible options for high-quality elements blocking.
Ability to edit the source code of userscripts. Now you can customize any script you like, you can find more about what it is and how to install it [here](https://adguard.com/en/userscripts.html).
Updates are checked only for the enabled userscripts.Thus we update only those scripts that you actually use. Why spend the extra traffic?
Extensions that do not use external resources are returned to the "default." Now you have the opportunity to reset the extensions and return websites to their original state.
Added a configuration of exceptions for secure (HTTPS) sites filtering. Adding https websites to exceptions in order for AdGuard to not filter it, used to be impossible.
Increased time of filter updates up to 12 hours. Yeah, longer but of better quality.
Speeded up the work of extensions (including Youtube Center). Userscripts do not slow down websites now.
##### Fixed in new version:

Fixed conflicts with Visual Studio, Tor Browser, Keepass.
Fixed slow loading of large js files.
Assistant no longer interferes in work of RequireJs websites.
Updated network drivers, fixed some small remarks.
Fixed a defect with the processing of HTTP DELETE requests.
Fixed work of Twitch Chat Filter userscript.
Fixed a bug when using proxy authorization.
Fixed compatibility error of vk.com and Parental Control.
Fixed a defect with disabling AdGuard assistant via the context menu.
Fixed some minor defects of AdGuard assistant.
Speeded up filtering of some pages (fixed problem with octane-benchmark.googlecode.com).
Fixed API for usercripts (thanks to YoutubeCenter developer, Jeppe Rune Mortensen).
Fixed rules with the "~third-party" modifier.
New versions of TDI and WFP drivers. Fixed some compatibility issues.
Minor changes to the texts in the user interface.

[AdGuard for Windows 5.9.1081.5529
![](https://cdn.adguard.info/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg)](#version-5910815529)
Release date: March 13, 2014

Version 5.9 brings a large number of changes to AdGuard.
## New features

### AdGuard Extensions

In version 5.9, there is an opportunity to install extensions (userscripts). They are designed to extend the functionality of websites. How exactly will the functionality be extended depends on the particular userscript. This can be a pop-up blocking, blocking of flash requests, possibility to download music and video from social networks and much more.
You can learn more from [this post](https://adguard.com/en/blog/) in our blog.
### Improved video ads blocking

In this version, AdGuard learned to recognize most of the video ads on its own without relying on filter databases.
### Parental Control

During the existence of the program, we have received many requests from our users about implementing the "Parental Control" in it. Many parents found AdGuard helpful, because when using it the child didn’t see inappropriate advertising.
Finally, in the version 5.9 we are ready to introduce “Parental Control” - a separate module of the program.

You can learn more from [this article](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-parental-control.html).
