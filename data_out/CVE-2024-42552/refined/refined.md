The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Hotel-Management-System.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `book_id` parameter within the `/admin_room_history.php` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: The vulnerability can lead to an escalation of privileges.
- Data Breach: An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, booking information, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `/admin_room_history.php`.
- `book_id` Parameter: The SQL injection occurs through the `book_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter: The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter (`book_id`).
- Basic SQL Injection Knowledge: The attacker requires a working understanding of SQL syntax to craft a malicious query.
