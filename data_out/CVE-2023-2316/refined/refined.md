Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper path handling within the `typora://` custom URL scheme in Typora. This scheme, intended for loading local resources, does not properly restrict access to the local file system when accessed from within an embedded webpage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The `typora://app/` URL scheme allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the local file system, bypassing intended access restrictions.
*   **Local File Disclosure:** The ability to specify arbitrary paths allows an attacker to read the contents of local files that the user has access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality breach:** Attackers can read sensitive local files, such as configuration files, user documents, or credentials, potentially leading to further compromise of the user's system or accounts.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The content of the disclosed files can be sent to an attacker-controlled server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Markdown Files:** An attacker can embed a malicious `<embed>` tag within a markdown file. When a user opens this file in Typora, the embedded page can access local files.
*   **Copy and Paste:** An attacker can create a malicious webpage that, upon copying text, injects the malicious embed tag into the clipboard. When the user pastes this content into Typora, the embedded page can access local files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to either open a malicious markdown file or copy text from a malicious website and paste it into Typora.
*   The attacker needs a way to host the malicious HTML payload which can be done through their own server or compromised website.
*   No special privileges are needed on the victim's machine to perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Typora versions prior to 1.6.7 on both Windows and Linux.
*   The vulnerability leverages the `<embed>` tag to load a webpage capable of exploiting the `typora://app/` URL scheme.
*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates reading `C:\Windows\win.ini` on Windows and `/etc/passwd` on Linux.
