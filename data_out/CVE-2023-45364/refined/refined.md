Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect permission checks when displaying the "Missing-revision-permission" message for deleted revisions in MediaWiki. Specifically, `RevisionArchiveRecord::userCan()` was not checking if a user had the necessary permissions to view revisions of deleted pages, only checking for revision-deletion permissions. This resulted in users without the required permissions seeing the message "deleted but you can view it" along with a link, instead of the correct "missing-revision" message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Permission Checks:** The core issue was a lack of proper permission verification for viewing archived revisions of deleted pages. `RevisionArchiveRecord` inherited permission checks from `RevisionRecord` which did not account for page deletion status, resulting in the disclosure of the existence of deleted content and timestamps.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although users could not access the deleted content, the incorrect message revealed information (revision ID, timestamp) about deleted revisions that they shouldn't have been able to see, which is considered a low-severity information disclosure issue.
*   **Incorrect Message Display:** The system displayed a message implying the user had permission to view the deleted revision when they did not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Low-Severity Information Disclosure:** The primary impact was the disclosure of metadata (revision ID and timestamp) related to deleted content. Although not directly granting access to content, this was considered an information leak.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Link Access:** The vulnerability could be triggered by a user accessing a direct link to a deleted revision (e.g., `...&oldid=203915712`).
*   **No Special Permissions Required:** The vulnerability affected regular users (including anonymous IPs) without special permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Deleted Revision ID:** An attacker needed to know (or guess) the `oldid` of a deleted revision of a page they don't have the permission to see.
*   **No Special Access:** No administrative or elevated privileges were required to trigger this issue.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fix involves adding a check for the 'deletedtext' and 'deletedhistory' permissions to make sure users are not provided the link to view a deleted revision if they lack those permissions.
* There was a discussion about whether to change `RevisionArchiveRecord::userCan()` to check for page deletion permissions, or just fix the specific area of code affected by the bug. This discussion led to the filing of T345777, and the decision was to implement a fix to the specific area of code affected by the bug, but leave the underlying behavior of `RevisionArchiveRecord::userCan()` for later discussion.
* The issue was considered low risk and was publicly disclosed and backported to stable versions of MediaWiki.
