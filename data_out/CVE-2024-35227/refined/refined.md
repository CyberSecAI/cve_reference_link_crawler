The provided content is related to CVE-2024-35227.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `Object#send` in the `Onebox::Engine::StandardEmbed` class within the Discourse application. The `send` method allows calling any method on an object, including private or protected ones, which can be exploited when processing untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted method invocation: The use of `Object#send` allows an attacker to potentially call arbitrary methods on the `normalizer` object, which can lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service.
- Code injection: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the use of `send` can be a risk factor for code injection if the method names are derived from attacker-controlled input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: By crafting a malicious URL that triggers the `Onebox` functionality, an attacker can cause a denial of service by overloading the server or causing it to perform an excessive number of operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be performed remotely by sending a malicious URL to a Discourse instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No privileges required: The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction: The attack does not require any user interaction. The attacker only needs to send a crafted URL to the Discourse instance.
