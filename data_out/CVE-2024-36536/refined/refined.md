{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure permissions in fabedge v0.8.1 and earlier versions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect Access Control. The vulnerability allows attackers to obtain the service account's token.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can access sensitive data, escalate privileges, compromise all Secrets components in k8s, further compromise other components in the cluster, and potentially take over the entire Kubernetes cluster.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "1. The attacker steals the token by taking control of a worker node and forcing fabedge's pod to run on that node.",
    "2. Use the obtained token to authenticate with the API server.",
    "3. Use the privileges to access all Secrets in the cluster.",
    "4. Use the sensitive information in the Secrets to elevate privileges and explore other sensitive resources, eventually taking over the entire cluster."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to gain control of a worker node. This can be done by exploiting other vulnerabilities within the cluster. The attacker also needs knowledge of the fabedge deployment, and Kubernetes RBAC."
