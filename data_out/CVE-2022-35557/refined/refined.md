Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/goform/wifiSSIDget` endpoint of the Tenda W6 router firmware.
- Specifically, a stack buffer overflow occurs within the `formwrlSSIDget()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `index` parameter in the `/goform/wifiSSIDget` endpoint is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow. The code doesn't properly validate the size of the input, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted request with an overly long `index` parameter, an attacker can overwrite the stack, leading to a crash of the device and causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/goform/wifiSSIDget`.
- **Form Data:** The `index` parameter is included in the form data of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Tenda W6 router's web interface (e.g. being on the same network, or able to access the device remotely if exposed).
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the existence and location of the vulnerable `/goform/wifiSSIDget` endpoint.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to create POST requests with a large value for the `index` parameter.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code shows how to construct a request with a large `index` value (specifically 0x1000 'a' characters) that triggers the overflow.
- The affected firmware version is Tenda W6 V1.0.0.9(4122).
- A demonstration video is provided as well.
