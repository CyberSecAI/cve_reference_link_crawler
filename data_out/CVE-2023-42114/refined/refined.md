- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of NTLM challenge requests in Exim. This lack of validation can lead to a read past the end of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information in the context of the service account.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted NTLM challenge requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely without authentication.
