- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A relative path traversal vulnerability exists in the FortiADC CLI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of relative paths in CLI commands allows for path traversal (CWE-23).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A privileged attacker can delete arbitrary directories from the underlying file system via crafted CLI commands. This can lead to a denial of service or other system instability.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability through the FortiADC CLI by crafting specific commands with relative paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires privileged access to the FortiADC CLI to exploit this vulnerability.
