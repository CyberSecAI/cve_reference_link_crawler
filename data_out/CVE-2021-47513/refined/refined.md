Based on the provided content, this CVE relates to a memory leak in the `felix_setup_mmio_filtering` function within the Linux kernel's DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) driver for the Ocelot family of switches, specifically the Felix variant.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability occurs because the code was missing a check for when no CPU port is defined in the `felix_setup_mmio_filtering` function. If no CPU port is found (indicated by `cpu < 0`), dynamically allocated memory for `tagging_rule` and `redirect_rule` is not freed before the function returns.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak. When the function exits due to a lack of a CPU port, the allocated memory for `tagging_rule` and `redirect_rule` isn't freed using `kfree`, resulting in a memory leak with each call to `felix_setup_mmio_filtering` when a CPU port is not defined.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated calls to `felix_setup_mmio_filtering` under the specific conditions (no CPU port defined) could lead to memory exhaustion over time. If the driver is repeatedly initialized without a CPU port being defined, this would accumulate memory loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves causing the driver to initialize without a CPU port being defined. This could happen unintentionally due to configuration issues or through malicious attempts to trigger the memory leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to configure the DSA driver or system such that no CPU port is defined, and then cause the `felix_setup_mmio_filtering` function to be called multiple times. This likely requires privileged access to the system.

The provided patches address the issue by adding a check for `cpu < 0` and freeing the allocated memory using `kfree(tagging_rule)` and `kfree(redirect_rule)` before returning with `-EINVAL` in that scenario. This fix prevents the memory leak.
