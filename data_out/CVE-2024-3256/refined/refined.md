```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input for the `activity_id` parameter in the `admin/edit_activity.php` file before using it in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability is present due to lack of input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": "The `activity_id` parameter in the URL of `admin/edit_activity.php` is the attack vector.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable URL and manipulate the `activity_id` parameter. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication, assuming the attacker can reach the vulnerable endpoint. Knowledge of SQL is required to craft the injection payloads."
