Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The User Feedback plugin for WordPress (versions <= 1.0.7) does not properly sanitize user-submitted feedback before storing it in the database. Specifically, the `save_survey_response` function in `class-userfeedback-frontend.php` does not filter the submitted text from users/visitors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the feedback form. This code is then stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the feedback responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of an administrator's browser session. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect the admin to malicious websites, modify the website content, and potentially take control of the WordPress site.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can steal session cookies, potentially leading to unauthorized access to admin accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the feedback form provided by the plugin on the front-end of the website.
- A user (including unauthenticated visitors) can submit malicious JavaScript code within the feedback form's text input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges, and can be an unauthenticated visitor.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the feedback form on the website's front-end.
- They must be able to craft and submit a malicious payload.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in the `save_survey_response` function in `wp-content/plugins/userfeedback-lite/includes/db/class-userfeedback-frontend.php`. Specifically, the function fails to sanitize the `answers` parameter obtained via `get_json_params()`.
- The vulnerable code is:
```php
public function save_survey_response(WP_REST_Request $request)
{
	...
    $response_id = UserFeedback_Response::create(
        array_merge(
            $request->get_json_params(),
            array(
                'survey_id'    => sanitize_text_field($survey_id),
				...
            )
        )
    );
	...
}
```
- The `create()` function within `wp-content/plugins/userfeedback-lite/includes/db/class-userfeedback-db.php` doesn't sanitize the input data.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0.8 of the plugin by using `sanitize_text_field()` to filter user input before saving it to the database.
- A sample payload is `<img src=x onerror=”alert(document.cookie)” />` which when submitted and viewed by an admin triggers a javascript alert containing the admin's cookies.
