- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly validate user identity claims in the `userregister.php` file, leading to an improper authentication vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication (CWE-287). The system does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by manipulating inputs to the `userregister.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable `userregister.php` file on the remote server.
