[`de6f90e`](/ultimatemember/ultimatemember/commit/de6f90e9fa1ca9439d5ad688a8ba9d127849aa05)

### Enhancements:

* Added: Custom fields callbacks blacklist. Use `um_dropdown_options_source_blacklist` filter for adding your custom functions to the custom callbacks blacklist. By default, there are all PHP internal functions.

### Bugfixes:

* Fixed: Posts' restriction that is based on term restriction settings
* Fixed: Issue with class name in checkbox and radio. Class name being 'activeright' instead of 'active right'
* Fixed: Admin upgrade scripts and upgrades pack validation
* Fixed: Directory traversal vulnerabilities
* Fixed: Destroying user sessions after changing "Approved" status to something else (e.g. deactivated)
* Fixed: Conflict when `wp_get_current_user()` not exists. Transferred restriction settings callbacks to the `plugins_loaded` hook
* Fixed: Restriction post displaying when 404 is enabled and old restriction logic isn't active
* Fixed: PHP warning when nav menu is empty
* Fixed: Disable auto-login after the user is registered by the Administrator and UM Registration form
* Fixed: Some typos errors
* Fixed: Using apostrophe symbols in emails for registration and login both
* Fixed: Sanitizing YouTube links. Applying both <https://youtu.be/xxxxxxx> and <https://youtube.com/xxxxxxx> links

### Deprecated:

* Removed: Outdated setting using in code (force\_display\_name\_capitlized). Moved the functionality to extended [repo](https://github.com/ultimatemember/Extended/tree/main/um-capitalize-name#readme)
