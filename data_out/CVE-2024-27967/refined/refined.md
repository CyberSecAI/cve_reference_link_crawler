- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "DSGVO All in one for WP" versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress site under their current authentication context. The specific impact varies based on the actions the plugin exposes.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into triggering the request. The user must have an active session with the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated but requires the user to be logged into the WordPress site.
