The provided content relates to CVE-2024-34529.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the direct printing of the Keycloak administrator username and password in the console output during Nebari deployment. This exposes sensitive credentials to anyone with access to the console output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the Keycloak root password through console output. This is a direct violation of secure coding practices, as passwords should never be directly printed or logged.
- **CWE-532:** The issue is explicitly identified with CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log File. Although in this case it is console output rather than a log file, the root cause is the same.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the console output during the Nebari deployment process can obtain the Keycloak administrator credentials. This allows the attacker to gain full administrative control over the Keycloak instance.
- This control can be used to compromise the entire system, as Keycloak is often used for authentication and authorization within Nebari.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the console output during the deployment process is required. This could occur if an attacker has unauthorized access to the deployment environment, such as a CI/CD pipeline, a user's terminal, or logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to observe the console output during the Nebari deployment process.
- The attacker needs no special privileges on the target system, beyond the ability to see the output.
- The attacker could be an insider with access to deployment systems, or an outsider with access to logs, or an unintended user of a shared console during the deployment process.
