    "Root cause": "Improper input sanitization within the 'Cover Letter' functionality of Oracle Content Manager.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],

This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the victim user, and potentially compromise the system if the victim has higher privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed via HTTP protocol.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted 'Cover Letter' using the vulnerable functionality of Oracle Content Manager. The attacker could also be a malicious user with access to the system through the web interface."
