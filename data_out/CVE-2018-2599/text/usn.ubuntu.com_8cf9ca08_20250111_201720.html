# USN-3613-1: OpenJDK 8 vulnerabilities

2 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 8.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [openjdk-8](/security/cves?package=openjdk-8) - Open Source Java implementation

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the cryptography

implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could possibly use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-2579](/security/CVE-2018-2579))

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly

validate uses of the invokeinterface JVM instruction. An attacker could

possibly use this to access unauthorized resources. ([CVE-2018-2582](/security/CVE-2018-2582))

It was discovered that the LDAP implementation in OpenJDK did not properly

encode login names. A remote attacker could possibly use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-2588](/security/CVE-2018-2588))

It was discovered that the DNS client implementation in OpenJDK did not

properly randomize source ports. A remote attacker could use this to spoof

responses to DNS queries made by Java applications. ([CVE-2018-2599](/security/CVE-2018-2599))

It was discovered that the Internationalization component of OpenJDK did

not restrict search paths when loading resource bundle classes. A local

attacker could use this to trick a user into running malicious code.

([CVE-2018-2602](/security/CVE-2018-2602))

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly restrict memory allocations

when parsing DER input. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause

a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-2603](/security/CVE-2018-2603))

It was discovered that the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) implementation

in OpenJDK in some situations did not guarantee sufficient strength of keys

during key agreement. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-2618](/security/CVE-2018-2618))

It was discovered that the Java GSS implementation in OpenJDK in some

situations did not properly handle GSS contexts in the native GSS library.

An attacker could possibly use this to access unauthorized resources.

([CVE-2018-2629](/security/CVE-2018-2629))

It was discovered that the LDAP implementation in OpenJDK did not properly

handle LDAP referrals in some situations. An attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information or gain unauthorized privileges.

([CVE-2018-2633](/security/CVE-2018-2633))

It was discovered that the Java GSS implementation in OpenJDK in some

situations did not properly apply subject credentials. An attacker could

possibly use this to expose sensitive information or gain access to

unauthorized resources. ([CVE-2018-2634](/security/CVE-2018-2634))

It was discovered that the Java Management Extensions (JMX) component of

OpenJDK did not properly apply deserialization filters in some situations.

An attacker could use this to bypass deserialization restrictions.

([CVE-2018-2637](/security/CVE-2018-2637))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the AWT

component of OpenJDK when loading the GTK library. An attacker could

possibly use this to execute arbitrary code and escape Java sandbox

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-2641](/security/CVE-2018-2641))

It was discovered that in some situations OpenJDK did not properly validate

objects when performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (application crash or excessive memory

consumption). ([CVE-2018-2663](/security/CVE-2018-2663))

It was discovered that the AWT component of OpenJDK did not properly

restrict the amount of memory allocated when deserializing some objects. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory

consumption). ([CVE-2018-2677](/security/CVE-2018-2677))

It was discovered that the JNDI component of OpenJDK did not properly

restrict the amount of memory allocated when deserializing objects in some

situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(excessive memory consumption). ([CVE-2018-2678](/security/CVE-2018-2678))
