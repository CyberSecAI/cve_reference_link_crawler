Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-28456

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Online Marriage Registration System. User-supplied data from the marriage registration form text fields are not being validated or sanitized before being stored and displayed to the administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the registration form fields is stored in the database and executed in the administrator's browser when they view the registration request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful XSS exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the administrator's browser session.
*   **Account Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal admin session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content or behavior of the web page viewed by the administrator.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the administrator to malicious websites or initiate downloads of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Marriage Registration Form:** The primary attack vector is the marriage registration form. Text fields in this form are vulnerable to XSS payload injection.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected XSS payload is stored in the database, leading to persistent exploitation whenever the administrator views the stored data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Access:** The attacker must be able to access and submit the marriage registration form.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft XSS payloads.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable System:** Campcodes Online Marriage Registration System v1.0
*   **Payload:** A standard `<script>alert(1)</script>` payload is sufficient to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Exploitation:** The attacker submits the XSS payload through the registration form. When the admin views the registration request, the payload executes.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information indicates that the XSS payload is executed when the administrator attempts to view the marriage registration request.
*   The vulnerability was tested on Windows and Kali Linux, suggesting it's a platform-agnostic web application issue.

**Summary:** The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the Campcodes Online Marriage Registration System. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker via the marriage registration form by injecting malicious JavaScript code into form fields which will be executed when an administrator views the submission.
