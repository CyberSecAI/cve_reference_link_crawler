- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IPMI simulator (ipmi_sim) in OpenIPMI lacks a check on the authorization type of incoming LAN messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing input validation on the authorization type field within incoming IPMI LAN messages leads to a potential out-of-bounds access issue when processing the message.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by causing the `ipmi_sim` process to crash. The vulnerability does not appear to allow for code execution or unauthorized authentication with high probability.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted IPMI LAN messages with a specific authorization type can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send LAN messages to the `ipmi_sim` service. The attacker needs to have knowledge of the system using ipmi_sim for this attack to be feasible.
