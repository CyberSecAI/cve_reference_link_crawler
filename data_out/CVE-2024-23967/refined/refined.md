The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23967.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of base64-encoded data within WebSocket messages. Specifically, the Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charger fails to validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow
- Lack of input validation on the length of base64 decoded data
- Insufficient validation of user-supplied data

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the affected device with the privileges of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-adjacent attack
- Exploitation through specially crafted WebSocket messages
- Bypassing authentication mechanism (though authentication is required, this bypass is possible)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network-adjacent access to the Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charger.
- Ability to craft and send malicious WebSocket messages.
- The ability to bypass the existing authentication mechanism.
