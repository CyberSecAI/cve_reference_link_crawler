Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-33328:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of user-provided input within a system command without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `file_name` parameter passed to the `/ajax/remove/` endpoint is used to construct a shell command using `sfmt` and `system` which allows for OS command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application directly incorporates user-supplied data into a system command, enabling an attacker to inject malicious commands.
- Insecure use of `sfmt` and `system` functions without proper input validation/sanitization.
- The `strstr` check on the `file_name` parameter only prevents the use of `..` to traverse directories, but not injection of other shell metacharacters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the device with the privileges of the web server. This could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Packets:** The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/ajax/remove/` endpoint.
- The `file_name` parameter is where the malicious command is injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device hosting the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker likely needs to be authenticated to access the `/ajax/remove/` endpoint, as indicated by the CVSS score having "PR:H" (Privileges Required: High).
- The attacker needs knowledge of the API to craft the malicious request.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code section is within the `/ajax/remove/` endpoint handler:
    ```c
    undefined4 /ajax/remove/(Webs *webs)
    {
        [...]
        file_name = (char *)websGetVar(webs,"file_name",0);                                               [11]
        if ((file_name != (char *)0x0) &&
            (shell_command = strstr(file_name,".."), shell_command == (char *)0x0)) {
            shell_command = (char *)sfmt("rm %s -rf",file_name);                                            [12]
            iVar1 = system(shell_command);                                                                  [13]
            [...]
        }
    }
    ```
- At `[11]`, the `file_name` parameter from the HTTP request is retrieved.
- The code at `[12]` then constructs a shell command using `sfmt` and inserts `file_name` directly into the `rm` command.
- Finally, at `[13]`, the constructed shell command is executed by using `system`.
- A check is performed to prevent directory traversal using "..", however other shell metacharacters are not blocked.

**Additional Notes:**
- The report provides a detailed code walkthrough that allows for easy understanding of the vulnerability.
- This report is part of a group of similar vulnerabilities in different API endpoints of the same device.
