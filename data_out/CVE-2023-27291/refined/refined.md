{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "IBM Watson CP4D Data Stores does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could obtain sensitive information by gaining access to the unencrypted data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector is not defined, but an attacker could exploit the lack of encryption through various methods.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the storage or transmission medium containing the sensitive information."
