- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Input Validation in the SSL VPN portal of FortiOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of input within the SSL VPN portal, specifically when processing POST requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the SSL VPN service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a remote, unauthenticated attacker sending a crafted POST request to the SSL VPN portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable SSL-VPN portal and have knowledge of how to craft the malicious POST request, but does not need any authentication or privileged access.
