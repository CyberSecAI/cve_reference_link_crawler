| Describe the bug I am currently using Tauri to build a plugin platform. These plugins, developed using Vue, React, etc., plugin's run within `<iframe>` elements in the main window. loaded through `HTTP` or `custom protocol`, for example, `http://localhost:5174/index.html` or `custom_protocol://localhost/index.html` Currently, there are significant security concerns because when these plugins install `@tauri-apps/api`, they can freely invoke Tauri's API functions, for example, `appWindow.hide()` And they can even use `window.__TAURI_POST_MESSAGE__` to call my Rust API.  Is there a way to prevent `<iframe>` from accessing `Tauri's API` and `window.__TAURI_POST_MESSAGE__`? or can we intercept the requestÔºü  I understand that this may not be considered a bug, but addressing this security concern is crucial for my project.  If providing code snippets would be helpful, please let me knowüôè.

| Will [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) meet your needs?  No, web worker can't solve my problem. What I want is that iframe js code cannot use `Tauri API`. |

| I've got a similar request for the ability to load an iframe which will use HTML in the same style as the isolation pattern. I'm not sure how to load this without opening a window though. Can I refer to the bundled html with a particular scheme? |
