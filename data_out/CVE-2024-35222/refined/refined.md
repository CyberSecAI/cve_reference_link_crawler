{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Tauri IPC initialization script was unintentionally injected into iframes on MacOS, which allowed iframes to access Tauri IPC endpoints.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The origin check for Tauri API access control was bypassed, allowing iframes to access IPC endpoints exposed to the parent window.",
      "The Tauri IPC initialization script was being injected into iframes on MacOS"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote origin iframes in Tauri applications could access the Tauri IPC endpoints without explicit allowance, potentially allowing malicious iframes to execute commands the application is authorized to perform.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to have script execution capabilities (e.g., via XSS) within a script-enabled iframe of a Tauri application.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to inject malicious code into an iframe of the Tauri application. This is commonly achieved through vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)."
