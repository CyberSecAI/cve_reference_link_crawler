Hikvision Wi-Fi IP Cameras associate to a default unencrypted rogue SSIDs in a wired configuration
Full disclosure
Nov 27, 2017

Synopsis:
---
HikVision Wi-Fi IP cameras come with a default SSID "davinci", with a setting of no WiFi encryption or authentication.
Depending on the firmware version, there is no configuration option within the camera to turn off Wi-Fi. If a camera is
deployed via wired ethernet, then the WiFi settings won’t be adjusted, and a rogue AP with the SSID "davinci" can be
associated to the camera to provide a new attack vector via WiFi to a wired network camera.

Risk:
---
The security exposure provides an unexpected attack surface via Wi-Fi in a camera deployed in a wired environment.
Devices running a firmware prior to v5.4.5 can be attacked via an access control bypass.
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Sep/23>
The camera will also do a DHCP on its wireless interface, so the rogue AP subnet would get preference versus a L3
adjacent NVR/viewer, performing a denial of service.

Mitigation:
---
The mitigation since the Wi-Fi cannot be turned off, is to specify a complex WPA2-PSK AES key.  With this the camera
will try to associate to a wireless PSK that doesn’t exist, and it is unlikely that the attacker will be able to guess
the complex key.
Via the web interface:
Configuration -> Network -> Advanced Settings -> Wi-Fi
Set Security Mode to: “WPA2-personal”
Set Encryption Type to: “AES”
Set Key 1 to: A random long string of characters
Enable WPS: Uncheck

Vulnerability details:
---
Tested Model Number (Confirmed): DS-2CD2432F-IW
Tested Firmware Versions (Confirmed): 5.3.0, 5.4.0, 5.4.5
Exploit:  Camera is hardwired via ethernet.  Wi-Fi is unconfigured (by default).
Set up a rogue Wi-Fi access point with an SSID of "davinci" with no encryption.
The camera will associate with the rogue access point.  There is no configuration option for the administrator to turn
off WiFi. If the rogue access point offers DHCP the camera will get a dynamic address and be remotely accessible within
Wi-Fi range. Combined with previous firmware exploits an attacker could remotely exploit or disable the camera simply
by being within Wi-Fi range.  The attack also circumvents any wired network security that may have been deployed on
that segment, such as Firewalls, ACLs, turning off UPnP.
