  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of an unprotected `eval` function in the `create_a_list` function of the `mindsdb/integrations/handlers/sharepoint_handler/sharepoint_api.py` file. This allows for arbitrary code execution when creating a list in the SharePoint integration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code (‘Eval Injection’)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the machine running the MindsDB instance, leading to complete compromise of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious value for the `column` parameter when creating a SharePoint list using the MindsDB SharePoint integration."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated to a MindsDB instance that has the SharePoint integration installed.",
        "affected_products": "MindsDB versions v23.10.5.0 up to v24.7.4.1."
