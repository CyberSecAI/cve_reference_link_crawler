| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the shader\_record\_register\_usage function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor. |
