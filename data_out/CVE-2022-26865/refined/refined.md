- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Dell SupportAssist OS Recovery versions prior to 5.5.2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the OS Recovery authentication and run arbitrary code on the system with Administrator privileges. This allows for complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have physical access to the targeted Dell system. They do not need to be authenticated.
