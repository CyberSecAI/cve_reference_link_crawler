- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the "Translations" settings are vulnerable to XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's "Translations" settings. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into these settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as admin access, to modify the plugin settings. This can be exploited even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed, for example, in a multisite setup.
