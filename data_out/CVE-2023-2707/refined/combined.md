## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Appointment booking addon for Gravity Forms <= 1.9.5.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

The "Translations" settings of the plugin are vulnerable to XSS using the payload: `"/><img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>`
Entering it for any value and reloading the page will result in the XSS.

### Affects Plugins
