# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1683

## WellinTech KingHistorian User authentication information disclosure vulnerability

##### March 20, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-45124

##### SUMMARY

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to leverage this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05

##### PRODUCT URLS

KingHistorian - <https://www.wellintech.com/product/kinghistorian>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-200 - Information Exposure

##### DETAILS

KingHistorian is a time-series database used for ingesting and analyzing industrial control system data. KingHistorian is designed to be high performance and highly reliable for process data.

The protocol used to communicate with XDBServer uses a mixture of ciphering and compression, which prevents plaintext strings from being sent directly. However, if an attacker captured an authentication packet, all the necessary information is included in the packet to recover the username and password.

Packets contain a 0x14-byte header starting with ‘SORB’ in ASCII as magic bytes. The rest of this header is uninteresting for this attack. Once the 0x14 bytes are skipped over, the packet’s first byte of data contains a flag to display if it is compressed, with the least-significant bit of the first byte representing the compression flag. If the packet is compressed, it is decompressed with `quicklz` . Once decompressed, the data can be recovered using length and value encoding to recover a structure as follows:

```
pub struct BrkConnectionOption {
    username: String,
    ciphered_password: String,
    application_name: String,
    client_name: String,
    callback_proxy: String,
    collector_name: String,
    network_timeout: i32,
    connection_flags: i32,
    reserved_1: i32,
    reserved_2: i32,
    session_id: String,
    reserved_4: String,
    enc_key_1: i32,
    enc_key_2: i32,
    enc_key_3: i32,
    enc_key_4: i32,
    os_version: String,
    protocol_version: i32,
    system_general_1: i32,
    system_general_2: i32,
    system_general_3: i32,
    system_general_4: i32,
}

```

By combining the parts of the `enc_key`, it is possible to decipher the `ciphered_password` from the packet back into the plaintext form.
