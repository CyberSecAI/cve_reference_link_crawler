```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The protocol used to communicate with XDBServer uses a mixture of ciphering and compression, which prevents plaintext strings from being sent directly. However, all the necessary information is included in the authentication packet to recover the username and password.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Information exposure due to the ability to decipher the password from captured network packets.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can recover plaintext usernames and passwords by sniffing network traffic containing authentication packets.

Attack vectors:
Network sniffing of authentication packets.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be in a position to sniff network traffic.
