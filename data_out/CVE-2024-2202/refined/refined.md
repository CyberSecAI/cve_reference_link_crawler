{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the legacy Image widget of the Page Builder by SiteOrigin plugin.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the legacy Image widget's settings, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or above."
