Certain software builds for various Android devices contain a vulnerable pre-installed app with a package name of com.factory.mmigroup (versionCode='3', versionName='2.1) that allows local third-party apps to perform various actions, due to inadequate access control, in its context (system user), but the functionalities exposed depend on the specific device. The following capabilities are exposed to zero-permission, third-party apps on the following devices: arbitrary AT command execution via AT command injection (T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, and Boost Mobile Celero 5G); programmatic factory reset (Samsung Galaxy A03S, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, Realme C25Y, and Lenovo Tab M8 HD), leaking IMEI (Samsung Galaxy A03S, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, and Realme C25Y); leaking serial number (Samsung Galaxy A03s, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, Realme C25Y, and Lenovo Tab M8 HD); powering off the device (Realme C25Y, Samsung Galaxy A03S, and T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G); and programmatically enabling/disabling airplane mode (Samsung Galaxy A03S, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, and Realme C25Y); and enabling Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS (Samsung Galaxy A03S, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, and Realme C25Y). No permissions or special privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerabilities in the com.factory.mmigroup app. No user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows: Boost Mobile Celero 5G (Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW\_S98119AA1\_V067:user/release-keys, Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW\_S98119AA1\_V064:user/release-keys, Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW\_S98119AA1\_V061:user/release-keys, and Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW\_S98119AA1\_V052:user/release-keys); Samsung Galaxy A03S (samsung/a03sutfn/a03su:13/TP1A.220624.014/S134DLUDU6CWB6:user/release-keys and samsung/a03sutfn/a03su:12/SP1A.210812.016/S134DLUDS5BWA1:user/release-keys); Lenovo Tab M8 HD (Lenovo/LenovoTB-8505F/8505F:10/QP1A.190711.020/S300637\_220706\_BMP:user/release-keys and Lenovo/LenovoTB-8505F/8505F:10/QP1A.190711.020/S300448\_220114\_BMP:user/release-keys); T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G (T-Mobile/Augusta/Augusta:12/SP1A.210812.016/SW\_S98121AA1\_V070:user/release-keys and T-Mobile/Augusta/Augusta:12/SP1A.210812.016/SW\_S98121AA1\_V066:user/release-keys); T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G (T-Mobile/Sprout/Sprout:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW\_S98115AA1\_V077:user/release-keys and T-Mobile/Sprout/Sprout:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW\_S98115AA1\_V060:user/release-keys); and Realme C25Y (realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1675861640000:user/release-keys, realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1664031768000:user/release-keys, realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1652814687000:user/release-keys, and realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1635785712000:user/release-keys). This malicious app sends a broadcast Intent to com.factory.mmigroup/.MMIGroupReceiver. This causes the com.factory.mmigroup app to dynamically register for various action strings. The malicious app can then send these strings, allowing it to perform various behaviors that the com.factory.mmigroup app exposes. The actual behaviors exposed by the com.factory.mmigroup app depend on device model and chipset. The com.factory.mmigroup app executes as the "system" user, allowing it to interact with the baseband processor and perform various other sensitive actions. | N/A - AWAITING ANALYSIS |

On the TCL 10L device, the vulnerable app has a package name of com.tcl.sos (versionCode='2020102827', versionName='v3.2014.12.1012.B'). When a third-party app declares and requests the missing permission, it can interact with certain service components in the aforementioned apps (that execute with "system" privileges) to perform arbitrary files reads/writes in its context. An app exploiting this vulnerability only needs to declare and request the single missing permission and no user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows: TCL 10L (TCL/T770B/T1\_LITE:11/RKQ1.210107.001/8BIC:user/release-keys) and TCL 30Z (TCL/4188R/Jetta\_ATT:12/SP1A.210812.016/LV8E:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta\_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU5P:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta\_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU61:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta\_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU66:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta\_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU68:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta\_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU6P:user/release-keys, and TCL/T602DL/Jetta\_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU6X:user/release-keys). This malicious app declares the missing permission named com.tct.smart.switchphone.permission.SWITCH\_DATA as a normal permission, requests the missing permission, and uses it to interact with the com.tct.smart.switchdata.DataService service component that is declared in vulnerable apps that execute with "system" privileges to perform arbitrary file reads/writes. | N/A - AWAITING ANALYSIS |

| [CVE-2021-41848](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41848) | An issue was discovered in Luna Simo PPR1.180610.011/202001031830. It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi\_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled. | 7.8 |

| [CVE-2018-15006](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15006) | The ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.android.zte.hiddenmenu (versionCode=23, versionName=6.0.1) that contains an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.android.zte.hiddenmenu.CommandReceiver that is accessible to any app co-located on the device. This app component, when it receives a broadcast intent with a certain action string, will write a non-standard (i.e., not defined in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code) command to the /cache/recovery/command file to be executed in recovery mode. Once the device boots into recovery mode, it will crash, boot into recovery mode, and crash again. This crash loop will keep repeating, which makes the device unusable. There is no way to boot into an alternate mode once the crash loop starts. | 5.5 |
| [CVE-2018-15005](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15005) | The ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.zte.zdm.sdm (versionCode=31, versionName=V5.0.3) that contains an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.zte.zdm.VdmcBroadcastReceiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate a factory reset. In addition, the app initiating the factory reset does not require any permissions. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of a pre-installed platform app. | 7.1 |

The com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.2) that contains an exported service named com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode.MbnTestService that allows any app co-located on the device to provide key-value pairs to set certain system properties. Notably, system properties with the persist.\* prefix can be set which will survive a reboot. On the Vivo V7 device, when the persist.sys.input.log property is set to have a value of yes, the user's screen touches be written to the logcat log by the InputDispatcher for all apps. The system-wide logcat log can be obtained from external storage via a different known vulnerability on the device. The READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission is necessary to access the log files containing the user's touch coordinates. With some effort, the user's touch coordinates can be mapped to key presses on a keyboard. | 4.7 |
| [CVE-2018-15001](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15001) | The Vivo V7 Android device with a build fingerprint of vivo/1718/1718:7.1.2/N2G47H/compil11021857:user/release-keys contains a platform app with a package name of com.vivo.bsptest (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0) containing an exported activity app component named com.vivo.bsptest.BSPTestActivity that allows any app co-located on the device to initiate the writing of the logcat log, bluetooth log, and kernel log to external storage. When logging is enabled, there is a notification in the status bar, so it is not completely transparent to the user. The user can cancel the logging, but it can be re-enabled since the app with a package name of com.vivo.bsptest cannot be disabled. The writing of these logs can be initiated by an app co-located on the device, although the READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission is necessary to for an app to access the log files. | 5.5 |
| [CVE-2018-15000](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15000) | The Vivo V7 Android device with a build fingerprint of vivo/1718/1718:7.1.2/N2G47H/compil11021857:user/release-keys contains a platform app with a package name of com.vivo.smartshot (versionCode=1, versionName=3.0.0). This app contains an exported service named com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService that will record the screen for 60 minutes and write the mp4 file to a location of the user's choosing. Normally, a recording notification will be visible to the user, but we discovered an approach to make it mostly transparent to the user by quickly removing a notification and floating icon. The user can see a floating icon and notification appear and disappear quickly due to quickly stopping and restarting the service with different parameters that do not interfere with the ongoing screen recording. The screen recording lasts for 60 minutes and can be written directly to the attacking app's private directory. | 6.3 |
| [CVE-2018-14999](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14999) | The Leagoo P1 device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c\_1h10\_32v4\_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.wtk.factory (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0) that contains an exported broadcast receiver named com.wtk.factory.MMITestReceiver allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate a factory reset.

This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of a pre-installed platform app. | 9.1 |
| [CVE-2018-14998](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14998) | The Leagoo P1 Android device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c\_1h10\_32v4\_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys contains a hidden root privilege escalation capability to achieve command execution as the root user. They have made modifications that allow a user with physical access to the device to obtain a root shell via ADB by modifying read-only system properties at runtime. Specifically, modifying the ro.debuggable and the ro.secure system properties to a certain value and then restarting the ADB daemon allows for a root shell to be obtained via ADB. | 6.8 |
| [CVE-2018-14997](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14997) | The Leagoo P1 Android device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c\_1h10\_32v4\_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys contains the android framework (i.e., system\_server) with a package name of android that has been modified by Leagoo or another entity in the supply chain. The system\_server process in the core Android package has an exported broadcast receiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate the taking of a screenshot and have the resulting screenshot be written to external storage. The taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user; the device has a screen animation as the screenshot is taken and there is a notification indicating that a screenshot occurred. If the attacking app also requests the EXPAND\_STATUS\_BAR permission, it can wake the device up using certain techniques and expand the status bar to take a screenshot of the user's notifications even if the device has an active screen lock. The notifications may contain sensitive data such as text messages used in two-factor authentication. The system\_server process that provides this capability cannot be disabled, as it is part of the Android framework. The notification can be removed by a local Denial of Service (DoS) attack to reboot the device. | 5.5 |
| [CVE-2018-14996](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14996) | The Oppo F5 Android device with a build fingerprint of OPPO/CPH1723/CPH1723:7.1.1/N6F26Q/1513597833:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.dropboxchmod (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0) that contains an exported service named com.dropboxchmod.DropboxChmodService that allows any app co-located on the device to supply arbitrary commands to be executed as the system user. This app cannot be disabled by the user and the attack can be performed by a zero-permission app. Executing commands as system user can allow a third-party app to video record the user's screen, factory reset the device, obtain the user's notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and obtains the user's text messages, and more. This vulnerability can also be used to secretly record audio of the user without their awareness on the Oppo F5 device. The pre-installed com.oppo.engineermode app (versionCode=25, versionName=V1.01) has an exported activity that can be started to initiate a recording and quickly dismissed. The activity can be started in a way that the user will not be able to see the app in the recent apps list. The resulting audio amr file can be copied from a location on internal storage using the arbitrary command execution as system user vulnerability. Executing commands as system user can allow a third-party app to factory reset the device, obtain the user's notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), change the default Input Method Editor (IME) (e.g., keyboard) with one contained within the attacking app that contains keylogging functionality, obtain the user's text messages, and more. | 7.8 |
| [CVE-2018-14995](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14995) | The ZTE Blade Vantage Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z839/sweet:7.1.1/NMF26V/20180120.095344:user/release-keys, the ZTE Blade Spark Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z971/peony:7.1.1/NMF26V/20171129.143111:user/release-keys, the ZTE ZMAX Pro Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/P895T20/urd:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170418.114928:user/release-keys, and the ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contain a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.android.modem.service (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.1; versionCode=23, versionName=6.0.1) that exports an interface to any app on co-located on the device. Using the exported interface of the com.android.modem.service app, any app can enable and obtain certain log files (modem and logcat) without the appropriate corresponding access permissions. The modem logs contain the phone number and full text body of incoming and outgoing text messages in binary format. In addition, the modem log contains the phone numbers for both incoming and outgoing phone calls. The system-wide logcat logs (those obtained via the logcat binary) tend to contain sensitive user data. Third-party apps are prevented from directly reading the system-wide logcat logs. The capability to read from the system-wide logcat logs is only available to pre-installed system apps and platform apps. The modem log and/or logcat log, once activated, get written to external storage (SD card). An app aware of this vulnerability can enable the logs, parse them for relevant data, and exfiltrate them from the device. The modem log and logcat log are inactive by default, but a third-party app with no permissions can activate them, although the app will need to be granted the READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission to access them. | 4.7 |

| [CVE-2018-14984](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14984) | The Leagoo Z5C Android device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c\_1h10\_32v4\_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed app with a package name of com.android.messaging (versionCode=1000110, versionName=1.0.001, (android.20170630.092853-0)) with an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.android.messaging.trackersender.TrackerSender. Any app co-located on the device, even one with no permissions, can send a broadcast intent with certain embedded data to the exported broadcast receiver application component that will result in the programmatic sending of a text message where the phone number and body of the text message is controlled by the attacker. | 7.5 |
| [CVE-2018-14983](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14983) | The Sony Xperia L1 Android device with a build fingerprint of Sony/G3313/G3313:7.0/43.0.A.6.49/2867558199:user/release-keys contains the android framework (i.e., system\_server) with a package name of android (versionCode=24, versionName=7.0) that has been modified by Sony or another entity in the supply chain. The system\_server process in the core android package has an exported broadcast receiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate the taking of a screenshot and have the resulting screenshot be written to external storage. The taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user; the device has a screen animation as the screenshot is taken and there is a notification indicating that a screenshot occurred. If the attacking app also requests the EXPAND\_STATUS\_BAR permission, it can wake the device up using certain techniques and expand the status bar to take a screenshot of the user's notifications even if the device has an active screen lock. The notifications may contain sensitive data such as text messages used in two-factor authentication. The system\_server process that provides this capability cannot be disabled, as it is part of the Android framework. The notification can be removed by a local Denial of Service (DoS) attack to reboot the device. | 5.5 |
| [CVE-2018-14982](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14982) | Certain LG devices based on Android 6.0 through 8.1 have incorrect access control in the GNSS application. The LG ID is LVE-SMP-180004. | 9.8 |

| [CVE-2018-14980](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14980) | The ASUS ZenFone 3 Max Android device with a build fingerprint of asus/US\_Phone/ASUS\_X008\_1:7.0/NRD90M/US\_Phone-14.14.1711.92-20171208:user/release-keys contains the android framework (i.e., system\_server) with a package name of android (versionCode=24, versionName=7.0) that has been modified by ASUS or another entity in the supply chain. The system\_server process in the core android package has an exported broadcast receiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate the taking of a screenshot and have the resulting screenshot be written to external storage (i.e., sdcard). The taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user; the device has a screen animation as the screenshot is taken and there is a notification indicating that a screenshot occurred. If the attacking app also requests the EXPAND\_STATUS\_BAR permission, it can wake the device up using certain techniques and expand the status bar to take a screenshot of the user's notifications even if the device has an active screen lock. The notifications may contain sensitive data such as text messages used in two-factor authentication. The system\_server process that provides this capability cannot be disabled, as it is part of the Android framework. The notification can be removed by a local Denial of Service (DoS) attack to reboot the device. | 7.1 |
| [CVE-2018-14979](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14979) | The ASUS ZenFone 3 Max Android device with a build fingerprint of asus/US\_Phone/ASUS\_X008\_1:7.0/NRD90M/US\_Phone-14.14.1711.92-20171208:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed app with a package name of com.asus.loguploader (versionCode=1570000275, versionName=7.0.0.55\_170515). This app contains an exported service app component named com.asus.loguploader.LogUploaderService that, when accessed with a particular action string, will write a bugreport (kernel log, logcat log, and the state of system services including the text of active notifications), Wi-Fi Passwords, and other system data to external storage (sdcard). Any app with the READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission on this device can read this data from the sdcard after it has been dumped there by the com.asus.loguploader. Third-party apps are not allowed to directly create a bugreport or access the user's stored wireless network credentials. | 4.7 |
| [CVE-2018-6599](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6599) | An issue was discovered on Orbic Wonder Orbic/RC555L/RC555L:7.1.2/N2G47H/329100b:user/release-keys devices, allowing attackers to obtain sensitive information (such as text-message content) by reading a copy of the Android log on the SD card. The system-wide Android logs are not directly available to third-party apps since they tend to contain sensitive data. Third-party apps can read from the log but only the log messages that the app itself has written. Certain apps can leak data to the Android log due to not sanitizing log messages, which is in an insecure programming practice. Pre-installed system apps and apps that are signed with the framework key can read from the system-wide Android log. We found a pre-installed app on the Orbic Wonder that when started via an Intent will write the Android log to the SD card, also known as external storage, via com.ckt.mmitest.MmiMainActivity. Any app that requests the READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission can read from the SD card. Therefore, a local app on the device can quickly start a specific component in the pre-installed system app to have the Android log written to the SD card. Therefore, any app co-located on the device with the READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission can obtain the data contained within the Android log and continually monitor it and mine the log for relevant data. In addition, the default messaging app (com.android.mms) writes the body of sent and received text messages to the Android log, as well as the recipient phone number for sent text messages and the sending phone number for received text messages. In addition, any call data contains phone numbers for sent and received calls. | 5.5 |
| [CVE-2018-6598](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6598) | An issue was discovered on Orbic Wonder Orbic/RC555L/RC555L:7.1.2/N2G47H/329100b:user/release-keys devices. Any app co-located on the device can send an intent to factory reset the device programmatically because of com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver. This does not require any user interaction and does not require any permission to perform. A factory reset will remove all user data from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that the user has not backed up or synced externally. This capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves), although this capability is present in an unprotected component of the Android OS. This vulnerability is not present in Google's Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code. Therefore, it was introduced by Orbic or another entity in the supply chain. | 7.1 |
| [CVE-2018-6597](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6597) | The Alcatel A30 device with a build fingerprint of TCL/5046G/MICKEY6US:7.0/NRD90M/J63:user/release-keys contains a hidden privilege escalation capability to achieve command execution as the root user. They have made modifications that allow a user with physical access to the device to obtain a root shell via ADB. Modifying the read-only properties by an app as the system user creates a UNIX domain socket named factory\_test that will execute commands as the root user by processes that have privilege to access it (as per the SELinux rules that the vendor controls). | 6.8 |
| [CVE-2017-18671](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18671) | An issue was discovered on Samsung mobile devices with L(5.0/5.1), M(6.0), and N(7.x) software. Intents related to Wi-Fi have incorrect exception handling, leading to a crash of system processes. The Samsung ID is SVE-2017-8389 (May 2017). | 7.5 |
| [CVE-2017-18663](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18663) | An issue was discovered on Samsung mobile devices with N(7.x) software. Because of missing Intent exception handling, system\_server can have a NullPointerException with a crash of a system process. The Samsung IDs are SVE-2017-9122, SVE-2017-9123, SVE-2017-9124, and SVE-2017-9126 (July 2017). | 7.5 |
| [CVE-2017-13108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-13108) | DFNDR Security Antivirus, Anti-hacking & Cleaner, 5.0.9, 2017-11-01, Android application uses a hard-coded key for encryption. Data stored using this key can be decrypted by anyone able to access this key. | 7.5 |

| [CVE-2017-7978](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7978) | Samsung Android devices with L(5.0/5.1), M(6.0), and N(7.x) software allow attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading a world-readable log file after an unexpected reboot. The Samsung ID is SVE-2017-8290. | 7.5 |
| [CVE-2017-5217](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5217) | Installing a zero-permission Android application on certain Samsung Android devices with KK(4.4), L(5.0/5.1), and M(6.0) software can continually crash the system\_server process in the Android OS. The zero-permission app will create an active install session for a separate app that it has embedded within it. The active install session of the embedded app is performed using the android.content.pm.PackageInstaller class and its nested classes in the Android API. The active install session will write the embedded APK file to the /data/app directory, but the app will not be installed since third-party applications cannot programmatically install apps. Samsung has modified AOSP in order to accelerate the parsing of APKs by introducing the com.android.server.pm.PackagePrefetcher class and its nested classes. These classes will parse the APKs present in the /data/app directory and other directories, even if the app is not actually installed. The embedded APK that was written to the /data/app directory via the active install session has a very large but valid AndroidManifest.xml file. Specifically, the AndroidManifest.xml file contains a very large string value for the name of a permission-tree that it declares. When system\_server tries to parse the APK file of the embedded app from the active install session, it will crash due to an uncaught error (i.e., java.lang.OutOfMemoryError) or an uncaught exception (i.e., std::bad\_alloc) because of memory constraints. The Samsung Android device will encounter a soft reboot due to a system\_server crash, and this action will keep repeating since parsing the APKs in the /data/app directory as performed by the system\_server process is part of the normal boot process. The Samsung ID is SVE-2016-6917. | 5.5 |
| [CVE-2016-10139](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10139) | An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The two package names involved in the exfiltration are com.adups.fota and com.adups.fota.sysoper. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. Therefore, the app executing as the system user has been granted a number of powerful permissions even though they are not present in the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file. This app provides the com.adups.fota app access to the user's call log, text messages, and various device identifiers through the com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider component. The com.adups.fota app uses timestamps when it runs and is eligible to exfiltrate the user's PII every 72 hours. If 72 hours have passed since the value of the timestamp, then the exfiltration will be triggered by the user plugging in the device to charge or when they leave or enter a wireless network. The exfiltration occurs in the background without any user interaction. | 7.8 |
| [CVE-2016-10138](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10138) | An issue was discovered on BLU Advance 5.0 and BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device can interact with. Therefore, any app can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by the WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system user. The third-party app, utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver, can perform the following actions: call a phone number, factory reset the device, take pictures of the screen, record the screen in a video, install applications, inject events, obtain the Android log, and others. In addition, the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will make a request to a URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do where the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by the server will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is made via HTTP, it is vulnerable to a MITM attack. | 7.8 |
| [CVE-2016-10137](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10137) | An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete the user's sent and received text messages and call log. This allows a third-party app to obtain PII from the user without permission to do so. | 7.8 |
| [CVE-2016-10136](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10136) | An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete files owned by the system user. The third-party app can modify the /data/system/users/0/settings\_secure.xml file to add an app as a notification listener to be able to receive the text of notifications as they are received on the device. This also allows the /data/system/users/0/accounts.db to be read which contains authentication tokens for various accounts on the device. The third-party app can obtain privileged information and also modify files to obtain more privileges on the device. | 7.8 |
| [CVE-2016-10135](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10135) | An issue was discovered on LG devices using the MTK chipset with L(5.0/5.1), M(6.0/6.0.1), and N(7.0) software, and RCA Voyager Tablet, BLU Advance 5.0, and BLU R1 HD devices. The MTKLogger app with a package name of com.mediatek.mtklogger has application components that are accessible to any application that resides on the device. Namely, the com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.LogReceiver and com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.MTKLoggerService application components are exported since they contain an intent filter, are not protected by a custom permission, and do not explicitly set the android:exported attribute to false. Therefore, these components are exported by default and are thus accessible to any third party application by using android.content.Intent object for communication. These application components can be used to start and stop the logs using Intent objects with embedded data. The available logs are the GPS log, modem log, network log, and mobile log. The base directory that contains the directories for the 4 types of logs is /sdcard/mtklog which makes them accessible to apps that require the READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission. The GPS log contains the GPS coordinates of the user as well as a timestamp for the coordinates. The modem log contains AT commands and their parameters which allow the user's outgoing and incoming calls and text messages to be obtained. The network log is a tcpdump network capture. The mobile log contains the Android log, which is not available to third-party apps as of Android 4.1. The LG ID is LVE-SMP-160019. | 5.5 |
| [CVE-2016-6910](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6910) | The non-existent notification listener vulnerability was introduced in the initial Android 5.0.2 builds for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge devices, but the vulnerability can persist on the device even after the device has been upgraded to an Android 5.1.1 or 6.0.1 build. The vulnerable system app gives a non-existent app the ability to read the notifications from the device, which a third-party app can utilize if it uses a package name of com.samsung.android.app.portalservicewidget. This vulnerability allows an unprivileged third-party app to obtain the text of the user's notifications, which tend to contain personal data. | 5.5 |
| [CVE-2015-9547](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9547) | An issue was discovered on Samsung mobile devices with JBP(4.3) and KK(4.4.2) software. Because the READ\_LOGS permission is mishandled, sensitive information is disclosed in a world-readable copy of the log file if the error message is "Unhandled exception in Dalvik VM," "Application not responding ANR event," or "Crash on an application's native code." The Samsung ID is SVE-2015-2885 (October 2015). | 7.5 |
