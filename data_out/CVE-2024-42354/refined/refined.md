{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The store-API was not properly considering ManyToMany associations when processing criteria, leading to potential exposure of non-ApiAware fields.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Access Control (CWE-284)"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to sensitive data through the store-API by exposing fields that are not marked as ApiAware in the EntityDefinition.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network access to the store-API endpoint.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to craft specific requests to the store-API to exploit this vulnerability. No specific privileges are required, but the attacker requires some user interaction.",
    "details": "The store-API uses regular entities and only exposes fields marked as `ApiAware` in the `EntityDefinition`. However, the processing of criteria did not correctly consider `ManyToMany` associations. As a result, protections intended for `ApiAware` fields were bypassed, potentially exposing sensitive data when extensions introduced custom entities with `ManyToMany` relationships."
