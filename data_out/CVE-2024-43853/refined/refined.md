Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF) condition that occurs due to a race condition when accessing the cgroup cpuset information via `/proc/<pid>/cpuset` while the cgroup filesystem is being unmounted. The core issue is that the `cgroup_root` structure, associated with a cgroup v1 mount, can be freed while a task still holds a reference to the `css` (cgroup subsystem state) structure pointing to the potentially freed `cgroup`.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is the use of a dangling pointer to the `cgroup` structure after it has been freed.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race between the unmount operation and the reading of `/proc/<pid>/cpuset`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Exploiting the UAF can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite kernel memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The corruption or crash may lead to a denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, memory corruption can be leveraged to achieve privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  An attacker needs the ability to mount and unmount cgroup filesystem.
2.  The attacker needs the ability to read `/proc/<pid>/cpuset`.
3.  The attack exploits a race between these two operations.
-   Specifically: Repeatedly reading `/proc/<pid>/cpuset` of a process combined with repeatedly mounting/unmounting the cpuset cgroup. The provided reproduction steps involve adding a delay in `cgroup_path_ns` to increase the likelihood of the race.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create processes and read their `/proc/<pid>/cpuset`.
- The attacker needs the ability to mount and unmount the cgroup filesystem, specifically the cpuset subsystem. This usually implies some form of elevated privileges such as root or capabilities.

**Technical Details:**
- The `proc_cpuset_show()` function reads the cpuset path of a task. It obtains the task's css using `task_get_css()`. It then uses `cgroup_path_ns()` to convert a `cgroup` to path.
- During unmount, when cgroup v1 is involved, the root cgroup is freed, and it can cause a dangling pointer in the context of task css.
- The fix changes `task_get_css` to `task_css` and introduces `rcu_read_lock` around the critical section to ensure the `cgroup_root` is not freed during the read operation. The fix also uses `cgroup_path_ns_locked` which requires the `css_set_lock` to be held.
