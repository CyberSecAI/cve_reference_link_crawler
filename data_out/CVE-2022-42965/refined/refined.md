- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An exponential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability exists in the `get_file_transfer_type` method of the snowflake-connector-python package due to an inefficient regular expression.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an exponential ReDoS. The regular expression used in the undocumented `get_file_transfer_type` method is inefficient and can cause excessive CPU consumption when processing specially crafted inputs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service. By providing specially crafted input to the vulnerable method, an attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive due to high CPU usage.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via supplying arbitrary input to the undocumented `get_file_transfer_type` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `get_file_transfer_type` method which is an undocumented function, which implies some access to the application code that uses the library.
