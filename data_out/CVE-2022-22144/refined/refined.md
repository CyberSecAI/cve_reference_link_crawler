- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `prod_change_root_passwd` function within the `libcommonprod.so` library unconditionally sets the root password to "tcl-wifi" during the device boot process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded password. The root password for the device is set to a known, easily guessable value, making it trivial for an attacker to gain root access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain full administrative control (root access) of the vulnerable device. This allows them to perform a variety of malicious actions, such as modifying device configurations, installing malware, intercepting network traffic, and using the device as part of a botnet.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered automatically during device boot-up. No specific action from the attacker is required to trigger the vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device, or have a method to connect to the device via the network.
