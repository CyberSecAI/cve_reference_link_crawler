# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1459

## TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi libcommonprod.so prod\_change\_root\_passwd hard-coded password vulnerability

##### August 1, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-22144

##### SUMMARY

A hard-coded password vulnerability exists in the libcommonprod.so prod\_change\_root\_passwd functionality of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi MS1G\_00\_01.00\_14. During system startup this functionality is always called, leading to a known root password. An attacker does not have to do anything to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi MS1G\_00\_01.00\_14

##### PRODUCT URLS

LinkHub Mesh Wifi - <https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/connected-home/linkhub/linkhub-mesh-wifi-system-3-pack>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-259 - Use of Hard-coded Password

##### DETAILS

The LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi system is a node-based mesh system designed for Wi-Fi deployments across large homes. These nodes include most features standard in current Wi-Fi solutions and allow for easy expansion of the system by adding nodes. The mesh is managed solely by a phone application, and the routers have no web-based management console.

During the boot process of the device, the `netctrl` binary is launched. Within `main` the function `prod_change_root_passwd` is called from `libcommonprod` with no conditional checks to do so. This function forces a change of the root password to `tcl-wifi` as seen below.

```
int32_t prod_change_root_passwd()
    void var_d4
    memset(&var_d4, 0, 0x40)
    int32_t var_94 = 0
    int32_t var_90 = 0
    void var_8c
    memset(&var_8c, 0, 0x80)
    int32_t var_d8 = 0
    memcpy(&var_8c, "tcl-wifi", 9)
    doSystemCmd("(echo %s;sleep 1;echo %s) | pass…", &var_8c, &var_8c)     [1]
    return 0

```

The forced password change occurs at [1] when `tcl-wifi` is passed into the `passwd` command line utility.
