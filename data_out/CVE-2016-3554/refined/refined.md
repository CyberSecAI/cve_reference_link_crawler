      "notes": "The vulnerability resides in the PC / BOM, MCAD, Design component of Oracle Agile PLM. Although the matrix states that a network attack vector is used and privileges are required it also states this cannot be exploited remotely without authentication, so the attack requires local network access.",
     "root_cause": "A vulnerability in the PC / BOM, MCAD, Design component of Oracle Agile PLM allows an attacker with low privileges to compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system." ,
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient access control",
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of data, and disruption of services." ,
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network (local)",
        "Application specific interface"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires local network access to the targeted system and low privileges"
