Hi Miyagawa! Thank you so much for all the work you put to cpanm, it's an amazing tool that I use pretty much daily.

Right now, cpanm downloads from HTTP, not HTTPS, even on systems with a fully working TLS.

This patch enforces HTTPS on everything, though still allowing one to force HTTP via `--from` or `--mirror`.

We have built and tested the fatpacked cpanm with these changes and they all work really well. Please let me know if you have any concerns or if there is anything I can do to get this merged and released.

Cheers!

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I think this is good for 99% of the users out there with a working TLS via curl out of the box. My concern is that it would suddenly break the remaining 1% on their CI systems.  I wonder if it makes sense to automatically fallback to HTTP for a while and then disable the fallback as a next step. |

| Would not you face the same problem you are describing when disabling the fallback later? I would say, if someone really wants to use http, he can either set a custom mirror or use an older release of cpanm.  note: the `5.8` ci was recently removed. |

| We could also consider only supporting `SSL` but provide a more user friendly message on failures if `TLS` is not available so users are in charge and can use an alternate solution if needed. |

| [@miyagawa](https://github.com/miyagawa) we did a new commit to this PR patching `configure_http` so that it would let people know when an SSL backend is not available.  We also tweaked `sub mirror` to detect SSL certificate issues even when the client thinks it can handle SSL but the system's certificates don't exist or are invalid.  We believe this fully covers the edge cases you mentioned. Please let us know if you need any amends.  (if this update is acceptable, would you like us to also send the PR to another branch, like `master`?) |

`[Raise warnings when fail to use SSL](/miyagawa/cpanminus/pull/674/commits/3efe8e25384e3ec384b699d23e3427cecd5b621a "Raise warnings when fail to use SSL

If none of the available clients from HTTP::Tinyish support SSL
then we should die with a better error message rather than
trying to use 'undef' as a backend (which fix an error when
calling $backend->new a few lines later).

This is also adding an extra check inside the 'mirror' function.
That function is used in multiple locations without checking
directly the error status.
The goal is to detect invalid certificate errors when SSL
is supported by the backend..

Note that depending on the backend and probably client version the error
message can differ.

`HTTP::Tiny` Internal Exception raised with invalid certificates:
	SSL connection failed for cpan.metacpan.org:
	Invalid certificate authority locations error:0D07A086:asn1
	...

`HTTP::Tinyish::LWP` Internal Exception raised with invalid certificates:
	500 Can't connect to cpan.metacpan.org:443 ()

`HTTP::Tinyish::Curl` Internal Exception raised with invalid certificates:
	curl: (60) Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certificates
	More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

`HTTP::Tinyish::Wget` Internal Exception raised with invalid certificates:
	...

| Would not you face the same problem you are describing when disabling the fallback later?  Sure, but that can be done much later. I would say that HTTPS by default but allowing automatic fallback is still better than HTTP by default. Nobody would disagree that HTTPs by default and disallowing fallback is the most secure, but I am not sure if we're ready to pull that trigger *now*.  That can definitely change if e.g. perl ships with IO::Socket::SSL as a core module (iiuc there's a discussion about it in PSC). |

| [...] allowing automatic fallback is still better than HTTP by default. Nobody would disagree that HTTPs by default and disallowing fallback is the most secure, but I am not sure if we're ready to pull that trigger *now*.  Automatic fallback from HTTPS to HTTP would imho be equivalent to not using HTTPS at all, as it could allow for a downgrade attack.  That can definitely change if e.g. perl ships with IO::Socket::SSL as a core module (iiuc there's a discussion about it in PSC).  Wouldn't HTTPS support in those cases be provided by for example `curl`, `wget`, via `HTTP::Tinyish`?  Allowing HTTP (or unverified HTTPS) with an explicit `--insecure` parameter or similar would make more sense, and should accommodate corner cases like an environment that is missing cacerts or TLS libraries. |

| [@miyagawa](https://github.com/miyagawa) we have worked on an HTTP fallback, which is now [#678](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/pull/678), merging directly to master.  It contains an `--insecure` flag, like curl, that turns everything back to http-only, restoring current cpanm behavior when used. It also fallbacks to http-only whenever you deliberately use an http:// uri either directly or on `--mirror`.  If it pleases you, we can also do that same enforcement here.  Thanks! |

| [@stigtsp](https://github.com/stigtsp)  Automatic fallback from HTTPS to HTTP would imho be equivalent to not using HTTPS at all, as it could allow for a downgrade attack.  i'm aware I was being unclear. I was not promoting automatic downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP. It was only about choosing the default whether it should be HTTPs or HTTP. Once HTTPS is chosen, of course it should not automatically fall back to HTTP.  So the fallback to HTTP should only be allowed if:   * the user doesn't set a default mirror via CLI options, and * the user doesn't have a working TLS   The tricky bit here is that when the HTTP client gets a certificate error, there's no way to identify that if it's connected to an untrusted source, or if the user's TLS environment is not working (e.g. system certificates are too old). |

| I think the behavior implemented here is providing what you describe:   * the user doesn't set a default mirror via CLI options, and * the user doesn't have a working TLS   but I would be encline to ignore that discussion for now, and focus on change from [#678](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/pull/678) which is the real fix for current customers.  Note that with the current released version of `cpanm` (which does not use HTTPTinyish) it's even harder to detect if the failure is coming from a certificate error. HTTPTinyish make it easier as it provides an object (aka HashRef) which contains all information including the error message.  But you are right when there is a certificate error, we do not know what's wrong. This is why we currently rely on the user and ask him to investigate the issue, and if needed use the `--insecure` option, which can be too strong if used blindly. |

You say "at your own risk" a couple of times...

Using the whole tool is and has always been at my own risk/liability. "at your own risk" sounds like legal terms and seems to suggest there might be a time where someone else accepts the legal liability for the use of this tool.

If the aim is to say non-https is more risky than https it's worth saying "with the risks of non-secure http" or "but be aware of the risks of non-https"... Given how long cpan was non-http and non-https I'd say it might even be worth including a discussion of how risky it actually is to fetch tar balls without host verification or a secret communication channel.

There's a difference between the risks of usint the cpan cdn without https+verification and the risks of a 192 mirror without https+verification.

| Hi [@miyagawa](https://github.com/miyagawa)  The tricky bit here is that when the HTTP client gets a certificate error, there's no way to identify that if it's connected to an untrusted source, or if the user's TLS environment is not working (e.g. system certificates are too old).  I agree with the situations you're describing: hypothetical determinations like "this CA store is too old, ignore it" or similar will be fragile, and are likely to introduce vulnerabilities. A fatal error is an important feature when we cannot verify that the connection is to a trusted host.  So, do we actually need to optimize for edge cases where users update their `cpanminus`, but have a broken TLS setup?  I'm hoping an explicit `--insecure` and/or some environment variable would be a sufficient break-glass option for users who don't need secure transport when downloading and executing code from the network.  Thanks again for looking at this |

| The question is, where can one get a trustworthy CA chain from if your client doesn't have the ability to verify current day host keys?  It seems like some choices for addressing old CA chains with a newer version of `cpanm` are:   * fetch a new `Mozilla::CA` from a cpan mirror with a cert from a CA that appears in ancient versions of `M:CA`, or * hard-code cpan's PGP key into `cpanm` so it can verify the `CHECKSUMS` file(s) after a non-secret fetch or * bundle the newest `M::CA` into `cpanm` during `make dist` * bundle some hard-coded `[version,sum]` pairs from carefully chosen versions of `M:CA` so `cpanm` fetch/verify them itself   Maybe it's worth mentioning in the "could not verify host" message that maybe you need a new version of `M:CA` or `cpanm`? |

| The question is, where can one get a trustworthy CA chain from if your client doesn't have the ability to verify current day host keys?  OSes should provide a ca-certificates package and a secure way to update it. LWP and the next version of HTTP::Tiny use IO::Socket::SSL (and Net::SSLeay) to figure out the details of what CA store to use, defaulting to the OS one.  I think its preferable to use the system CA store when possible as it's updated by the OS vendor, and to support custom PKI setups that would otherwise be ignored if Mozilla::CA is the default.  Not familiar with Strawberry though.. |

| I think its preferable to use the system CA store when possible  I think that just means changing my suggested error message to include "or update your OS's ca-certs package", but at least it means there's a second, likely non-deadlocked, way out of the situation... which is nice. |

| Hi [@miyagawa](https://github.com/miyagawa) !  Patches for this security issue has been applied by couple of distributions already, like [docker-perl](https://github.com/Perl/docker-perl/commit/299f08307ad55b45f97ce323815a18809c832c89), [RedHat](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-45321), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45321.html) and others.  [A problem](https://github.com/Perl/docker-perl/issues/169) was found in docker-perl where it failed if `LWP` was installed without `LWP::Protocol::https`. It was adressed by patching out by LWP support, and instead relying on `curl`, as described in ["Note on LWP::UserAgent" section in our advisory](https://security.metacpan.org/2024/08/26/cpanminus-downloads-code-using-insecure-http.html#note-on-lwpuseragent).  I not aware of any other issues with defaulting to secure https endpoints.  Would you consider applying patches for this upstream? If so, are there anything outstanding issues or concerns with fixing this I can help with? |
