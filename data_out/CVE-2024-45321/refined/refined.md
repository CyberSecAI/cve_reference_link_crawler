Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45321:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cpanm` (App::cpanminus) tool, by default, uses insecure HTTP to download and install code from CPAN.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check**: The lack of HTTPS by default means that the downloaded code is not protected against tampering, and its integrity cannot be verified during transit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution**: A network attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept and modify the downloaded code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine when the user installs the compromised module.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks**: An attacker positioned on the network path between the user and the CPAN mirror can intercept HTTP requests and replace the legitimate module with malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the CPAN mirror. This can be achieved by:
    - Being on the same local network as the user.
    - Compromising a router or network device on the path.
    - Compromising the user's DNS resolution.

**Additional Details from the content:**
- The issue was raised in [miyagawa/cpanminus#611](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/issues/611)
- A fix was proposed in [miyagawa/cpanminus#674](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/pull/674) which enforces HTTPS by default but allows insecure HTTP with the `--insecure` flag
- Patches have been applied by various distributions like docker-perl, RedHat and SUSE
- The vulnerability is mitigated by either:
    - Using a HTTPS mirror with the `--from` option.
    - Patching the cpanm executable to replace HTTP with HTTPS endpoints.
    - Using an alternative client like `cpan` or `cpm`.
- A workaround to disable LWP if `LWP::Protocol::https` is missing is also available with the `--no-lwp` option.

This vulnerability arises from the fact that `cpanm` does not enforce HTTPS connections by default, which is a common security best practice for downloading code from the internet. The issue has been acknowledged by the `cpanm` maintainers and is being addressed via a pull request.
