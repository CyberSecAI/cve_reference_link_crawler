- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper certificate validation of the updater executable before executing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `FoxitPDFReaderUpdateService.exe` process checks if `FoxitPDFReaderUpdater.exe` is signed but does not validate the certificate's authenticity after retrieving it. It simply checks for the presence of a signature. Additionally, a normal user has full control over the `FoxitPDFReaderUpdater.exe` file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation. A low-privilege user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with low privileges can replace the original updater executable with a user-controlled, signed executable. This can be achieved by setting an oplock on the original updater executable to intercept the update process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create a signed executable and has write access to the updater file path. The attacker needs to be able to trigger the update process by clicking `Help -> About Foxit PDF Reader -> Check For Update`
