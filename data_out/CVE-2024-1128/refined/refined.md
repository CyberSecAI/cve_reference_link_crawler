Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1128

**Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of HTML input within the Q&A functionality of the Tutor LMS plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **HTML Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the Q&A section, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML code.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements:** The vulnerability falls under the CWE-74 classification, specifically "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Authenticated attackers with "Student" access or higher can inject arbitrary HTML into the Q&A section of a course.
*   This can potentially lead to altered page content.
*   While the vulnerability allows for HTML injection, it **does not** enable Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered via user input within the Q&A functionality.
*   Attackers can inject malicious HTML by posting a question or answer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least "Student" access.
*   The attacker needs access to a course where they can post questions or answers in the Q&A section.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Tutor LMS plugin up to and including 2.6.0.
*   The fix was implemented in version 2.6.1 by changing the sanitization method for the 'answer' input field.
*   Prior to the fix, the plugin used `Input::TYPE_KSES_POST` for sanitization, which was not sufficient in cases with the pro version enabled. The fix now uses `Input::TYPE_KSES_POST`  when the pro version is enabled or `Input::TYPE_TEXTAREA` otherwise.

The provided content gives more detail about the vulnerable code and its fix. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `tutor_qna_create_update` function in `classes/Q_and_A.php` and the fix consists of using `Input::TYPE_TEXTAREA` instead of `Input::TYPE_KSES_POST` if the pro version is not enabled.
