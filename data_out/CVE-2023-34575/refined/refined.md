- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The module "Opart Save Cart" (opartsavecart) up to version 2.0.7 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `OpartSaveCartDefaultModuleFrontController::initContent()` and `OpartSaveCartDefaultModuleFrontController::displayAjaxSendCartByEmail()` methods. Specifically, the `idCart` and `token` parameters obtained from user input are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89). The module fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, leading to the potential for malicious SQL code injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
  - Obtain admin access
  - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
  - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins’s ajax scripts
  - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- **Attack vectors:** Network. The vulnerability is exploited through a trivial HTTP call to the vulnerable front controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities are needed. A guest user can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious SQL code within the `opartCartId` and `token` parameters of HTTP requests. The attacker can conceal the module controller’s path during the exploit, making it difficult to detect using conventional frontend logs.
