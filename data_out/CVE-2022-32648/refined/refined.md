**CVE-2022-32648**

*   **Title:** Improper synchronization in disp
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Vulnerability Type:** EoP (Elevation of Privilege)
*   **CWE:** CWE-662 Improper Synchronization
*   **Description:** In disp, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
*   **Affected Chipsets:** MT6735, MT6737, MT6739, MT6753, MT6757, MT6761, MT6763, MT6765, MT6768, MT6771, MT6779, MT6785, MT6789
*   **Affected Software Versions:** Android 11.0, 12.0

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Race condition within the `disp` component leading to a use-after-free scenario.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper synchronization (CWE-662) leading to a use-after-free.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs locally.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires the ability to execute code on the target device and needs system execution privileges. User interaction is not required for exploitation.
