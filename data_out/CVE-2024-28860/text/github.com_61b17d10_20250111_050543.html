ipsec: fix per-node-pair-key computation

This commit ensures that

- each time we compute a per-node-pair-key we create an empty slice with
  the correct length first, and then append all the input data instead
  of appending to one of the input slices (`globalKey`) directly.
- the IPs that are used as arguments in `computeNodeIPsecKey` are
  canonical, meaning IPv4 IPs consist of 4 bytes and IPv6 IPs consist of
  16 bytes.

This is necessary to always have the same inputs on all nodes when
computing the per-node-pair-key. Without this IPs might not match on the
byte level, e.g on one node the input is a v6 mapped v4 address (IPv4
address in 16 bytes) and on the other it isn't when used as input to the
hash function. This will generate non-matching keys.
