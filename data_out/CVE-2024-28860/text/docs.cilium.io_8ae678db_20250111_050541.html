# IPsec Transparent Encryption[](#ipsec-transparent-encryption "Permalink to this heading")

This guide explains how to configure Cilium to use IPsec based transparent
encryption using Kubernetes secrets to distribute the IPsec keys. After this
configuration is complete all traffic between Cilium-managed endpoints, as well
as Cilium-managed host traffic, will be encrypted using IPsec. This guide uses
Kubernetes secrets to distribute keys. Alternatively, keys may be manually
distributed, but that is not shown here.

Packets are not encrypted when they are destined to the same node from which
they were sent. This behavior is intended. Encryption would provide no benefits
in that case, given that the raw traffic can be observed on the node anyway.

## Generate & Import the PSK[](#generate-import-the-psk "Permalink to this heading")

First, create a Kubernetes secret for the IPsec configuration to be stored. The
example below demonstrates generation of the necessary IPsec configuration
which will be distributed as a Kubernetes secret called `cilium-ipsec-keys`.
A Kubernetes secret should consist of one key-value pair where the key is the
name of the file to be mounted as a volume in cilium-agent pods, and the
value is an IPsec configuration in the following format:

```
key-id encryption-algorithms PSK-in-hex-format key-size

```

Note

`Secret` resources need to be deployed in the same namespace as Cilium!
In our example, we use `kube-system`.

In the example below, GCM-128-AES is used. However, any of the algorithms
supported by Linux may be used. To generate the secret, you may use the
following command:

```
$ kubectl create -n kube-system secret generic cilium-ipsec-keys \
    --from-literal=keys="3+ rfc4106(gcm(aes)) $(echo $(dd if=/dev/urandom count=20 bs=1 2> /dev/null | xxd -p -c 64)) 128"

```

Attention

The `+` sign in the secret is strongly recommended. It will force the use
of per-tunnel IPsec keys. The former global IPsec keys are considered
insecure (cf. [GHSA-pwqm-x5x6-5586](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-pwqm-x5x6-5586)) and were deprecated in v1.16. When
using `+`, the per-tunnel keys will be derived from the secret you
generated.

The secret can be seen with `kubectl -n kube-system get secrets` and will be
listed as `cilium-ipsec-keys`.

```
$ kubectl -n kube-system get secrets cilium-ipsec-keys
NAME                TYPE     DATA   AGE
cilium-ipsec-keys   Opaque   1      176m

```

## Enable Encryption in Cilium[](#enable-encryption-in-cilium "Permalink to this heading")

Cilium CLIHelm

If you are deploying Cilium with the Cilium CLI, pass the following
options:

```
cilium install --version 1.16.5    --set encryption.enabled=true    --set encryption.type=ipsec
```

If you are deploying Cilium with Helm by following
[Installation using Helm](../../../installation/k8s-install-helm/#k8s-install-helm), pass the following options:

```
helm install cilium cilium/cilium --version 1.16.5 \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set encryption.enabled=true \
  --set encryption.type=ipsec
```

`encryption.enabled` enables encryption of the traffic between
Cilium-managed pods. `encryption.type` specifies the encryption method
and can be omitted as it defaults to `ipsec`.

Attention

When using Cilium in any direct routing configuration, ensure that the
native routing CIDR is set properly. This is done using
`--ipv4-native-routing-cidr=CIDR` with the CLI or `--set
ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR=CIDR` with Helm.

At this point the Cilium managed nodes will be using IPsec for all traffic. For further
information on Cilium’s transparent encryption, see [eBPF Datapath](../../../network/ebpf/#ebpf-datapath).

## Dependencies[](#dependencies "Permalink to this heading")

When L7 proxy support is enabled (`--enable-l7-proxy=true`), IPsec requires that the
DNS proxy operates in transparent mode (`--dnsproxy-enable-transparent-mode=true`).

### Encryption interface[](#encryption-interface "Permalink to this heading")

An additional argument can be used to identify the network-facing interface.
If direct routing is used and no interface is specified, the default route
link is chosen by inspecting the routing tables. This will work in many cases,
but depending on routing rules, users may need to specify the encryption
interface as follows:

Cilium CLIHelm
```
cilium install --version 1.16.5    --set encryption.enabled=true    --set encryption.type=ipsec    --set encryption.ipsec.interface=ethX
```
```
--set encryption.ipsec.interface=ethX

```

## Validate the Setup[](#validate-the-setup "Permalink to this heading")

Run a `bash` shell in one of the Cilium pods with
`kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti ds/cilium -- bash` and execute the following
commands:

1. Install tcpdump

   ```
   $ apt-get update
   $ apt-get -y install tcpdump

   ```
2. Check that traffic is encrypted. In the example below, this can be verified
   by the fact that packets carry the IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
   In the example below, `eth0` is the interface used for pod-to-pod
   communication. Replace this interface with e.g. `cilium_vxlan` if
   tunneling is enabled.

   ```
   tcpdump -l -n -i eth0 esp
   tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
   listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
   15:16:21.626416 IP 10.60.1.1 > 10.60.0.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x57e2), length 180
   15:16:21.626473 IP 10.60.1.1 > 10.60.0.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x57e3), length 180
   15:16:21.627167 IP 10.60.0.1 > 10.60.1.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x579d), length 100
   15:16:21.627296 IP 10.60.0.1 > 10.60.1.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x579e), length 100
   15:16:21.627523 IP 10.60.0.1 > 10.60.1.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x579f), length 180
   15:16:21.627699 IP 10.60.1.1 > 10.60.0.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x57e4), length 100
   15:16:21.628408 IP 10.60.1.1 > 10.60.0.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x57e5), length 100

   ```

## Key Rotation[](#key-rotation "Permalink to this heading")

Attention

Key rotations should not be performed during upgrades and downgrades. That
is, all nodes in the cluster (or clustermesh) should be on the same Cilium
version before rotating keys.

To replace cilium-ipsec-keys secret with a new key:

```
KEYID=$(kubectl get secret -n kube-system cilium-ipsec-keys -o go-template --template={{.data.keys}} | base64 -d | grep -oP "^\d+")
if [[ $KEYID -ge 15 ]]; then KEYID=0; fi
data=$(echo "{\"stringData\":{\"keys\":\"$((($KEYID+1)))+ "rfc4106\(gcm\(aes\)\)" $(echo $(dd if=/dev/urandom count=20 bs=1 2> /dev/null| xxd -p -c 64)) 128\"}}")
kubectl patch secret -n kube-system cilium-ipsec-keys -p="${data}" -v=1

```

During transition the new and old keys will be in use. The Cilium agent keeps
per endpoint data on which key is used by each endpoint and will use the correct
key if either side has not yet been updated. In this way encryption will work as
new keys are rolled out.

The `KEYID` environment variable in the above example stores the current key
ID used by Cilium. The key variable is a uint8 with value between 1 and 15
included and should be monotonically increasing every re-key with a rollover
from 15 to 1. The Cilium agent will default to `KEYID` of zero if its not
specified in the secret.

If you are using Cluster Mesh, you must apply the key rotation procedure
to all clusters in the mesh. You might need to increase the transition time to
allow for the new keys to be deployed and applied across all clusters,
which you can do with the agent flag `ipsec-key-rotation-duration`.

## Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Permalink to this heading")

> * If the `cilium` Pods fail to start after enabling encryption, double-check if
>   the IPsec `Secret` and Cilium are deployed in the same namespace together.
> * Check for `level=warning` and `level=error` messages in the Cilium log files
>
>   + If there is a warning message similar to `Device eth0 does not exist`,
>     use `--set encryption.ipsec.interface=ethX` to set the encryption
>     interface.
> * Run `cilium-dbg encrypt status` in the Cilium Pod:
>
>   ```
>   $ cilium-dbg encrypt status
>   Encryption: IPsec
>   Decryption interface(s): eth0, eth1, eth2
>   Keys in use: 4
>   Max Seq. Number: 0x1e3/0xffffffff
>   Errors: 0
>
>   ```
>
>   If the error counter is non-zero, additional information will be displayed
>   with the specific errors the kernel encountered. If the sequence number
>   reaches its maximum value, it will also result in errors.
>
>   The number of keys in use should be 2 per remote node per enabled IP family.
>   During a key rotation, it can double to 4 per remote node per IP family. For
>   example, in a 3-nodes cluster, if both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled and no key
>   rotation is ongoing, there should be 8 keys in use on each node.
>
>   The list of decryption interfaces should have all native devices that may
>   receive pod traffic (for example, ENI interfaces).

All XFRM errors correspond to a packet drop in the kernel. The following
details operational mistakes and expected behaviors that can cause those
errors.

> * When a node reboots, the key used to communicate with it is expected to
>   change on other nodes. You may notice the `XfrmInNoStates` and
>   `XfrmOutNoStates` counters increase while the new node key is being
>   deployed.
> * If the sequence number reaches its maximum value for any XFRM OUT state, it
>   will result in packet drops and XFRM errors of type
>   `XfrmOutStateSeqError`. A key rotation resets all sequence numbers.
>   Rotate keys frequently to avoid this issue.
> * After a key rotation, if the old key is cleaned up before the
>   configuration of the new key is installed on all nodes, it results in
>   `XfrmInNoStates` errors. The old key is removed from nodes after a default
>   interval of 5 minutes by default. By default, all agents watch for key
>   updates and update their configuration within 1 minute after the key is
>   changed, leaving plenty of time before the old key is removed. If you expect
>   the key rotation to take longer for some reason (for example, in the case of
>   Cluster Mesh where several clusters need to be updated), you can increase the
>   delay before cleanup with agent flag `ipsec-key-rotation-duration`.
> * `XfrmInStateProtoError` errors can happen for the following reasons:
>   1. If the key is updated without incrementing the SPI (also called `KEYID`
>   in [Key Rotation](#ipsec-key-rotation) instructions above). It can be fixed by
>   performing a new key rotation, properly.
>   2. If the source node encrypts the packets using a different anti-replay seq
>   from the anti-reply oseq on the destination node. This can be fixed by
>   properly performing a new key rotation.
> * `XfrmFwdHdrError` and `XfrmInError` happen when the kernel fails to
>   lookup the route for a packet it decrypted. This can legitimately happen
>   when a pod was deleted but some packets are still in transit. Note these
>   errors can also happen under memory pressure when the kernel fails to
>   allocate memory.
> * `XfrmInStateInvalid` can happen on rare occasions if packets are received
>   while an XFRM state is being deleted. XFRM states get deleted as part of
>   node scale-downs and for some upgrades and downgrades.
> * The following table documents the known explanations for several XFRM errors
>   that were observed in the past. Many other error types exist, but they are
>   usually for Linux subfeatures that Cilium doesn’t use (e.g., XFRM
>   expiration).
>
>   | Error | Known explanation |
>   | --- | --- |
>   | XfrmInError | The kernel (1) decrypted and tried to route a packet for a pod that was deleted or (2) failed to allocate memory. |
>   | XfrmInNoStates | Bug in the XFRM configuration for decryption. |
>   | XfrmInStateProtoError | There is a key or anti-replay seq mismatch between nodes. |
>   | XfrmInStateInvalid | A received packet matched an XFRM state that is being deleted. |
>   | XfrmInTmplMismatch | Bug in the XFRM configuration for decryption. |
>   | XfrmInNoPols | Bug in the XFRM configuration for decryption. |
>   | XfrmInPolBlock | Explicit drop, not used by Cilium. |
>   | XfrmOutNoStates | Bug in the XFRM configuration for encryption. |
>   | XfrmOutStateSeqError | The sequence number of an encryption XFRM configuration reached its maximum value. |
>   | XfrmOutPolBlock | Cilium dropped packets that would have otherwise left the node in plain-text. |
>   | XfrmFwdHdrError | The kernel (1) decrypted and tried to route a packet for a pod that was deleted or (2) failed to allocate memory. |
> * In addition to the above XFRM errors, packet drops of type `No node ID
>   found` (code 197) may also occur under normal operations. These drops can
>   happen if a pod attempts to send traffic to a pod on a new node for which
>   the Cilium agent didn’t yet receive the CiliumNode object or to a pod on a
>   node that was recently deleted. It can also happen if the IP address of the
>   destination node changed and the agent didn’t receive the updated CiliumNode
>   object yet. In both cases, the IPsec configuration in the kernel isn’t ready
>   yet, so Cilium drops the packets at the source. These drops will stop once
>   the CiliumNode information is propagated across the cluster.

## Disabling Encryption[](#disabling-encryption "Permalink to this heading")

To disable the encryption, regenerate the YAML with the option
`encryption.enabled=false`

## Limitations[](#limitations "Permalink to this heading")

> * Transparent encryption is not currently supported when chaining Cilium on
>   top of other CNI plugins. For more information, see [GitHub issue 15596](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/15596).
> * [Host Policies](../../policy/language/#hostpolicies) are not currently supported with IPsec encryption.
> * IPsec encryption currently does not work with BPF Host Routing.
> * IPsec encryption is not currently supported in combination with IPv6-only clusters.
> * IPsec encryption is not supported on clusters or clustermeshes with more
>   than 65535 nodes.
> * Decryption with Cilium IPsec is limited to a single CPU core per IPsec
>   tunnel. This may affect performance in case of high throughput between
>   two nodes.
