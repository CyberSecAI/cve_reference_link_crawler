Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The session cookie in Taipy versions 3.1.1 and earlier lacks the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Secure Flag:** The absence of the `Secure` flag means the cookie is sent over both HTTP and HTTPS connections.
*   **Missing HttpOnly Flag:** The lack of the `HttpOnly` flag allows client-side JavaScript to access the cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Exposure over insecure connections:** Without the `Secure` flag, the session cookie can be intercepted during transmission over HTTP, potentially exposing sensitive session data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks:** Without the `HttpOnly` flag, malicious JavaScript can access the cookie, potentially leading to session hijacking and other malicious activities if XSS vulnerabilities exist.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** An attacker intercepting HTTP traffic can obtain the session cookie.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts injected into a vulnerable page can steal the session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **MitM:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, particularly if the application is used over HTTP.
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a part of the application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `Navigate.tsx` file of the `taipy-gui` frontend.
*   The proposed remediation involves adding the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags when setting the session cookie.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
