- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing XPS files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious XPS file or visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious XPS file or lure the victim to a malicious page. User interaction is required for exploitation.
