{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect file system permissions during installation of Remisol Advance software.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The software sets weak permissions on the service executable (ServiceManager.exe) and associated libraries, allowing non-privileged users to modify them."
    ],
    "impact": "Non-privileged users can gain SYSTEM/NT Authority level privileges by replacing legitimate executables with malicious ones. This effectively gives them complete control over the local Windows host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required. An attacker needs low-level permission to a workstation, often obtained through weak or default passwords."
    ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to write to the service executable's location and then trigger a service restart (reboot or service restart)."
  }
