Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `check_student.php` file of the itsourcecode Society Management System v1.0, specifically concerning the `student_id` parameter. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, personal information, and financial details.
- The attacker could also modify or delete data in the database, leading to data loss or corruption, and potentially take complete control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the HTTP POST request to the `check_student.php` page.
- The vulnerable parameter is `student_id`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `student_id` POST parameter.

**Additional details:**
- The specific injection technique is a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The provided payload `student_id=12345678' AND (SELECT 2119 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))fURM) AND 'Njoa'='Njoa` demonstrates the use of the `SLEEP()` function in MySQL to confirm the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable software is itsourcecode Society Management System v1.0.
- The vulnerable file is `check_student.php`.
- The vulnerability was submitted by user Dee.Mirage.
