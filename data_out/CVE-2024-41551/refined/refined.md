The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Supplier Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `view_order_items.php` page before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in `view_order_items.php` via the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion.
- The provided payload demonstrates database name exfiltration using the `updatexml` function, which allows for reading data from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed through an HTTP GET request to `Supply_Management_System/admin/view_order_items.php`, with a malicious SQL query in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
