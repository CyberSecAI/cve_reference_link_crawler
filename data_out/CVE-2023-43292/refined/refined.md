The provided content relates to CVE-2023-43292.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "My Food Recipe Using PHP with Source Code v.1.0" application. Specifically, user-supplied data in the Recipe Name, Procedure, and Ingredients parameters are not sanitized before being displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present. The application does not sanitize input, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted payloads injected into the Recipe Name, Procedure, and Ingredients input parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable application and input the malicious code into the specified parameters. The attacker is described as "local", but the meaning of this term in the provided context is ambiguous. It may refer to an attacker with local network access, or an attacker with access to the application itself.
