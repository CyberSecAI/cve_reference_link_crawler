# XStream is vulnerable to a Remote Command Execution attack

High

[joehni](/joehni)
published
GHSA-j9h8-phrw-h4fh
Aug 22, 2021

## Package

maven

com.thoughtworks.xstream
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.4.18

## Patched versions

1.4.18

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker has sufficient rights to execute commands of the host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.

### Patches

XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.

### Workarounds

See [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.

### References

See full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39144](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39144.html).

### Credits

Ceclin and YXXX from the Tencent Security Response Center found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.
