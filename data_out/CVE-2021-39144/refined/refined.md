  "CVE-2021-39144": {
    "description": "XStream is vulnerable to a Remote Command Execution attack.\n\nThe processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in execution of a local command on the server.",
    "root_cause": "An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in execution of a local command on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information."

    "impact": "The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute commands with the rights of the process owner on the host only by manipulating the processed input stream.",
