- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the file and boot variable permissions within the Cisco IOS XE ROM Monitor (ROMMON) software when the password-recovery disable feature is enabled.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Inadequate file and boot variable permissions in ROMMON. Specifically, the password-recovery disable feature when enabled does not properly restrict access to sensitive files.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, local attacker can exploit the vulnerability to:
    - Read any file on the device
    - Reset the enable password
    - Recover the configuration

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Reboot the switch into ROMMON.
    - Enter specific commands through the console.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must have local access to the device's console.
    - The password-recovery disable feature must be enabled on the affected device.
