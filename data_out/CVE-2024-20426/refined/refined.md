- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for VPN termination of Cisco ASA and FTD Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafted IKEv2 traffic. The specific nature of the insufficient input validation is not detailed beyond the fact that it is an issue with handling IKEv2 packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send crafted IKEv2 traffic to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected device's IKEv2 interface. No authentication is required.

This advisory provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, specifying that the vulnerability is in the IKEv2 protocol, involves crafted IKEv2 packets, and results in a device reload. It also details how to check if IKEv2 is enabled, affected products, and where to find fixed software.
