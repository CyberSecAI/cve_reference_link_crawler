Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect privilege assignment. The system fails to properly enforce permissions when accessing worker pools.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** Users are able to view worker pools without being explicitly granted the necessary permissions. This means the system's access control mechanisms are not functioning as intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthorized user can view worker pool information. While the advisory labels the severity as "low", the unauthorized visibility of these resources could lead to further attacks depending on the sensitivity of information within the worker pools.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A user without explicit permissions to view worker pools can access and view them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Octopus Deploy server. No special privileges or elevated access are required, just a valid login.

**Affected Versions:**

*   All 2019.x, 2020.x and 2021.x versions
*   All 2022.1.x and 2022.2.x versions
*   All 2022.3.x versions before 2022.3.11098
*   All 2022.4.x versions before 2022.4.8463
*   All 2023.1.x versions before 2023.1.9672
*   All 2023.2.x versions before 2023.2.2394

**Fix:**

*   Upgrade to Octopus Server version 2022.3.11098, 2022.4.8463, 2023.1.9672, 2023.2.2394, or any later version.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory explicitly states there is no known mitigation for this vulnerability other than upgrading.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by anjelikasah via Bugcrowd.
*   The advisory has a low severity rating, but users should evaluate its applicability to their environment.
