Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a bug in Sandboxie that allows a sandboxed program to escape the sandbox. The specific technical details are not disclosed in this issue, but it is related to object handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insufficient object filtering: The core issue is related to how Sandboxie handles objects, specifically that it does not properly filter them by default allowing a sandbox escape.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   Sandbox escape: An attacker could potentially break out of the sandbox environment. This means a malicious program running within the sandbox would be able to interact with the host system directly, potentially leading to further compromise or system damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack vector is a malicious program executed within the Sandboxie environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a Sandboxie sandbox to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- A workaround exists by enabling `EnableObjectFiltering=y` in the `[GlobalSettings]` section of the `sandboxie.ini` file. This enables enhanced object filtering that prevents the escape.
- The vulnerability was found in Sandboxie Classic v5.55.13 64-bit, and was tested on Windows 10 Home 20H2. It can be reproduced on an empty sandbox.
-  The issue is confirmed and fixed, with the fix planned for the next release.
