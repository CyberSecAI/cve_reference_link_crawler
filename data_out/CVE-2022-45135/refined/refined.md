Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, this vulnerability is present in the `DatabaseCookieAuthenticatorAction` component of Apache Cocoon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-provided input before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This can lead to:
    - Data breaches (accessing sensitive data)
    - Data modification or deletion
    - Potential denial of service if the database is overloaded
    - Possibly gaining access to the underlying system hosting the database through database specific exploitation techniques

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `DatabaseCookieAuthenticatorAction` component. Specifically, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL through parameters related to the cookie authentication process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the application in a manner that allows them to manipulate input used within the vulnerable SQL query. This might involve providing specific cookies or other inputs that are then used within the `DatabaseCookieAuthenticatorAction`.

**Additional Notes:**
- Affected versions are Apache Cocoon 2.2.0 before 2.3.0.
- The recommended fix is to upgrade to version 2.3.0.
