- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. This occurs within the `prog.cgi` component of the D-Link DIR-2640 router's firmware when handling HNAP requests via the lighttpd webserver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `prog.cgi` component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected router.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-adjacent, and the vulnerability can be triggered through HTTP requests (ports 80 and 443) to the lighttpd webserver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
