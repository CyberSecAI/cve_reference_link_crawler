The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41124.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `API_URLS` in the `puncia` Python package were using HTTP instead of HTTPS, which allowed for cleartext transmission of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information over HTTP.
- Lack of encryption for API communications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Eavesdropping on API communications.
- Data tampering.
- Unauthorized data access.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Potential exposure of API keys and other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically MITM attacks.
- An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and the API server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between the client using the `puncia` package and the API servers it communicates with.
- The attacker needs to be on the same network or be able to intercept network communications (e.g., by controlling a network router or using ARP spoofing).
- No specific user privileges on the target system are required, but the attacker needs a position in the network path.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported in issue #8 of the `puncia` repository.
- The fix was implemented in commit `033f3b6`, which changed the `API_URLS` from HTTP to HTTPS.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `puncia` prior to 0.21.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity with a CVSS v3 score of 3.8.
- The advisory was published as GHSA-rwcj-7jjp-4w38.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information).
