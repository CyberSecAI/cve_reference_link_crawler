# [PUNCIA] [CWE-319] Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information via HTTP urls in `API\_URLS`

Low

[g147](/g147)
published
GHSA-rwcj-7jjp-4w38
Jul 19, 2024

## Package

pip

puncia
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.21

## Patched versions

0.21

## Description

### Impact

`API_URLS` is utilizing HTTP instead of HTTPS for communication that can lead to issues like Eavesdropping, Data Tampering, Unauthorized Data Access & MITM Attacks.

### References

[ISSUE](https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/puncia/issues/8)

[PATCH](https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/puncia/commit/033f3b68126eabbb2040ce16e2c3a2ce17437fbd#diff-3ec6c2de51e702726b23c452e3f4a899f6f4253af9fbf5be7254a5c1407ab526)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Hey, first of all, awesome project!  I wanted to report two security-related issues:   * [API\_URLS](https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/puncia/blob/master/puncia/__main__.py#L8) are all over HTTP. An attacker in a MITM position would be able to read everything between client-server, for example, the api-key * The repo lacks a SECURITY.md, or any channel where these type of issues can be reported privately |
