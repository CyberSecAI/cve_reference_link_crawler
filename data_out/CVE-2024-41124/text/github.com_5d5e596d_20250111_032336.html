| Hey, first of all, awesome project!  I wanted to report two security-related issues:   * [API\_URLS](https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/puncia/blob/master/puncia/__main__.py#L8) are all over HTTP. An attacker in a MITM position would be able to read everything between client-server, for example, the api-key * The repo lacks a SECURITY.md, or any channel where these type of issues can be reported privately |
