Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Blind SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Root Cause:** The application (OrangeHRM 3.3.3) is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `sortOrder` parameter in the `/admin/viewProjects` endpoint. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input to this parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `sortOrder` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is blind, meaning the attacker does not directly see the query results but can infer information based on the application's response.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The specific vulnerable parameter is `sortOrder` located in `https://$HOST/symfony/web/index.php/admin/viewProjects`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
*   This can lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or complete database takeover.
*   In this case the attacker is able to enumerate database information

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/admin/viewProjects` endpoint, with the `sortOrder` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
*   The specific injection point is the `sortOrder` parameter.
*   The payload for blind SQLi is included in the description, using time-based SQLi to confirm injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, specifically an admin user, though the information indicates other users may also be vulnerable.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL, in this case, the attack is performed via the URL.
*   Knowledge of SQL to be able to construct a functional injection.

**Additional details from the content compared to the CVE description:**
*   The content specifies the exact vulnerable URL and parameter (`sortOrder`).
*   It provides the specific version of OrangeHRM affected (3.3.3).
*   It includes SQLMap commands to reproduce and validate the SQLi.
*   It provides example payloads and the type of SQLi (blind boolean-based and stacked queries)
*   It has an included demo of the exploit.
