- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Where I Was, Where I Will Be` WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion due to improper control of the filename used in an include/require statement in `system/include/include_user.php`. Specifically, the `WIW_HEADER` parameter is used without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to specify an external URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**: The plugin allows the inclusion of arbitrary remote files specified by the attacker.
    - **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The plugin does not sanitize or validate the `WIW_HEADER` parameter before using it in a file inclusion statement.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution**: By including a malicious PHP file from an external server, attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the WordPress site.
    - **Bypass Access Controls**: Remote file inclusion can be used to bypass access controls.
    - **Data Theft**: Attackers can potentially obtain sensitive data by executing malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **HTTP Request**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request containing the `WIW_HEADER` parameter to the `/system/include/include_user.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Unauthenticated Access**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
    - **Network Access**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
    - **`allow_url_include` Configuration**: The `allow_url_include` setting in PHP must be enabled on the server for successful exploitation of the RFI.
