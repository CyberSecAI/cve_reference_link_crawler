I was thinking re-probing after possible VM migration, just like you
would presumably retest a CPUID bit.  However, in this case probing can
lead to false negatives if the other thread issues a DIV too or an
unexpected context switch occurs.

Is the original paper public?

Meanwhile, I observe a difference between Linux and Xen fixes - Linux
uses native-sized DIV and you use byte-sized, as a clever way not to
clobber RDX and maybe achieve lower latency.  Speaking of which:

$ git clone <https://github.com/InstLatx64/InstLatx64>
$ grep -r ': DIV .* 0/' InstLatx64/AuthenticAMD/*_Zen_*.txt

Looks like maybe not that much difference, after all, if this data applies.

Thank you for sharing so much detail and thoughts on this, Andrew!
