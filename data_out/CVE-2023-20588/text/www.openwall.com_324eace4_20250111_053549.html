Oops.  I thought I'd fixed that, but apparently not.

You're correct.  I'll issue an update in a moment.

Not really.  That patch entirely misunderstood the vulnerability.  I
went through several rounds of getting AMD to better-understand their bug.

Linux's fix was rewritten in
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f58d6fbcb7c848b7f2469be339bc571f2e9d245b>
and this implements the same logic as I implemented in Xen.

It's worth noting that because AMD did not allocate a $FOO_NO CPUID bit,
there's no ability for a VM to figure out that it might move to
vulnerable hardware and therefore should engage the workaround.  The
best a VM can do is best-effort based on whether it looks like it's
booting on a Zen1 system.

Also the cross-thread nature is also poorly reported in public.

Thanks,

~Andrew
