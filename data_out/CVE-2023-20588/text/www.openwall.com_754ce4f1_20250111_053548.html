Hi,

Thank you Xen security team for indirectly bringing the various CPU
issues in here.  This is very helpful, as your messages on them serve
two purposes at once - informing the community about issues fixed in Xen
(so directly on-topic here, with Xen being Open Source) and about the
CPU issues that typically also need to be mitigated by other projects.

The above link is wrong - it's for CVE-2023-20593 Zenbleed in Zen2.

The correct link for CVE-2023-20588, the DIV bug in Zen1, appears to be:

<https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7007.html>

While I am at it, here's the corresponding mitigation in Linux kernel:
