These detailed security advisories are one of the things I love about
Xen.  It's hard to trust a hypervisor (KVM) that will not issue them,
for then one has no way to know if a particular problem got fixed.

I'm CCing KVM here to make sure they have a fix.  From their Git commit
history, I am almost certain that seL4 does not.  I'm CCing the seL4
developers to alert them of this and suggest that the x86 port be
removed or at least have a big warning.
