Thank you!  This is helpful, but unfortunately doesn't appear (or at
least not to me) to address the case of the remainder in its own
register being overwritten or not by a smaller DIV that doesn't produce
it in that register.  Of course, under the hood it's at least a rename
register rather than the RDX that programs see, and it's supposedly
getting a value copied from a DIV unit's internal register.  So the
question is probably about the latter register being overwritten or not.

The USENIX Security paper you referenced includes this:

I think ideally one of us should come up with a single-process
reproducer (using code from that repo or otherwise), see if it "leaks"
the remainder, introduce a byte-sized DIV "mitigation" in it, and see if
that mitigation fully works or maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the paper authors (CC'ed) have comments on this?
