Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-20588:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the AMD Zen1 microarchitecture's divider pipeline, where a single divider unit services uops from both threads.
- When a division-by-zero exception (#DE) occurs, the latched result from the *previous* DIV instruction is speculatively forwarded. This means that stale quotient data from a previous division operation can be exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Speculative Execution:** The core vulnerability stems from the speculative execution behavior of the processor's divider unit where incorrect data can be speculatively used.
-   **Shared Resource:** The fact that the divider unit is shared between threads contributes to the vulnerability, allowing for potential cross-thread information leaks.
-   **Lack of Clearing:** The divider's buffer is not cleared after a divide by zero exception, leading to the exposure of old, potentially sensitive data.
-   **Covert Channel:** The vulnerability creates a covert channel allowing threads to communicate without system calls and potentially leak data between different execution contexts, including across privilege boundaries.
-   **Information Leak:** The primary weakness is the potential to leak the quotient from a previous division. While the discussion suggests a possibility that the remainder might leak too, it is unclear from the provided information if that is the case.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can infer data from a different execution context on the same CPU core. This data could be from a higher privileged context.
- A malicious thread could obtain the result of a DIV instruction from a different thread, enabling information theft.
- Userspace can obtain the result of a DIV instruction executed in the kernel (or hypervisor) space.
- The leaked quotient could be used in a side-channel attack for password cracking or other sensitive data recovery. The severity of the attack in the case of cryptographic algorithms may be minor due to the need to guess salts, but real-world feasibility might be improved.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through software running on the same CPU core.
- The attack can be initiated from userspace.
- The vulnerability is triggered via division-by-zero exceptions, which can be controlled by an attacker in the same core.
- Co-located threads on the same physical core are needed for this attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the same physical CPU core as the victim.
-   **Control of One Thread:** The attacker needs to control one thread on the same core.
-   **Ability to Trigger Divide by Zero:** The attacker has to be able to trigger division by zero errors.

**Mitigation and Resolution**
-   **SMT Disabling:** The most effective mitigation, mentioned in the Xen advisories, is to disable Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT).
-   **Divider Buffer Overwrite:** Patches for Xen overwrite the buffer in the divider on the return-to-guest path to prevent the leak of stale information.
-   **Dummy Division:** The Linux kernel patch performs a dummy division (1/1 or 0/1) on every exit to userspace or before VMRUN in the hypervisor to clear out the divider and prevents leaking of sensitive data..

**Affected Products:**
- AMD Zen1 CPUs.
- The AMD bulletin mentions the following series:
    *   AMD EPYC™ 7001 Processors
    *   AMD Athlon™ 3000 Series Processors with Radeon™ Graphics
    *   AMD Ryzen™ 3000 Series Processors with Radeon™ Graphics
    *   AMD Athlon™ PRO 3000 Series Processors with Radeon™ Vega Graphics
    *   AMD Ryzen™ PRO 3000 Series Processors with Radeon™ Vega Graphics
- Xen hypervisor (all versions)
- Linux Kernel
- Certain NetApp products with vulnerable Debian versions

**Additional Notes:**
-   AMD has not allocated a CPUID bit for this issue.
-   AMD does not plan to provide a microcode mitigation for this issue.
-   There is some discussion on whether or not the remainder leaks as well as the quotient.
- The Linux fix was initially incorrect and rewritten, the rewritten fix is conceptually similar to the Xen one.
