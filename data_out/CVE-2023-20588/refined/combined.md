Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-20588 / XSA-439
                               version 2

             x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Version 1 accidentally linked to the wrong AMD bulletin.  This has been
corrected in v2.  All other information in v1 is believed to be correct.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In the Zen1 microarchitecure, there is one divider in the pipeline which
services uops from both threads.  In the case of #DE, the latched result
from the previous DIV to execute will be forwarded speculatively.

This is a covert channel that allows two threads to communicate without
any system calls.  In also allows userspace to obtain the result of the
most recent DIV instruction executed (even speculatively) in the core,
which can be from a higher privilege context.

For more information, see:
 * <https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7007.html>

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer data from a different execution
context on the same CPU core.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only AMD Zen1 CPUs are believed to be vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

The patches for Xen overwrite the buffer in the divider on the
return-to-guest path.

However, as with some prior speculative vulnerabilities, the fix is only
effective in combination with disabling SMT.  For the same reasons as
before, Xen does not disable SMT by default.

The system administrator is required to risk-assess their workload, and
choose whether to enable or disable SMT.  Xen will issue a warning if
SMT is active and the user has not provided an explicit choice via the
smt=<bool> command line option.

Details of the vulnerability became public before the Xen patches were
complete.  Hence the patches are already applied to the appropriate
trees.  They are:

Xen-unstable: 1c18d7377453^..b5926c6ecf05
Xen 4.17:     d2d2dcae879c^..9ac2f49f5fa3
Xen 4.16:     08539e8315fd^..de751c3d906d

Sorry, I hadn't realised we were bending the rules.  The emailing-out
infrastructure predates my involvement.

If you have a proposal for how you'd prefer it to be done, I'll see what
I can do.  Perhaps BCC oss-security, or just send out a second mail?

Thanks,

 x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

Hi, just dropping in, is this the kind of thing to where the userspace &
kernel layers need mitigation until there's microcode mitigation?  There's
bound to be more of these issues cropping up now that cstates are finally
working, meaning more people will daily-drive rather than homelab.

Hi,

Thank you Xen security team for indirectly bringing the various CPU
issues in here.  This is very helpful, as your messages on them serve
two purposes at once - informing the community about issues fixed in Xen
(so directly on-topic here, with Xen being Open Source) and about the
CPU issues that typically also need to be mitigated by other projects.

The above link is wrong - it's for CVE-2023-20593 Zenbleed in Zen2.

The correct link for CVE-2023-20588, the DIV bug in Zen1, appears to be:

<https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7007.html>

While I am at it, here's the corresponding mitigation in Linux kernel:

Maybe directly probing for the bug is an option?  Perhaps can be done
within one thread (where the bug doesn't have security impact, but is
detectable anyway, no)?

Right, I couldn't find it mentioned anywhere other than your advisory.

Do you know if only the quotient leaks, or also the remainder?  In the
below, I assume the remainder leaks as well.

I'm concerned it could affect some cryptographic code, in particular
(but in a very minor way) typical implementations of Argon2.  There's a
3-year-pending pull request to the upstream/reference Argon2
implementation that I think would avoid the issue there (by optimizing
out the divides):

<https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/pull/306>

but there are many other implementations and I guess (almost?) all use
the programming language's modulo division operation as-is.  Luckily,
the severity is minor - this would only affect the cache-timing unsafe
flavors, providing an extra (more direct and maybe more reliable?)
side-channel, and this only matters when the attacker has a copy of or
has guessed the salts (the same as for other cache-timing unsafe
password hashes/KDFs).  So in terms of threat models and attack vectors,
no change at all, but real-world (in)feasibility of otherwise-similar
attacks can vary.  No big deal, just something to improve where we can.

For others reading just the list postings and for archival, this newer
Linux kernel commit is:

Of course, the worst case is much worse like that.  If I'm reading this
right, the timings I found above are for dividing 0 by something, so
should apply to Linux's 0/1.  Xen does 1/1 instead:

<https://github.com/xen-project/xen/commit/d7b78041dc819efde0350f27754a61cb01a93496>

Luckily, the timings for 1/1 look just as good:

Right.  Great not to clobber RDX.

However, this may be another reason to actually look into whether the
remainder also leaked, and whether the byte-sized form prevents that
leak despite of it not touching the architectural register where the
remainder would be stored by a preceding larger DIV.  I expect that
we're fine here - it's the divider unit's internal register and not the
architectural register that should matter - but worth making sure.  It
could also theoretically be e.g. some buffer registers in the middle,
where the byte-sized form wouldn't overwrite the full contents.

# Speculative Leaks Security Notice

**Bulletin ID:â¯â¯**AMD-SB-7007

**Potential Impact:**Â Loss of Confidentiality

**Severity:Â**Low

## Summary

External researchers have reported that on some AMD processors a division-by-zero can potentially return speculative data.

## CVE Details

[Refer to Glossary for explanation of terms](/content/dam/amd/en/documents/resources/glossary-of-terms.pdf)

| **CVE** | **Severity** | **CVE Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2023-20588 | Low | A division-by-zero error on some AMD processors can potentially return speculative data resulting in loss of confidentiality. |

## Affected ProductsÂ

#### Datacenter

AMD EPYCâ¢ 7001 Processors

#### Desktop

AMD Athlonâ¢ 3000 Series Processors with Radeonâ¢ Graphics

AMD Ryzenâ¢ 3000 Series Processors with Radeonâ¢ Graphics

#### Mobile

AMD Athlonâ¢ PRO 3000 Series Processors with Radeonâ¢ Vega Graphics

AMD Ryzenâ¢ PRO 3000 Series Processors with Radeonâ¢ Vega Graphics

## Mitigation

For affected products, AMD recommends following software development best practices.Â  Developers can mitigate this issue by ensuring that no privileged data is used in division operations prior to changing privilege boundaries. AMD believes that the potential impact of this vulnerability is low because it requires local access.Â

In addition, the data that is potentially leaked may not be privileged, and an attacker does not have control of the division operation which determines that data.Â  We also believe impact is limited to products prior to âZen 2â based architectures and are not aware of any existing exploits based on this vulnerability.

## Acknowledgementâ¯

AMD thanks Jana Hofmann, Emanuele Vannacci, CÃ©dric Fournet, Boris KÃ¶pf, and Oleksii Oleksenko of Azure Research, Microsoft and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam for reporting these issues.

 x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

I've spent a while trying to reason about this...  I'm not sure I'm any
the wiser, but here goes.

In order for values to be forwarded to dependent operations, the
register file entries allocated to the answer(s) of the DIV must have
been marked as ready.  (i.e. it's not sufficient for it to "just" be
left on the output of the divider because there won't be a special path
sideways to other execute units.)

Furthermore in this case, a real answer from the divider must have
written back, as we're concerned here about the last DIV to have
completed, and not some other stale content which happened to live in
the register file.  (The Gather Data Sampling vulnerability from the
same deadline is an example of a vector register being marked as good
before it has been completely overwritten, hence the leaking of stale
content.)

There are two sources of #DE.  A divide by 0, or result out of range.

A sane implementation of a hardware divider isn't going to multiply the
numerator and denominator to evaluate result out of range, when it can
just look for a carry/overflow on the final iteration.  On the other
hand, checking for 0 has to be done first because the result of the
operation is nonsensical otherwise.  Indeed, this is exactly how the
8086 did it[1].

So the practical results of the divider are either a failure at the
start (which is div0) or a result at the end (which is either success,
or out-of-range).

Viewed from this perspective, it's perhaps easy to see why the div0 case
passes the prior result (i.e. nothing mutated the buffer), whereas all
other cases have put a result (correct or otherwise) into buffer before
signalling a completion of the instruction.

Either way, it's just speculation for now, and we all know how dangerous
that can be...

These detailed security advisories are one of the things I love about
Xen.  It's hard to trust a hypervisor (KVM) that will not issue them,
for then one has no way to know if a particular problem got fixed.

I'm CCing KVM here to make sure they have a fix.  From their Git commit
history, I am almost certain that seL4 does not.  I'm CCing the seL4
developers to alert them of this and suggest that the x86 port be
removed or at least have a big warning.

                 CVE-2023-34319 CVE-2023-40283

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which may
    result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost of
    lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1989

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the btsdio Bluetooth adapter
    driver that can lead to a use-after-free. An attacker able to insert
    and remove SDIO devices can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code in
    the kernel.

I did enquire about this, but the Linux maintainers and Microsoft were
distinctly unreceptive to the idea.  Not that I blame them - it's hard
enough to do late microcode loading, livepatching and activation of new
safety properties when the uarch isn't moving underfoot.

Yes, many things become racy under virt, hence why we try our best to
stick to architecturally enumerated properties.

Agner Fogh's manuals have a little more information, and importantly
give the upper bound which tops out at 47 cycles.

There is at least a 1 cycle change in latency between the byte and
non-byte forms, which I suspect is down to the non-byte forms needing to
consume an extra input register before starting.

But the main reason for choosing the byte form is indeed fewer moving
parts to worry about in the critical sections, where one wrong
instruction can render all protections moot.

You're welcome.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-20588 / XSA-439

             x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In the Zen1 microarchitecure, there is one divider in the pipeline which
services uops from both threads.  In the case of #DE, the latched result
from the previous DIV to execute will be forwarded speculatively.

This is a covert channel that allows two threads to communicate without
any system calls.  In also allows userspace to obtain the result of the
most recent DIV instruction executed (even speculatively) in the core,
which can be from a higher privilege context.

For more information, see:
 * <https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7008.html>

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer data from a different execution
context on the same CPU core.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only AMD Zen1 CPUs are believed to be vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

The patches for Xen overwrite the buffer in the divider on the
return-to-guest path.

However, as with some prior speculative vulnerabilities, the fix is only
effective in combination with disabling SMT.  For the same reasons as
before, Xen does not disable SMT by default.

The system administrator is required to risk-assess their workload, and
choose whether to enable or disable SMT.  Xen will issue a warning if
SMT is active and the user has not provided an explicit choice via the
smt=<bool> command line option.

Details of the vulnerability became public before the Xen patches were
complete.  Hence the patches are already applied to the appropriate
trees.  They are:

Xen-unstable: 1c18d7377453^..b5926c6ecf05
Xen 4.17:     d2d2dcae879c^..9ac2f49f5fa3

Regarding AMD not intending to provide a microcode mitigation:

Possibly not terribly hard, but (with my also too limited understanding)
probably not in any of the ways you suggested.

That's false.

Zen1 is still found in major clouds.  The AMD security bulletin:

<https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7007.html>

specifically lists "Datacenter AMD EPYC 7001 Processors" as affected,
and these are used e.g. in:

<https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-ec2-instances-featuring-amd-epyc-processors-are-now-available-in-additional-regions/>

"M5a, R5a and T3a instances are variants of Amazon EC2 general purpose
(M5), memory optimized (R5) and burstable general-purpose (T3) instance
families. These instances feature AMD EPYC 7001 series processors"

That was in 2021, but indeed the T3a tab at:

<https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/amd/>

still says:

"Amazon EC2 T3a instances feature AMD EPYC 7000 series processors"

T3 are the most common/default AWS instance family with Intel CPUs, and
T3a are probably the most commonly used AMD alternative to them.

I don't mean to single out AWS, I think it's similar with many other
cloud and dedicated server providers.  This is just a prominent example.

I was thinking re-probing after possible VM migration, just like you
would presumably retest a CPUID bit.  However, in this case probing can
lead to false negatives if the other thread issues a DIV too or an
unexpected context switch occurs.

Is the original paper public?

Meanwhile, I observe a difference between Linux and Xen fixes - Linux
uses native-sized DIV and you use byte-sized, as a clever way not to
clobber RDX and maybe achieve lower latency.  Speaking of which:

$ git clone <https://github.com/InstLatx64/InstLatx64>
$ grep -r ': DIV .* 0/' InstLatx64/AuthenticAMD/*_Zen_*.txt

Looks like maybe not that much difference, after all, if this data applies.

Thank you for sharing so much detail and thoughts on this, Andrew!

Oops.  I thought I'd fixed that, but apparently not.

You're correct.  I'll issue an update in a moment.

Not really.  That patch entirely misunderstood the vulnerability.  I
went through several rounds of getting AMD to better-understand their bug.

Linux's fix was rewritten in
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f58d6fbcb7c848b7f2469be339bc571f2e9d245b>
and this implements the same logic as I implemented in Xen.

It's worth noting that because AMD did not allocate a $FOO_NO CPUID bit,
there's no ability for a VM to figure out that it might move to
vulnerable hardware and therefore should engage the workaround.  The
best a VM can do is best-effort based on whether it looks like it's
booting on a Zen1 system.

Also the cross-thread nature is also poorly reported in public.

Thanks,

~Andrew

When I send advisories, I prepare two basically identical E-mail
messages: one to the project's announcement list and one to
oss-security (signing both of them). It seems like this is the most
common approach to avoiding cross-posting between lists.

I concur.  I'd appreciate security advisories from the KVM project.

I strongly oppose removal of a port/support for a certain architecture
just because some implementations of it are/were problematic.  Adding a
warning is fine.

Alexander

P.S. Demi Marie, please note that oss-security list content guidelines
explicitly discourage CC'ing other lists(*), and Xen advisories are
already stretching this.  In this reply, I am still CC'ing many of what
you had CC'ed as I am following up on your specific points relevant to
those lists, but in general let's be more careful about this.

(*) Because we may then get off-topic follow-ups from there, especially
if CC'ing project user lists or high-volume lists like LKML.  In this
specific case, we're lucky so far.

Yeah, "don't divide secret data" was not a good starting point.

Not least because the transmitter and receiver of the covert channel can
be entirely in transient execution which fails to retire.

Recovery of data from a fault with checks delayed until retirement is an
art that some got very proficient at while exploiting Meltdown.

For transmitting data, remember that Zen1 is vulnerable to Branch Type
Confusion (AMD Retbleed), and any arbitrary instruction boundary can be
poisoned to speculate for a "short" window, where short is long enough
for one load, but not long enough for two dependent loads...

... except for a corner case where the other thread happens to cause a
full pipeline flush on just the right cycle, at which point a dependent
load can initiate a cacheline fill. [1]

Combining the known attacks on the Zen1 microarchitecture, an
unprivileged userspace attacker can poison any arbitrary instruction
boundary (e.g. the early entry path prior to pushing user GPRs) to
speculate to an arbitrary destination (in kernel code) and at least
initiate a load and a dependent div (subject to gadget availability).

I have not had time to investigate the effects of a pipeline flush on an
in-progress DIV uop.  A division ought to be longer than initiating a
memory access, so ought not to complete within the window.  If anyone
does investigate, I'd be interested in any findings.

Unfortunately, direct probing is usually the wrong thing to rely on.

Under virt, one common scenario is that you boot on one system, then get
migrated to a different one.  Obviously, it's up to the hypervisor to
ensure that the architectural feature still match, but the
microarchitecture really does change.

If you probe at boot and positively identify an issue to work around,
great.  But as a VM you may not get a heads up that you changed
microarchitecture, and even if you do, you don't rescan for everything
you ran at boot.

The CPUID bits allow microarchitectural details to be expressed as
architectural, and allow a hypervisor to state "here or someone you
might move to, the following safety property does not hold."

I'm afraid I don't know.  The original paper says just the quotient, but
it also says there are no leaks across privilege boundaries.

Synthetic testing shows that a latched value in the divider does survive
across a privilege boundary.  What I expect this means is that a normal
user->user context switch has a divide somewhere in it.

Getting rid of architectural divides is a good thing (for performance if
nothing else), but it's not the only thing you need to worry about.

DIV uops are not serialising, so will execute speculatively.

Transient execution can pick up any arbitrary value in the current
address space, and dividing it by UINT_MAX will cause it to be latched
in the quotient.  This can either be picked up on the next cycle by the
other thread deliberately triggering a #DE, or at a later point on the
same thread assuming that no other DIV uop has executed.

Overall, this is minor in the grand scheme of speculation bugs, but I
have to approach every issue from the point of view of the attacker
being able to time everything perfectly.  Researchers have a habit of
repeatedly disproving people who handwave otherwise...

In general, kind of yes - it could have been that kind of thing.

More specifically, no - in this case, only kernel and hypervisor
and system configuration (disable SMT) mitigations are expected.  No
userspace mitigations, other than maybe specific algorithms avoiding
integer divide operations based on secrets where they can.  While AMD
maybe could fix this in microcode (or maybe not, or maybe with
unacceptable performance penalty), they expressed no plans to do so.

Andrew, sending a second message like Jeremy suggests works best.
Bcc currently isn't expected to work at all.  Thank you!

BTW, in this case I think the problem was actually for Xen's lists more
than for oss-security - you included xen-announce among the CC'ed lists,
and this means e.g. Demi Marie's reply was attempted to be posted to
there, while certainly not being a valid Xen announcement.  However, I
guess external messages to the announcement list are very easy to reject
on your side.  It's not so easy for us on oss-security because we've
setup some senders to bypass moderation, yet those people participate in
threads on other lists that might just happen to be CC'ed in here and
they might not notice that the rest of the sub-thread is moderated-out.

I'm not too concerned about this issue with Xen announcements in
particular - things have worked pretty well with these so far.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-20588 / XSA-439
                               version 2

             x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Version 1 accidentally linked to the wrong AMD bulletin.  This has been
corrected in v2.  All other information in v1 is believed to be correct.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In the Zen1 microarchitecure, there is one divider in the pipeline which
services uops from both threads.  In the case of #DE, the latched result
from the previous DIV to execute will be forwarded speculatively.

This is a covert channel that allows two threads to communicate without
any system calls.  In also allows userspace to obtain the result of the
most recent DIV instruction executed (even speculatively) in the core,
which can be from a higher privilege context.

For more information, see:
 * <https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7007.html>

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer data from a different execution
context on the same CPU core.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only AMD Zen1 CPUs are believed to be vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

The patches for Xen overwrite the buffer in the divider on the
return-to-guest path.

However, as with some prior speculative vulnerabilities, the fix is only
effective in combination with disabling SMT.  For the same reasons as
before, Xen does not disable SMT by default.

The system administrator is required to risk-assess their workload, and
choose whether to enable or disable SMT.  Xen will issue a warning if
SMT is active and the user has not provided an explicit choice via the
smt=<bool> command line option.

Details of the vulnerability became public before the Xen patches were
complete.  Hence the patches are already applied to the appropriate
trees.  They are:

Debian Bug     : 871216 1035359 1036543 1044518 1050622

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in
    the KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which
    may allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest
    kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which
    may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost
    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a
    time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller
    driver. A local user with access to a SCSI device using this
    driver could exploit this for privilege escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing support for the I2OUSRCMD
    operation.

CVE-2023-2124

    Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
    metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
    privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the
    device mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-2898

    It was discovered that missing sanitising in the f2fs file system
    may result in denial of service if a malformed file system is
    accessed.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3111

    The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver
    that can lead to a use-after-free. It's unclear whether an
    unprivileged user can exploit this.

CVE-2023-3141

    A flaw was discovered in the r592 memstick driver that could lead
    to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a
    device. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan discovered that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem
    could result in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference
    when mounting a malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3338

    Davide Ornaghi discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol
    implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or
    use-after-free. A local user can exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege
    escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol
    implementation.

CVE-2023-3389

    Querijn Voet discovered a use-after-free in the io_uring
    subsystem, which may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-3609, CVE-2023-3776. CVE-2023-4128

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the cls_fw, cls_u32,
    cls_route and network classifiers may result in denial of service
    or potential local privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3611

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write in the traffic
    control subsystem for the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler (QFQ) may
    result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3772

    Lin Ma discovered a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the XFRM
    subsystem which may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-3773

    Lin Ma discovered a flaw in the XFRM subsystem, which may result
    in denial of service for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in the
    KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which may
    allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which may
    result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost of
    lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi
    driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit
    this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a time-of-check-to-time-of-
    use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller driver. A local user with
    access to a SCSI device using this driver could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing support for the I2OUSRCMD
    operation.

CVE-2023-2124

    Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
    metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
    privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the device
    mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-2898

    It was discovered that missing sanitising in the f2fs file
    system may result in denial of service if a malformed file
    system is accessed.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3111

    The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver that
    can lead to a use-after-free. It's unclear whether an unprivileged
    user can exploit this.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem could result
    in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference when mounting a
    malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3338

    Davide Ornaghi discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol
    implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or
    use-after-free. A local user can exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol
    implementation.

CVE-2023-3389

    Querijn Voet discovered a use-after-free in the io_uring subsystem,
    which may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3611

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write in the traffic control
    subsystem for the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler (QFQ) may result in
    denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3609 / CVE-2023-3776 / CVE-2023-4128

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the cls_fw, cls_u32,
    cls_route and network classifiers may result in denial of service or
    potential local privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3863

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the NFC implementation
    may result in denial of service, an information leak or potential
    local privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-4004

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in Netfilter's
    implementation of PIPAPO (PIle PAcket POlicies) may result in denial
    of service or potential local privilege escalation for a user with
    the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.

Thank you!  This is helpful, but unfortunately doesn't appear (or at
least not to me) to address the case of the remainder in its own
register being overwritten or not by a smaller DIV that doesn't produce
it in that register.  Of course, under the hood it's at least a rename
register rather than the RDX that programs see, and it's supposedly
getting a value copied from a DIV unit's internal register.  So the
question is probably about the latter register being overwritten or not.

The USENIX Security paper you referenced includes this:

I think ideally one of us should come up with a single-process
reproducer (using code from that repo or otherwise), see if it "leaks"
the remainder, introduce a byte-sized DIV "mitigation" in it, and see if
that mitigation fully works or maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the paper authors (CC'ed) have comments on this?

Subject: Re: Xen Security Advisory 439 v1 (CVE-2023-20588) -
 x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

No intent?  It wouldn't be terribly hard, they could just RNG over the
register afterwards or run a 1/1 to nullify any data left therein.  The
latter would require control lines to be in place, the latter would just
mean extending the microcode instruction.  That said I could understand the
want to depricate zen1 support entirely, everyone upgraded when they could
it was super super cheap to do so & there weren't really any enterprise
users.
