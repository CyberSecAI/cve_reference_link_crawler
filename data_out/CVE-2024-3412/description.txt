The WP STAGING WordPress Backup Plugin â€“ Migration Backup Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the wpstg_processing AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
