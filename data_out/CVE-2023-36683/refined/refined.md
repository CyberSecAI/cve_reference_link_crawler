Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a broken access control issue in the WordPress Schema Pro plugin. Specifically, a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core vulnerability is the failure to properly restrict access to certain functions based on user roles and permissions. This allows lower-privileged users (e.g., contributors) to perform actions they should not be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function, however, in general, it allows unprivileged users to perform actions that should require higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin's functionality, which lacks proper access control. This allows a contributor-level user to potentially trigger the vulnerable function, as indicated by the required privilege level.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user with the 'contributor' role or lower.
*   The attacker must have access to the vulnerable WordPress installation that has the affected plugin (<=2.7.8) installed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a low severity rating and is deemed unlikely to be exploited.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
*   The fixed version of the plugin is 2.7.9.
*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A5: Broken Access Control.
