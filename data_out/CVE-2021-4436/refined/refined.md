- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `p3dlite_handle_upload` AJAX action in the 3DPrint Lite plugin lacks proper authorization checks and file validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The plugin doesn't check if a user is authorized to upload files and also doesn't validate the uploaded file content or type.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the web server. Although a .htaccess file may prevent direct access to the uploaded files via the web browser, this could be bypassed or exploited through other server vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially achieve Remote Code Execution by uploading a malicious PHP file and then finding a way to execute it.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifying the `p3dlite_handle_upload` action, and including a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
