Self-XSS involves similar application behaviour to regular reflected XSS, however it cannot be triggered in normal ways via a crafted URL or a cross-domain request. Instead, the vulnerability is only triggered if the victim themselves submits the XSS payload from their browser.  Affected Component: /churchcrm/EventEditor.php  Technical Details: The vulnerability is caused by the failure of validation of user input. An attacker can insert malicious js code, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious operations on behalf of the victim.  Proof of Concept (PoC): `<img src="invalid.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS')">`  Remediation: 1.Input validation: All user input should be validated to ensure that it conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious code. Input validation should be performed on client-side and should be designed to detect and block any attempts to inject scripts or other malicious content. 2.Output encoding: All data that is displayed on a web page should be properly encoded to prevent script injection. Proper encoding can include HTML entity encoding, URL encoding, or JavaScript escaping, depending on the specific context and data being displayed. |
