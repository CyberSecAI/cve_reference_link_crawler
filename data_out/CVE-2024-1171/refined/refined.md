Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1171

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Filterable Gallery" widget of the "Essential Addons for Elementor" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the Filterable Gallery widget, allowing malicious scripts to be stored within the WordPress database. These scripts are then executed when a user accesses the page containing the injected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page, which is then executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected page.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover/Malicious Actions:**  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially leading to account takeover or other malicious activities such as redirecting to malicious websites, stealing cookies/session data, or modifying the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin's Filterable Gallery Widget:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the way the Filterable Gallery widget handles input.
*   **User Input:** The attacker injects malicious code through input fields associated with the Filterable Gallery widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to modify content:** The attacker needs to have permissions to create and/or modify pages/posts where the Filterable Gallery widget can be used.

**Additional Details from provided content:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `Filterable_Gallery.php` file within the plugin's `includes/Elements` directory.
*   The specific changes to fix the issue involve using `esc_url()` and `esc_attr()` to sanitize the user inputs.
*   The vulnerable versions include all versions up to and including 5.9.8. The issue is fixed in version 5.9.9.
