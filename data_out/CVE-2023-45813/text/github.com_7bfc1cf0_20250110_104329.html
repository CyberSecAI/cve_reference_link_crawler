# Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in validate\_link

Moderate

[PSNAppz](/PSNAppz)
published
GHSA-72qw-p7hh-m3ff
Aug 3, 2023

## Package

pip

validators
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

[0.20, 0.11]

## Patched versions

0.21

## Description

### Summary

*The torbot.modules.validators.validate\_link function uses the python-validators URL validation regex. This particular regular expression has an exponential complexity which allows an attacker to cause an application crash using a well-crafted argument..*

### Details

[TorBot/torbot/modules/validators.py](https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot/blob/d2b89192379ad033ffc7044efff26e16ccc02d5a/torbot/modules/validators.py#L13)

Line 13
in
[d2b8919](/DedSecInside/TorBot/commit/d2b89192379ad033ffc7044efff26e16ccc02d5a)

|  | return validators.url(link) |
| --- | --- |

An attacker can use a well-crafted URL argument to exploit the vulnerability in the regular expression and cause a Denial of Service on the system.

### PoC

I have uploaded a secret gist containing a PoC (<https://gist.github.com/ikkebr/6041055314f1cfb8e65b2a1acbaae12c>). By adding one special character at the end of the user argument of the URL, the regular expression will take exponentially longer to compute.

For a string of size 10k, the regex will take 0.01s without the well-crafted URL and 1.3s with the well-crafted URL exploit.

For a string of size 50k, the regex will take 0.03s without the well-crafted URL and 35s with the well-crafted URL exploit.

For a string of size 100k, the regex will take 0.05s without the well-crafted URL and over 200s with the well-crafted URL exploit.

The regular expression used in the validators library versions [0.20, 0.11] is vulnerable to this attack. Version 0.21 appears to be unaffected, but it no longer contains a single regular expression.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or increased resource usage.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
