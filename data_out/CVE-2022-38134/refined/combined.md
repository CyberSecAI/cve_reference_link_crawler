## Description

**Happy customers are your best marketers. So why not ask them to leave a review?**

The **Customer Reviews for WooCommerce** plugin helps you increase engagement, build loyalty, improve SEO, and get more sales with social proof.

**Localized to 30 languages and installed on over 70,000 stores!**

The plugin includes an optional integration with an external service to verify customer reviews. **CusRev** collects reviews from customers and verifies their authenticity.

You can find information about **CusRev**‘s [terms](https://www.cusrev.com/terms.html) and [privacy policy](https://www.cusrev.com/privacy-policy) on [our website](https://www.cusrev.com/business/).

### 🔥 Main Features

### ✉️ Review Reminders – Make Reviewing Easy

**Customer Reviews for WooCommerce** makes reviewing simple.

You can easily set it to send out review collection emails, days or weeks after purchase. The review form makes it as simple as possible for the customer to leave a review.

It’s an easy process:

1. Your customer places an order.
2. You fulfill the order and mark it as completed.
3. After a delay (customizable by you), your customer receives an automated review request email.
4. The customer leaves a review for all of their purchases on an aggregated form. Reviews can include ratings, images, and videos to increase trust.
5. The review is posted in the standard WooCommerce review format and published on your site.

You can even choose to automatically send the customer a discount code for future purchases as a thank you.

Plus, benefit from:

* A one-page review form where customers can review multiple items in one go
* Manual email invitations for selected orders
* Manual WhatsApp review invitations via the ‘click to chat’ integration
* Personalized emails for each customer with built-in variables
* Emails restricted for particular categories of products or customers with specific user roles
* Quick and easy functionality thanks to a responsive email template and custom colors
* An Unsubscribe option
* A built-in testing tool to ensure emails look beautiful before sending
* Reminders in different languages via “qTranslate X”, “Polylang”, “TranslatePress” and “WPML” plugin integration
* Support for custom WooCommerce order statuses
* Tracking when customers open emails with review invitations and when customers view aggregated review forms

### 💸 Boost Sales – With Extra Features

Did you know that displaying reviews can increase conversion by 270%?

Reviews show that people can trust your site. Other people have bought from you before, and it went so well that they want to share their experience. That social proof is important. Customers need to know your product images and descriptions can be trusted. They need to know their bank account is safe.

Turn your visitors into customers by displaying reviews!

Plus, benefit from:

* Photo reviews (let customers upload pictures with reviews)
* Video reviews (let customers upload videos with reviews)
* Additional rating criteria on review forms to rate different features of products
* Questions about customer attributes on review forms
* Preventing spam by enabling reCAPTCHA for reviews
* Displaying a terms and privacy checkbox that people need to tick before posting reviews

* Sorting reviews by date or votes
* Review tagging
* Trust Badges that show a summary of verified customer reviews
* Built-in shortcodes to display a responsive list, grid, or slider of reviews on any page or post
* Creating avatars from initials of customer names, using standard WordPress avatars or hiding avatars completely

### 🔎 Boost SEO – The Automated Way

Google loves something new! Add new content to your site automatically with customer reviews.

Show off review ratings directly in Google searches, and boost your site’s clickthrough rate.

Plus, benefit from:

* Getting unique, user-generated SEO content for your shop – customer reviews often contain long tail keywords
* Building user-generated content (UGC) such as photos and videos uploaded by your customers
* Enhancing rich snippets and structured data markup for reviews with pictures
* Enhancing the standard WooCommerce structured data markup with product identifiers (GTIN, MPN, Brand)

### 😀 Boost Engagement – With Better Feedback

Customers believe that only 8% of companies deliver a great experience – but that can change!

Use reviews to get direct feedback from your customers. Find out the good and bad parts of their experience.

You can make business decisions based on the feedback you receive and keep your customers happy.

Plus, benefit from:

* Receiving feedback for multiple products at once with aggregated review forms
* Personalized email templates
* Enabling customers to vote on past reviews

### 🚀 Boost Loyalty – Grow Your Repeat Business

Market to your existing customers!

It’s simple: our review reminders keep you in the forefront of their minds, and offering coupon codes for future purchases gets them back to your store.

It’s easy for a customer to leave a review and receive their coupon, which creates a double whammy effect: the customer comes back for more, and you gain valuable feedback. Maybe they’ll even gift the voucher to a friend!

Plus, benefit from:

* Automatically generating new coupons for ongoing customer reviews
* Fair rules for coupon creation – customers will be awarded with a coupon regardless of how positive or negative their review is
* Automatic emails with coupons upon review submission
* Personalizing emails with coupons for each customer using built-in variables
* Fine-tuning coupon properties according to your sales strategy
* Working out-of-the-box with a responsive email template with custom colors
* A built-in testing tool to ensure emails look beautiful before sending
* Emailing coupons in different languages via “qTranslate X”, “Polylang”, “TranslatePress” and “WPML” plugin integration
* Displaying a badge next on reviews awarded with coupons to build trust between customers and your business

* Adding a tab with Questions & Answers or FAQs to product pages on your website
* Letting your prospective customers ask questions about products and view questions others have asked
* Increasing sales by answering questions and making sure prospective customers have all the information available to make a purchase decision
* Reducing return and refund requests by providing answers to common questions about products, as well as offering extra information to avoid any potential misunderstanding of product features or benefits
* Improving SEO with content created by your customers – that in turn helps search engines better understand and index your website
* Sending email notifications to customers about replies to their questions and making them come back to your website
* Displaying a terms and privacy checkbox that people need to tick before asking questions or posting answers

## Installation

1. Make sure that WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. If it is not installed, please install [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/). Our plugin will not work without WooCommerce.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress ‘Plugins’ screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress
4. Go the Reviews > Settings in WordPress admin area to configure the plugin

## FAQ

### I found a bug in the plugin. How to get it fixed?

Please create a new topic at the support forum and provide detailed information with a screenshot.

### How to get Site Key and Secret Key for reCAPTCHA?

Please visit [reCAPTCHA website](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/start) and sign up for an account. Then, you will be able to get API key pair (Site Key and Secret Key) for your website. Copy these keys and paste into the settings of the plugin.

### Will collected reviews be shown as stars in Google?

The standard WooCommerce functionality already includes structured data mark up to display your product reviews effectively within organic search results. This plugin extends the standard functionality and adds some extra mark up to help search engines properly crawl your shop. It is important to understand that having a valid structured data mark up in place makes your website eligible for organic stars in Google but it doesn’t guarantee that they will be shown. You can test the rich snippets using [Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool).

### How to customize template of the reviews on a single product page?

The plugin uses the standard reviews template provided by WooCommerce and enhances it with the reviews summary bar. If your theme requires a customized reviews template or you would like to use a customized reviews template for some other reason, it is possible to do so. Here is how to do it:

1) Create a folder ‘customer-reviews-woocommerce’ in your current theme’s folder.

2) Copy file ‘cr-single-product-reviews.php’ from ‘templates’ subfolder in the plugin’s folder to the folder created at step 1.

3) Customize the file ‘cr-single-product-reviews.php’ in the current theme’s folder according to your requirements.

### How to Change Sorting of Reviews?

If you would like to change how reviews are sorted on product pages, it is possible to do so using the standard WordPress functionality. Go to Settings -> Discussion menu and find options “Break comments into pages with X top level comments per page and the last/first page displayed by default” and “Comments should be displayed with the older/newer comments at the top of each page”. You can control how reviews are sorted and displayed on product pages by modifying these options.
