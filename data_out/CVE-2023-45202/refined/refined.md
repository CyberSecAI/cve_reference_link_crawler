Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-45202**

*   **Root Cause:** The `feed.php` script uses the `q` parameter from the GET request to redirect the user without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** The application is vulnerable to an open redirect. The `$ref` variable, which takes the value of the `q` parameter from the URL, is directly used in the `header("location:$ref?q=Thank you for your valuable feedback");` without any checks.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a target redirect location via the `q` parameter. When a victim clicks the crafted link they will be redirected to the attacker-specified arbitrary website which can potentially be used in phishing attacks, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting a malicious URL with a target redirect location within the `q` parameter of the `feed.php` script
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with a malicious redirect and trick the victim into clicking it. No special position or access is required

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

*   The `Online Examination System v1.0` has multiple open redirect vulnerabilities.
*   Three specific CVEs are listed ([CVE-2023-45201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45201), [CVE-2023-45202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45202), [CVE-2023-45203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45203)).
*   The vulnerability is present in `admin.php`, `feed.php`, and `login.php` due to the usage of the `q` parameter in the URL redirecting users to the provided URL.
