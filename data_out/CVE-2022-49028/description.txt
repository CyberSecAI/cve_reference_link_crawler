In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ixgbevf: Fix resource leak in ixgbevf_init_module()

ixgbevf_init_module() won't destroy the workqueue created by
create_singlethread_workqueue() when pci_register_driver() failed. Add
destroy_workqueue() in fail path to prevent the resource leak.

Similar to the handling of u132_hcd_init in commit f276e002793c
("usb: u132-hcd: fix resource leak")
