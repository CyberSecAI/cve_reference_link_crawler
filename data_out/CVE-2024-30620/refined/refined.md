{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow caused by the use of `strcpy` in the `sub_8C594` function within the `fromAdvSetMacMtuWan` function. The `serviceName` parameter, which is extracted from a POST request, is copied to a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow",
    "Use of strcpy without bounds checking"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution due to the overwrite of the return address on the stack. This can result in complete control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted POST requests to the web interface. The attacker first triggers the setting of an environment variable, then sends a second request with the overflowing payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web interface of the Tenda AX1803 router, typically requiring network access to the router's management interface. The attacker should have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints, which are `/goform/fast_setting_internet_set` and `/goform/AdvSetMacMtuWan`, and how to craft the specific POST requests."
