{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `devm_kasprintf()` function, which is used to allocate memory for interrupt names, can return NULL if memory allocation fails. The code did not check for this condition before using the returned pointer, potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference could cause a system crash or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the device probe stage when the driver attempts to allocate memory for the interrupt names. An attacker does not need any special capabilities to trigger this vulnerability. It is possible that this vulnerability could be triggered during normal operation if the system is under heavy memory pressure.",
    "required_capabilities": "No special attacker capabilities are needed to trigger the vulnerability. System under heavy memory pressure can trigger this vulnerability"
  },
  "patch_details": {
    "patch": "The patch adds a null pointer check after each call to `devm_kasprintf()`. If the function returns NULL, the code returns an error and does not attempt to use the invalid pointer.",
    "fixes": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ]
  },
  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-26771",
