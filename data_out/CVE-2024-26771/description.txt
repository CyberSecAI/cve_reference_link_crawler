In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ti: edma: Add some null pointer checks to the edma_probe

devm_kasprintf() returns a pointer to dynamically allocated memory
which can be NULL upon failure. Ensure the allocation was successful
by checking the pointer validity.
