Here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-3149 from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incomplete enforcement of the `trustURLCodebase` restriction within the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) implementation of OpenJDK. This incomplete enforcement allows for the bypass of intended security measures related to the codebase from which code is loaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Enforcement of `trustURLCodebase`:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce the restrictions associated with the `trustURLCodebase` system property. This property is intended to limit the locations from which JNDI can load code, but the incomplete enforcement allowed a bypass.
*   **JNDI Vulnerability:** The specific vulnerability resides within the JNDI implementation, which is responsible for locating and accessing resources via naming and directory services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary impact is the potential for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This is a severe impact, as successful exploitation could give an attacker full control over the compromised system.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability also allows the attacker to escape the Java sandbox restrictions, making it more damaging because they can then perform operations that are typically restricted in a sandboxed environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is typically network-based, as an attacker must be able to initiate a JNDI lookup that points to a malicious resource.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** An attacker needs network access to the targeted system.
*   **Ability to initiate JNDI Lookup:** They must be able to trigger a JNDI operation that targets a malicious URL from which they can load code.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation often requires a degree of user interaction (e.g., visiting a malicious website or running a malicious applet), but this may not always be required.
*   **Knowledge of system properties:** In some cases, an attacker needs to know how system properties are set in the target system to properly exploit the incomplete restriction enforcement.

**Summary of technical details:**

*   **Affected Software:** Oracle Java SE, OpenJDK.
*   **Specific Component:** Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) Implementation.
*   **Vulnerability:** Incomplete enforcement of `trustURLCodebase` restriction.
*   **Exploitation:**  Attacker initiates JNDI lookup to a malicious URL, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution and potential sandbox escape.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   Multiple sources confirm that this vulnerability is present in various OpenJDK and Oracle JDK versions.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in several security advisories and patch updates released by Red Hat, Oracle, and Ubuntu.
*   Red Hat's severity assessment for this vulnerability is "Critical" in some advisories, and "Important" in others, depending on the affected software.
*   NetApp's advisory also lists this vulnerability with a "HIGH" score.
*   Fixes typically involve upgrading to specific patch levels that address the incomplete `trustURLCodebase` enforcement.
*   Some of the documents mention that affected applications or applets must be restarted after patching to ensure the fixes are applied.
