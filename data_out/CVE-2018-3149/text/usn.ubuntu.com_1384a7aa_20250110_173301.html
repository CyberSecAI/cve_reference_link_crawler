# USN-3824-1: OpenJDK 7 vulnerabilities

16 November 2018

Several security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 7.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [openjdk-7](/security/cves?package=openjdk-7) - Open Source Java implementation

## Details

It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not properly

ensure that manifest elements were signed before use. An attacker could

possibly use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or

applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2018-3136](/security/CVE-2018-3136))

Artem Smotrakov discovered that the HTTP client redirection handler

implementation in OpenJDK did not clear potentially sensitive information

in HTTP headers when following redirections to different hosts. An attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-3139](/security/CVE-2018-3139))

It was discovered that the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)

implementation in OpenJDK did not properly enforce restrictions specified

by system properties in some situations. An attacker could potentially use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-3149](/security/CVE-2018-3149))

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly

perform access checks in certain cases when performing field link

resolution. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted

Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.

([CVE-2018-3169](/security/CVE-2018-3169))

Felix Dörre discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)

implementation in OpenJDK did not ensure that the same endpoint

identification algorithm was used during TLS session resumption as during

initial session setup. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-3180](/security/CVE-2018-3180))
