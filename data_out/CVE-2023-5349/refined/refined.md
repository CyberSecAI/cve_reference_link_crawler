Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `Magick::Draw` component of the `rubygem-rmagick` library. This memory leak occurs due to redundant calls to the `GetDrawInfo()` function within the `DrawOptions_initialize` method in `rmdraw.c`. The `AcquireDrawInfo()` function already calls `GetDrawInfo()` internally, leading to a double allocation of memory for `draw_info->image_info` without freeing the first allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak caused by allocating memory for `image_info` multiple times without freeing the previously allocated memory. The issue is specifically located in the `CloneDrawInfo` and `GetDrawInfo` functions inside of ImageMagick library, where `CloneImageInfo` is called without freeing the previous allocated one and also in rmagick code that was calling `GetDrawInfo` twice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leak can lead to a denial of service by exhausting the available memory on the system. This can crash the application or even the entire host machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Application Usage:**  The vulnerability is triggered by using the `Magick::Draw` functionality within `rubygem-rmagick`. Any application utilizing this component to draw images, particularly in a loop or high-frequency scenario, can lead to the memory leak.
- **Specifically, creating images with the `text` function within `Magick::Draw`, triggers the vulnerability**.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to run Ruby code:** An attacker would need the capability to run Ruby code that utilizes the vulnerable `rubygem-rmagick` library and its `Magick::Draw` component.
- **No special privileges:** The vulnerability can be triggered by normal users running applications that use the vulnerable library.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was triggered by a recent update to ImageMagick 6 (specifically, versions >= 6.9.12-78). The memory leak is triggered on `Magick::Draw`, particularly with the text function and `CloneDrawInfo` function inside of ImageMagick.
- A fix was implemented by removing the redundant call to `GetDrawInfo()` in `rmdraw.c`. The fix is available in rmagick version 5.3.0 and later.
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a "Huge memory consumption" issue in the rmagick github repository.
- The issue is reproducible on MacOS, Ubuntu 20 LTS, and other environments.
- The vulnerability is triggered even when the output format is PNG.
