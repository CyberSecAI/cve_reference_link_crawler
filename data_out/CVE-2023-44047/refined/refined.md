The provided content describes a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the Toll Tax Management System.

**Root Cause:** The application's endpoint `/classes/Users.php?f=save` is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized user input. Specifically, the `firstname` field is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly output the results of the injected SQL query, making it a blind SQL injection.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: User inputs are not properly sanitized or validated before being used in SQL queries.
- Use of dynamic SQL queries instead of prepared statements, which exacerbates the injection issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject SQL code into the `firstname` field, which can lead to:
    - Inferring database information.
    - Extracting data from the database.
    - Potentially performing administrative operations within the database.
    - Causing a delay in the server's response, which can be used to confirm the vulnerability and extract information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/classes/Users.php?f=save` endpoint.
- The `firstname` field in the POST data is used to inject the SQL payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft injection payloads.
- An administrator login is required to access the vulnerable user profile page.

**Payload Example:**
The provided proof-of-concept (POC) uses the following SQL injection payload in the `firstname` field to induce a 5-second delay, demonstrating blind SQL injection:
```
Adminstrator' AND (SELECT 2171 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))hgdO)-- EnP
```
This payload leverages the `SLEEP` function, to introduce a time delay, which is a typical method used to detect blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. The `-- EnP` is used to comment out the rest of the query, preventing syntax errors.
