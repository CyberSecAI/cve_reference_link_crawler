{
  "CVE-2022-26020": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The InRouter302 uses a hard-coded AES key for encrypting sensitive data stored in the nvram configuration file.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A low-privileged user can download the router configuration file which contains AES-encrypted sensitive data. Using the hardcoded key, an attacker can decrypt this data, potentially gaining access to privileged user credentials and other sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to download the router's configuration file.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be a logged-in low-privileged user on the router."
