Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3597:

**1. Verification:**
The content directly mentions "CVE-2024-3597" and describes an open redirect vulnerability in the "Export WP Page to Static HTML/CSS" WordPress plugin, aligning with the provided CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the redirect URL supplied via the `rc_exported_zip_file` parameter within the Export WP Page to Static HTML/CSS WordPress plugin. This lack of proper sanitization allows for arbitrary URLs to be passed to the redirection function.
