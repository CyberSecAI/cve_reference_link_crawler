**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the InnoDB storage engine of MySQL and MariaDB, but the specific underlying cause is "unspecified." The term "unspecified vulnerability" means that the full technical details are not disclosed in order to avoid giving an attacker information they could use to exploit the flaw. It is associated with a fix in Oracle's July 2019 CPU.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness lies in an unspecified flaw within the InnoDB storage engine of MySQL and MariaDB.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases the unspecified flaws could be exploited by local users to cause denial of service.
    *   **Data Corruption:** In other cases, the unspecified flaw can potentially lead to data corruption.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local User:** Exploitation can occur through local interaction with the database.
    *   **Unspecified**: The content from Fedora and RedHat doesn't specify the exact vector for this vulnerability.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system running the vulnerable database instance.
