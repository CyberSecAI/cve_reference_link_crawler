Navigate to the "System" >> "Users and Groups" >> "Local Groups" section.2. Proceed to create a new group, ensuring to input the XSS Payload "<script>alert (1) </script>" as the Group name. Additionally, add desired users to this group and save the changes.3. Return to the "System" >> "Users and Groups" >> "Local Users" section. Locate and click on the user that was previously selected (in this instance, the user "test").
