```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the SOAP API interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection",
    "Insufficient Input Validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of root.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability via the SOAP API interface, which listens on TCP port 80 by default.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be network-adjacent to the device. Although authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. "
