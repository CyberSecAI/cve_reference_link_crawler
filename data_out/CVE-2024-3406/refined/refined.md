- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Prayer plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating email settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF check allows unauthorized modification of plugin email settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly changing the email settings of the plugin. This could allow the attacker to intercept emails, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or disrupting the plugin's functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor crafts an HTML page with a form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, modifies the plugin's email settings. The victim is tricked into opening this HTML page, typically via a link in an email or other form of social engineering.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in WordPress administrator to visit a malicious webpage. No prior authentication is required, but the victim needs to be logged into WordPress admin panel.
