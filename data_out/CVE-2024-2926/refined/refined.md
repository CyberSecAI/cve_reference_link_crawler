Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2926

**Description:** The Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input and escape output when rendering various widgets. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to store malicious JavaScript code within the plugin's settings or data, which is then executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't adequately clean or validate user-provided data before storing it in the database.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly encode or escape the stored data before displaying it on the webpage, leading to the execution of the stored JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account takeover.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the appearance of the affected pages.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could inject login forms or other elements to perform phishing attacks on website visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin Widgets:** The vulnerability is present within various widgets provided by the Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin.
*   **User-Supplied Attributes:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts through user-supplied attributes within the plugin's widgets.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected scripts are stored in the database and executed whenever an affected page is accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** Attackers must have an authenticated account on the WordPress site.
*   **Contributor-Level Access or Higher:** The attacker needs at least contributor-level privileges to access and modify the plugin settings or insert vulnerable widgets within pages, which allows the injection of malicious script.

**Affected Components:**
The vulnerability affects these files:

*   `addons-for-elementor/tags/8.3.6/templates/addons/carousel/loop.php`
