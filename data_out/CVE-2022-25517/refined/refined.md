Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input used as a column name in the `AbstractWrapper.java` class of MyBatis-Plus. Specifically, the `column` parameter in the `OrderItem` class, used for ordering query results, is vulnerable. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-provided input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries. This is particularly present when using the `OrderItem`'s column parameter to specify ordering in the query.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The framework fails to validate or sanitize the provided column names, allowing malicious SQL fragments to be inserted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database. For example, the issue mentions the possibility of deleting tables using `drop table` commands.
*   **Potential Denial of Service:** Depending on the database, attackers could potentially perform operations that could cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Input via `column` Parameter:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `column` parameter in the `OrderItem` class which is used in the page sorting mechanism.
   For example, they can add order by clauses like  `page.addOrder(new OrderItem("name ;drop table user1;select * from user2 order by id ",true));`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to control the `column` Parameter:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the `column` parameter of the `OrderItem` when using MyBatis-Plus's query functionalities. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the application where unsanitized input is passed into the sorting functionality.
*   **Understanding of the Underlying SQL Structure:** While not always strictly required, understanding the structure of the underlying SQL queries would allow for more effective injection attacks.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the framework doesn't sanitize user-provided column names.
*   The discussion highlights a debate within the community. Some argue that the framework should prevent this type of injection, while others believe it's the developer's responsibility to sanitize inputs.
*   Some users suggest using `com.baomidou.mybatisplus.core.toolkit.sql.SqlInjectionUtils#check` for validating user inputs, which is a utility provided by the framework but not automatically applied for all column inputs.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in MyBatis Plus v3.4.3, and reported to be present in v3.5.1 as well.
*  It is mentioned that the CVE was assigned and then later the submission was deleted by the submitter.
