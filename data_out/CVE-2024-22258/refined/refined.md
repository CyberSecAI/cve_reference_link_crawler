- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) downgrade attack that affects confidential clients using the Authorization Code Grant flow in Spring Authorization Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to a PKCE downgrade attack. This likely means that the server does not properly enforce the use of PKCE and can be tricked into accepting a request without it. This would allow an attacker to bypass the intended security protections offered by PKCE, such as preventing the authorization code from being intercepted and misused, particularly in cases where the client secret might be exposed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If exploited, an attacker could potentially intercept and misuse authorization codes, leading to unauthorized access to protected resources.  
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious actor interacting with the authorization flow to downgrade the PKCE requirement, and this attack is limited to confidential clients using the authorization code grant.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the authorization request flow, specifically targeting confidential clients that are using the authorization code grant with PKCE enabled.
