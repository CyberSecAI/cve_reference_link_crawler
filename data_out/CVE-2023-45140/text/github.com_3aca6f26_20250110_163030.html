# ‚ö° Security

* Fixed [CVE-2023-45140](https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/security/advisories/GHSA-pr4q-w883-pf5x) with severity 4.8 (CVSS 3.0)

# üí° Highlights

This release fixes a security issue where JIT MFA on `sftp` and `scp` plugins was not honored. Please refer to [CVE-2023-45140](https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/security/advisories/GHSA-pr4q-w883-pf5x) for impact and mitigation details.

Upgrading to this version is sufficient to fix the issue, but please read through the specific [upgrading instructions](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/installation/upgrading.html#v3-14-15-2023-11-08) of this version.

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.

# üìå Changes

* feat: support JIT MFA through plugins, including `sftp` and `scp` (fixes [CVE-2023-45140](https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/security/advisories/GHSA-pr4q-w883-pf5x))
* feat: add configuration option for plugins to override the global lock/kill timeout
* enh: `setup-gpg.sh`: allow importing multiple public keys at once
* enh: `connect.pl`: report empty ttyrec as `ttyrec_empty` instead of `ttyrec_error`
* enh: orphaned homedirs: adjust behavior on master instances
* fix: check\_collisions: don't report orphan uids on slave, just use their name
* fix: `scp`: adapt wrapper and tests to new `scp` versions requiring `-O`
* meta: dev: add devenv docker, pre-commit info, and documentation on how to use them, along with how to write integration tests
