Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6629

**Description:**

The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the plugin's video shortcode.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes used in the `aiovg_video` shortcode. Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize or escape the attributes such as 'src', 'poster', and other video source attributes before they are rendered in the HTML output. This allows malicious code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input, leading to the injection of malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. This code executes in the victim's browser when they access the page, which may lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Redirection to malicious websites:** Redirecting users to phishing pages or sites with malware.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the website's content.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the user's browser.
    - **Other malicious actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Video Shortcode:** Attackers can use the `aiovg_video` shortcode and include malicious JavaScript code within its attributes. This shortcode can then be embedded in posts or pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to create or modify posts/pages containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `public/video.php` file, where the shortcode `aiovg_video` is processed.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in version 3.8.3 of the plugin by sanitizing the URL attributes using `aiovg_sanitize_url` function.
- The vulnerable versions are all versions up to and including 3.7.1

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a changeset that shows the specific code modification (sanitization of URL attributes) made to fix this vulnerability.
- The Wordfence content explicitly mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by Webberanaut and responsibly reported by Adam Goodlin from Wordfence.
