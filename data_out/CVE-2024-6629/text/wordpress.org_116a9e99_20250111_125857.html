## FAQ

### 1. I have installed the plugin. How to build my first Gallery?

Thanks for installing our plugin. The plugin dashboard should have all the necessary instructions required to build a gallery. Simply follow that.

For more detailed instructions visit our plugin [documentation](https://plugins360.com/all-in-one-video-gallery/documentation/).

Still, Having Issues? We are just an email away. Please write to us describing your issue using the “Contact” form available under our plugin’s menu. You should receive a reply within 24 hours (except Sunday).

### 2. Can I show my videos in a popup, slider, playlist, or something more engaging?

Yes, you can. Kindly refer to the instructions below,

1. [Popup](https://plugins360.com/all-in-one-video-gallery/popup/)
2. [Inline](https://plugins360.com/all-in-one-video-gallery/inline/)
3. [Slider](https://plugins360.com/all-in-one-video-gallery/slider/)
4. [Playlist](https://plugins360.com/all-in-one-video-gallery/playlist/)
5. [Compact](https://plugins360.com/all-in-one-video-gallery/compact/)

### 3. Can I upload large video files using this plugin?

Sure, the plugin doesn’t apply any restriction on the uploaded file size. If you’re not able to upload large files, then it must be your server configuration that is not suitable for large file uploads. Simply write to your HOST and ask them to increase the upload file size limit.

### 4. Does the plugin support third-party page builders like “Elementor”, “WPBakery”, “Divi”, etc.?

Yes. Simply, generate your shortcode using the plugin’s “Shortcode Builder” and add it to your favorite page builder.

### 5. Is the plugin compatible with WordPress Multisite?

Yes, it is. However, do not “network-activate” the plugin. Activate it only on the subsites on which you need the gallery. This can be done under “Plugins => Add New” as the Administrator user.

### 6. The download button in the plugin is not working.

The download option works only on the “Self Hosted / External URL” source type. Even if the video is self-hosted, the video file must be publicly accessible to download. So, make sure that your file is publicly accessible.

Also, the videos from third-party services like “YouTube”, “Vimeo”, “Dailymotion”, or “Rumble” cannot be downloaded.

I was looking for a more robust video solution to the default one that comes with PeepSo. A PeepSo community forum member had mentioned the AIOVG plugin to another member remarking that the support was excellent. I bought and installed the plugin right away and I’m very pleased with the plugin and the support that San Rosh gives. I highly recommend buying and installing this plugin (I got the paid version) on your site.

I just started using AIOVG last week and need a page where the user could select from a list of categories and have the page filter down to the right subset of videos, preferably without a separate “submit form” click. San at AIOVG support helped me out with the exact shortcode to use and a php function that would bypass the submit button to create the effect I need. The responses to my emails were super fast, thorough, and helpful, and I’m very pleased with the result.
Even when I had a very silly question at the end about how to change the page title of AIOVG’s auto-generated pages, they patiently wrote back and explained that you can do that in the totally standard way, and didn’t call me a dumba\*\* for asking.
I would give the plugin itself 4 stars (will graduate to 5 when it has AJAX tag filtering) but I would give support 10 stars.
