The provided content is related to CVE-2023-38991.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the `delete` method of the `ActModelController` class within the `com.thinkgem.jeesite.modules.act.web` package. This allows ordinary users to delete models created by administrator users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient access control:** The `delete` method lacks proper checks to verify if the user initiating the delete operation has the necessary permissions to delete the target model.
- **Inadequate authorization:** The application fails to enforce the principle of least privilege, granting unauthorized users the ability to perform privileged actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized data deletion:** Ordinary users can delete critical models created by administrators, leading to data loss, disruption of business processes, and potential security breaches.
- **Integrity violation:** The ability of ordinary users to modify or delete administrator-created data undermines the integrity of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web interface:** An ordinary user logged into the web application can access the delete functionality for models.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Valid user account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with ordinary user privileges on the system.
- **Access to the application:** The attacker needs to have access to the web application's interface where the model management functionality resides.
