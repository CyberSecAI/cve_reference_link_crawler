Root cause of vulnerability: The RDS module in the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) has two `setsockopt(2)` options, `RDS_CONN_RESET` and `RDS6_CONN_RESET`, that are not re-entrant.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Non-reentrant code in the `setsockopt(2)` options of the RDS module.

Impact of exploitation: A malicious local user can crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service.

Attack vectors: A local user can trigger the vulnerability through the non-reentrant `setsockopt(2)` options.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be a local user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.
