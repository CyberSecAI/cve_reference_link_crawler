|  | Name of the Affected Product: |
| --- | --- |
|  | Reportico |
|  |  |
|  | Affected Version: |
|  | Till 8.1.0 |
|  |  |
|  | Description: |
|  | This vulnerability occurs when a low privilege user is able to access and view configuration details that are intended to be restricted to admin users. These configuration details may include sensitive information related to SQL queries and other critical system settings. This unauthorized access allows the low privilege user to gain insights into the inner workings of the application or system, potentially leading to unintended exposure of sensitive data or exploitation of system weaknesses. |
|  |  |
|  | Impact: |
|  | This vulnerability poses serious risks to the security and integrity of the application and its underlying systems. By gaining access to sensitive configuration details, low-privileged users can exploit system weaknesses, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or even system compromise. |
