Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-48865.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect access control, where a low-privilege user can access configuration details intended for administrators.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:**  Low-privilege users can bypass access restrictions by manipulating the `execute_mode` parameter in the URL.
- **Information Disclosure:** The configuration details, which include potentially sensitive information such as SQL queries and system settings, are exposed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data breaches:** Sensitive data exposure can lead to breaches.
- **Unauthorized Data Manipulation:** Attackers might be able to alter or manipulate data.
- **System compromise:** Exploitation of system weaknesses can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Gaining insights into inner workings of the application**

**Attack vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `execute_mode` parameter in the URL to switch from `PREPARE` to `MAINTAIN`, gaining access to the restricted configuration page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a low-privilege user with access to the affected application.
- The attacker must have the ability to manipulate the URL parameters of the application's requests.
