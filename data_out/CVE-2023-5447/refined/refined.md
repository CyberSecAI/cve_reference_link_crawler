- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition due to the lack of a lock when accessing and freeing a pointer in the `SynHsaService` interface methods.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Abnormal termination of the `SynHsaService`, resulting in a denial of service for the Synaptics Hardware Support App.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker-controlled application calling `SynHsaService` interface methods concurrently.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute an application on the local machine that can interact with the `SynHsaService`.
