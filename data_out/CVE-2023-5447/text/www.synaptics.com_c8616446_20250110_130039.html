Synaptics Security Advisory

Synaptics Fingerprint Driver: Service for Hardware Support App - Use After Free

CVE: CVE-2023-5447

CVSS: 5.5 AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Affected Drivers

File Description: Synaptics Hardware Support App Service for Fingerprint Driver

File Versions: All versions of SynHsaService included in fingerprint driver packages
built prior to 19-Aug-2023 (see table below for details of fixed versions).

Impact

Missing lock check in SynHsaService may create a use-after-free condition which
causes abnormal termination of the service, resulting in denial of service for the
Synaptics Hardware Support App.

Background

The Synaptics Pre-boot Manager for the Fingerprint Driver is a Hardware Support App
which connects to the service. In the case of abnormal termination of the service, the
most likely impact is denial of service condition for the Pre-boot Manager application.

Technical Details

An attacker-controlled application which calls SynHsaService interface methods
concurrently can cause a race condition, which triggers a use-after-free vulnerability,
due to lack of using a lock when accessing and freeing a pointer.

At this time, the only verified consequence and most likely impact of an exploit
leveraging this vulnerability is a crash of the service, resulting in denial of service for
the Synaptics Hardware Support App.

Acknowledgements

Synaptics would like to thank Aobo Wang of Chaitin Security Research Lab for
