### Description

The W3 Total Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 2.7.5 via Google OAuth API secrets stored in plaintext in the publicly visible plugin source. This can allow unauthenticated attackers to impersonate W3 Total Cache and gain access to user account information in successful conditions. This would not impact the WordPress users site in any way.
