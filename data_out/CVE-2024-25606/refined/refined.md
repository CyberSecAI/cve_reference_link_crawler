- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability exists in the `Java2WsddTask._format` method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of XML input which allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code. This code may cause the system to access external resources or disclose sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to information disclosure (reading local files or internal resources), and potentially, denial of service by resource consumption.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via the `Java2WsddTask._format` method, specifically when processing user-controlled XML input. An attacker with the permission to deploy widgets/portlets/extensions can trigger the vulnerability by crafting malicious XML within these deployment packages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to deploy widgets, portlets, or extensions. This implies a high-privilege user account within the Liferay system.
