- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The RabbitMQ protocol used by SOAR integration for IBM QRadar SIEM lacks certificate validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing certificate validation in the RabbitMQ protocol implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  This lack of certificate validation could enable man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, where an attacker intercepts communication between the QRadar SIEM and the SOAR integration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the affected systems (QRadar SIEM and SOAR integration).
