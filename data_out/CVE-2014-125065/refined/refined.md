Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a SQL injection vulnerability in the `bottle-auth` project.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the direct embedding of user-supplied data into SQL queries. Specifically, when fetching user details within a group and when deleting user groups, string formatting was used to build SQL queries, making them susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code was using string formatting to construct SQL queries, which is a well-known vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   By manipulating the `group_name` or `userid` parameters, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code within the query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input parameters (e.g., `group_name`, `userid`) used in the application to craft a malicious payload. The attacker would need to be in a position to send crafted requests to the web application.

**Mitigation:**

The commit mitigates the vulnerability by employing parameterized queries and using `db.executable.execute()` instead of `db.query()`. This method ensures that user input is treated as data rather than executable code, thereby preventing SQL injection. The changes also use dictionary parameters to pass values for the query.

**Code Changes:**

*   In `auth/controllers/group_controller.py`, the code now uses `db.executable.execute()` with a parameter dictionary instead of string formatting to construct the `SELECT` query for retrieving users within a group.
*   In `auth/controllers/user_controller.py`, the code now uses `db.executable.execute()` with a parameter dictionary when deleting user groups, replacing the previously vulnerable string formatting method.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit includes updated unit tests in `tests/test_units.py`, and the integration tests were moved from `tests/test_auth.py` to `tests/test_integration.py`.  The unit tests still need implementation but do include a test function named 'test\_sql\_injection' which may be used to test the fix.
*   The commit message explicitly states "no more sql injection," which confirms the nature of the vulnerability being addressed.
