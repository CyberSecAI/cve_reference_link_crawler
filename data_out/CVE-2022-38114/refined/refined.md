  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web server fails to correctly process the Content-Length of POST requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "HTTP request smuggling",
    "XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to HTTP request smuggling or XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through malformed POST requests with incorrect Content-Length headers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable server.
