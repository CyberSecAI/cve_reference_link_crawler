- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Crafted data in a TIF file triggers a write past the end of an allocated buffer during parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious TIF file or visits a malicious page containing a malicious TIF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious TIF file or a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability when opened by the victim. User interaction is required.
