The provided content is related to CVE-2022-26308.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Access Control in Configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper access control within the configuration, specifically in the credential store. This could imply that sensitive information such as usernames and passwords, used for integrating with other systems, may be accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow unauthorized users to gain access to credentials stored in the credential store. This could lead to further exploitation of connected systems, data breaches, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** This would likely involve accessing the configuration interface within Pandora FMS. The attacker would need to be able to access this configuration interface, which suggests the attack would be internal, either through a compromised user account or as an internal malicious actor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have some level of access to the Pandora FMS interface to exploit the vulnerability. They would need to be able to access configuration settings.
