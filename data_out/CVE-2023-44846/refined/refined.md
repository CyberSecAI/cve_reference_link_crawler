Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-44846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `admin_notify.php` file of SeaCMS v12.8. User-supplied data is directly written into the `/data/admin/notify.php` file without proper filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary code into a PHP file through user-controlled input. This is due to the direct writing of POST parameters (`notify1`, `notify2`, `notify3`) into the `/data/admin/notify.php` file.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user input before writing it to the file, making it susceptible to code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete server compromise, allowing attackers to gain control of the webserver, steal data, or launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to the `admin_notify.php` file.
- **Manipulated POST Parameters:** The attacker injects malicious PHP code into the `notify1`, `notify2` or `notify3` POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the SeaCMS web server.
- **No Authentication Required**: The provided content does not mention any authentication requirement.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and location of the vulnerable `admin_notify.php` file.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is located in `admin_notify.php` where the following code is present:

```php
if($action=="set")
{
	$notify1= $_POST['notify1'];
	$notify2= $_POST['notify2'];
	$notify3= $_POST['notify3'];
	$open=fopen("../data/admin/notify.php","w" );
	$str='<?php  ';
	$str.='$notify1 = "';
	$str.="$notify1";
	$str.='"; ';
	$str.='$notify2 = "';
	$str.="$notify2";
	$str.='"; ';
	$str.='$notify3 = "';
	$str.="$notify3";
	$str.='"; ';
	$str.=" ?>";
	fwrite($open,$str);
	fclose($open);
	ShowMsg("成功保存设置!","admin_notify.php");
	exit;
}
```

The vulnerability allows an attacker to set `notify1`,`notify2`,`notify3` to malicious code, which will then be written to `data/admin/notify.php` and can be executed.

**Exploit Examples:**

-   **`exp: ";phpinfo();?>#`**:  This payload injects `phpinfo()` function, which is then executed when `data/admin/notify.php` is accessed, providing server information.
-   **`exp: xigua";@eval($_POST[xigua]);"`**: This allows the execution of arbitrary PHP code through the `$_POST['xigua']` parameter.
