- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `/admin/BackupSchedule` description field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper neutralization of input during storage, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send a crafted URL to a victim. If the victim visits this URL while authenticated, the attacker can steal the victim's session data or perform other malicious actions within the application.
- **Attack vectors**:  A remote attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript payload within the `/admin/BackupSchedule` description field, which gets stored. When a user with sufficient permissions accesses this page, the stored script gets executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to add a malicious payload into the vulnerable description field and a victim who has sufficient privileges to view the page with the stored payload.
