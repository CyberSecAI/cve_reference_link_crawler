Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `edit_faculty.php` file of the Kashipara College Management System. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `id` parameter, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `id` parameter in `edit_faculty.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data leakage:**  Sensitive user and system data can be leaked.
- **Compromised security:** System security can be compromised, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter of the `edit_faculty.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `edit_faculty.php` file with a malicious payload.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
The provided payload `id=(select(0)from(select(sleep(8)))v)` demonstrates a time-based SQL injection. This payload makes the server pause for 8 seconds, which is used to confirm the presence of the vulnerability.
