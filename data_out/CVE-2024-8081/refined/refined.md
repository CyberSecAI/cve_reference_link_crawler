**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of the `username` parameter in the `login.php` file of the Payroll Management System.
- Malicious SQL code can be injected via the `username` parameter and directly used in SQL queries without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain access to the database without authorization.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers could potentially achieve comprehensive system control.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers could disrupt the normal operation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `ajax.php?action=login`.
- **`username` Parameter:** The `username` parameter within the POST data is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information indicates that no login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The provided payload demonstrates the time-based blind technique using the `SLEEP()` function.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a security review of the PHP Payroll Management System.

**Suggested Remediation:**
- Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
- Implement input validation and filtering.
