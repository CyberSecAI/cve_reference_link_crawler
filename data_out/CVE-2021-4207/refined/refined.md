{
  "CVE-2021-4207": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A double fetch of guest controlled values `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.",
    "Root cause": "Double fetch of guest-controlled values `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` in the `qxl_cursor` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` values in the guest's memory space.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious, privileged user within the guest operating system."
