                 CVE-2021-4207 CVE-2022-0358

Multiple security issues were discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator, which could result in denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

For the detailed security status of qemu please refer to

**CVE**: CVE-2021-4207

**Tested Versions**:

* QEMU < v6.0.0

**Product URL(s)**: <https://www.qemu.org/>

# Description of the vulnerability[#](#description-of-the-vulnerability)

## Technical Details[#](#technical-details)

QXL, the QEMU QXL video accelerator, is a para-virtualized framebuffer device for the SPICE protocol. It is the default video device when we create a VM from virt-manager. It exposes the RAMs and I/O ports to let guest communicate with it.

```
00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Red Hat, Inc. QXL paravirtual graphic card (rev 04) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
        Subsystem: Red Hat, Inc. QEMU Virtual Machine
        Flags: fast devsel, IRQ 21
        Memory at f4000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64M]
        Memory at f8000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64M]
        Memory at fcc14000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=8K]
        I/O ports at c040 [size=32]
        Expansion ROM at 000c0000 [disabled] [size=128K]
        Kernel driver in use: qxl
        Kernel modules: qxl

```

On its RAMs, QXL implements different rings for different purposes. The space `cursor` points are device RAMs, which means the guest controls its content. In `cursor_ring`, the guest can push a cursor command to tell the video driver how to render a cursor or where to place the cursor. After we push a command and notify the device to handle the command, the function `qxl_cursor` will be called. It will fetch `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` to allocate enough space for forward use.

```
static QEMUCursor *qxl_cursor(PCIQXLDevice *qxl, QXLCursor *cursor,
                              uint32_t group_id)
{
    QEMUCursor *c;
    uint8_t *and_mask, *xor_mask;
    size_t size;
    c = cursor_alloc(cursor->header.width, cursor->header.height);
    c->hot_x = cursor->header.hot_spot_x;
    c->hot_y = cursor->header.hot_spot_y;
    switch (cursor->header.type) {
...
    case SPICE_CURSOR_TYPE_ALPHA:
        size = sizeof(uint32_t) * cursor->header.width * cursor->header.height;
        qxl_unpack_chunks(c->data, size, qxl, &cursor->chunk, group_id);

```

Return from `cursor_alloc` and it fetches `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` again to calculate size. Because cursor points to RAMS which means the `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` can be modify by guest anytime, we can race it to make them be a larger value after return from `cursor_alloc`.
In function `qxl_unpack_chunks`, due to the wrong size causing it to believe buffer `dest` has `size` space for store data. Later calling `memcpy` will cause heap overflow.

```
static void qxl_unpack_chunks(void *dest, size_t size, PCIQXLDevice *qxl,
                              QXLDataChunk *chunk, uint32_t group_id)
{
    uint32_t max_chunks = 32;
    size_t offset = 0;
    size_t bytes;
    for (;;) {
        bytes = MIN(size - offset, chunk->data_size);
        memcpy(dest + offset, chunk->data, bytes);
        offset += bytes;
        if (offset == size) {
            return;
        }
        chunk = qxl_phys2virt(qxl, chunk->next_chunk, group_id);
        if (!chunk) {
            return;
        }
        max_chunks--;
        if (max_chunks == 0) {
            return;
        }
    }
}

```
## Requirement[#](#requirement)

* The attacker needs to run as a high-privileged user
* VM need a QXL Video Device and a VNC Server Graphics

## Proof Of Concept[#](#proof-of-concept)

Use virt-manager to create a VM which has a QXL Video Device and a VNC Server Graphics

* Host OS : Ubuntu
* Guest OS : Ubuntu
* Run `gcc poc.c -pthread -o poc` and `sudo ./poc`
* The VM will crash

## Mitigations[#](#mitigations)

* Since the PoC must be run at high-privileged on the guest OS, Do not run untrusted code or driver in guest OS.

* 2022-03-28 Vendor patched

Multiple security issues were discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator, which could result in denial of service or the the execution
of arbitrary code.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

For the detailed security status of qemu please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/qemu>
