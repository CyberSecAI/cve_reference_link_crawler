A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2022-08-31 02:55:52 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

The bugzilla entry say [CVE-2021-4207](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4207) while <https://starlabs.sg/advisories/22-4207/> say it's [CVE-2022-4207](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-4207). I assume this was Red Hat assigned and so given the disclosure timeline as well mentioned in the blog article the 2021 one is the correct one?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2036966#c8)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-04-07 08:02:05 UTC  ``` You're right, [CVE-2021-4207](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4207) is the correct CVE id.

The fixed advisory is 21-4207 which is now listed on the main Advisories page: <https://starlabs.sg/advisories>.
