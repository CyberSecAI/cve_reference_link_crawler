The provided content is related to CVE-2024-25891.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the failure of the backend to effectively validate user input. Specifically, the `CurrentFundraiser` GET parameter within `/Reports/FRCertificates.php`, `/Reports/FRBidSheets.php`, and `/Reports/FRCatalog.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Attackers can spoof identity.
*   Attackers can tamper with existing data.
*   Attackers can cause repudiation issues (e.g., voiding transactions, changing balances).
*   Attackers can disclose all data on the system.
*   Attackers can destroy data or make it unavailable.
*   Attackers can become administrators of the database server.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `CurrentFundraiser` GET parameter in the following URLs:
*   `/Reports/FRCertificates.php?CurrentFundraiser=<malicious_sql>`
*   `/Reports/FRBidSheets.php?CurrentFundraiser=<malicious_sql>`
*   `/Reports/FRCatalog.php?CurrentFundraiser=<malicious_sql>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoints. No authentication is explicitly mentioned, so it's likely the attacker doesn't require any specific privileges.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in ChurchCRM v5.5.0.
*   The issue was fixed in pull request #7014, which sanitizes the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter and uses ORM to get fundraiser data.
*   The provided proof of concept includes boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection payloads.
