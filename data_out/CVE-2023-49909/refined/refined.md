{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `http_sche_saveAssocSsid` function in the web interface of TP-Link EAP225 and EAP115 devices uses `strcpy_until` to copy POST parameters into stack buffers without proper bounds checking, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `strcpy_until` function when handling the 'action' parameter in `http_sche_saveAssocSsid` function.",
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in `strncpy` calls while copying 'ssid' and 'profile' parameters into the `wrpOpDo_params` structure in the EAP225 device.",
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in `strncpy` calls while copying 'ssid' and 'profile' parameters into the `wrpOpDo_params` structure via pointers `p_wrpOpDo_ssid` and `p_wrpOpDo_profile` in the EAP115 device."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution. By overflowing the stack buffers, an attacker can overwrite the return address and gain control of program execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/data/scheduler.association.json` endpoint.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrative user to send the malicious HTTP request."
