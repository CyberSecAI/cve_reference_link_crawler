Based on the provided information, all of the commits are related to the same vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `smb2_new_read_req()` function within the SMB client implementation of the Linux kernel.
- When RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) is used and the `rdma_readwrite_threshold` is reached, the function attempts to use `rdata` without verifying if it's NULL.
- The `rdata` variable, containing RDMA related parameters, can be NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference. Specifically, the code directly accesses `rdata` without checking if it is null.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A null pointer dereference would cause a kernel crash (denial of service).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an SMB client initiates a read operation using RDMA and the `rdma_readwrite_threshold` is reached which would lead to the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger an SMB read operation against a server using RDMA and reach the specified threshold. This would imply control over the SMB server and connection parameters.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix introduces a check for `rdata` before attempting to use it. The condition `if (rdata && smb3_use_rdma_offload(io_parms))` ensures that the RDMA-related code is only executed if `rdata` is not NULL.
- The fix was backported to multiple stable kernel versions
- The commit message clearly indicates that this was a fix for a null pointer dereference issue.
