- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the Brocade SANnav software including the SANnav password in clear text within the support save logs when a user schedules a switch "supportsave".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the storage of the SANnav password in clear text within the supportsave logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the supportsave logs could gain access to the SANnav password, potentially allowing them unauthorized access and control of the SANnav system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves accessing the supportsave logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs access to the supportsave logs generated by Brocade SANnav. This could be achieved if the attacker has local access to the system or access through a network share or other means, depending on the system's configuration. The attacker needs to be a user that can schedule a switch supportsave.
