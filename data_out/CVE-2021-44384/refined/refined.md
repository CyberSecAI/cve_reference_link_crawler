{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `SetPtzTattern`'s JSON `param` parser assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object, but it does not validate this assumption. When a string or other non-object is provided as the `param`, it leads to an assertion failure due to accessing the `param` using the subscription operator as if it was an object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The code does not validate the type of the 'param' JSON element before accessing it as an object.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). The assertion failure causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, leading to a device reboot.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON body that includes the `SetPtzTattern` command and a non-object value for the 'param' field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. While most of these vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, it is possible to bypass authentication using a separate vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420)."
