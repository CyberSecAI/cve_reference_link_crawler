Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the login mechanism of the PHPGurukul Online Course Registration System version 3.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user inputs (specifically the `username` and `password` parameters) before using them in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting a specific SQL payload (`'or 1=1-- -` for the username), an attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP request to the login page (`http://localhost/onlinecourse/admin/`) with the malicious SQL payload in the `username` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.
