- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Reusable Blocks Extended Plugin (<= 0.9) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force a logged-in user with higher privileges to perform unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications, data manipulation, or other harmful activities on the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will execute actions on the WordPress site without the user's explicit consent. This can be achieved through various means like phishing or malicious links.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering the malicious request while logged into the WordPress site. The attacker doesn't need direct access to the WordPress backend but needs to convince a valid user to unknowingly submit a crafted request.
