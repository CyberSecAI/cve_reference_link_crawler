Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8246:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC)" plugin not properly restricting access to set the default role on registration forms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Privilege Management:** The plugin allows users with contributor-level access or higher to set a custom role for new registrations.
- **Insufficient Role Validation:** The plugin fails to properly validate whether a user has the capability to promote users when setting a new user role on a registration form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with contributor-level or higher access can create a registration form that assigns the administrator role to new users. By registering through this form, the attacker can gain administrative privileges on the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access.
- The attacker creates a registration form using the vulnerable plugin and configures it to assign a high-privilege role to new users (e.g. administrator).
- The attacker, or another user, registers through this form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with a minimum of 'Contributor' role privileges.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create registration forms using the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details**

The provided changeset shows that the fix implemented in version 2.8.12 involves a check to determine if the selected new user role has the `edit_posts` capability and if the current user can `promote_users`. If the selected role has the `edit_posts` capability but the current user cannot `promote_users`, then the new user role is set to 'subscriber'. This prevents lower-level users from creating forms that register new users as administrators.
