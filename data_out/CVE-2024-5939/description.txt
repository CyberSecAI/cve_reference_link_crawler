The GiveWP â€“ Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'setup_wizard' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the setup wizard administrative pages.
