Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue in the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) Bootloader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **TOCTOU:** The ASP bootloader verifies the SPI ROM records, but there is a window of time after the verification where an attacker with physical access can tamper with these records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Tampering with SPI ROM records could lead to the exposure of sensitive information stored within the ROM.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Manipulation of the records could cause the system to malfunction or become unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the system to manipulate the SPI ROM after the initial verification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the device to manipulate the SPI ROM.
*   **Privilege:** The attacker would require a privileged access or the ability to execute code to exploit.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
*   The provided documents also mention the affected AMD products including EPYC Embedded, Ryzen Embedded and Ryzen desktop and mobile processors, as well as the mitigation versions for the Platform Initialization (PI) firmware.

In summary, CVE-2023-20521 describes a vulnerability where a physically present attacker can exploit a TOCTOU vulnerability in the ASP bootloader to tamper with SPI ROM records after verification, potentially leading to a loss of confidentiality or a denial of service.
