Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-30721:

**CVE-2023-30721: Insertion of sensitive information into log vulnerability in Locksettings**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insertion of sensitive information into the device's log within the Locksettings component. Specifically, lock screen match information was being logged, which could expose it to attackers with access to the logs.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of sensitive lock screen match information in the log output.
*   **Impact:** A privileged local attacker could potentially gain access to lock screen match information by analyzing the device logs. This could be used to bypass or compromise lock screen security.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves a privileged local attacker gaining access to the device's log and analyzing it to find the leaked lock screen match information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a local user with sufficient privileges to access device logs.

This vulnerability is listed under the **SMR-SEP-2023** security update, specifically as **SVE-2023-1059 (CVE-2023-30721)**. The provided text states, "The patch modifies the conditions under the information is printed in the device log."
