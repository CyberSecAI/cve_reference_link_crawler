- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap double-free vulnerability exists in the VirtualBox.exe process when shared folders are enabled in the guest operating system. This is triggered by specific sequences of `NtQueryDirectoryFile` system calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap double-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the Virtual Machine. The exploit also mentions the potential for arbitrary code execution on the host, making it a high-severity issue.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by an unprivileged ring-3 process running in a Windows guest operating system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a guest operating system with shared folders enabled, and have access to a shared directory. The attacker needs to trigger two `NtQueryDirectoryFile` system calls against a shared subdirectory: the first with the `ReturnSingleEntry` argument set to `FALSE`, and the second with `ReturnSingleEntry=TRUE`.
