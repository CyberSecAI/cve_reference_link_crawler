Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Groups Display Name" field within Bonitasoft. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The injected script is stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking/cookie stealing
    - Defacement of the application
    - Phishing attacks
    - Other malicious actions within the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious payload injection: The attacker injects a crafted XSS payload into the "Groups Display Name" field.
- Triggering the payload: The payload is executed when a user navigates to any userâ€™s profile > Profile/memberships > Add Membership > Select Group, displaying the group name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the Bonitasoft application: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify group settings in the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Bonitasoft versions: 7.14 to 7.14.7, 7.15.0 to 7.15.6, 8.0.0 to 8.0.2, and 9.0.0 to 9.0.1.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Bonitasoft versions: 9.0.2, 8.0.3, 7.15.7, and 7.14.8.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a payload into the "Groups Display Name" field.
