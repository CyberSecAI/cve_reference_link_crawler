The provided content relates to a fix for a potential issue in the Linux kernel's `static_call_module_notify()` function. Specifically, the issue was that a `WARN_ON()` was triggered when memory allocation failed in `__static_call_add_module()`. This `WARN_ON()` could cause a system panic if `panic_on_warn` was set. The fix replaces the `WARN_ON()` with a `pr_warn()`, which is a non-fatal warning.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The use of `WARN_ON()` in `static_call_module_notify()` when memory allocation fails in `__static_call_add_module()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The kernel could potentially panic due to a memory allocation failure if `panic_on_warn` is enabled, leading to a denial of service.
- A non-fatal error was being treated as a fatal one when `panic_on_warn` was set.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash (kernel panic) if `panic_on_warn` is set. This is a denial of service vulnerability

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a module load that would lead to a memory allocation failure during static call setup, and that the panic_on_warn option was set.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to load modules.
- `panic_on_warn` set.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was present in the `static_call_module_notify` function, specifically within the `MODULE_STATE_COMING` case.
- The problematic `WARN_ON()` was triggered after a call to `static_call_add_module` failed due to memory allocation issues.
- The fix replaces `WARN(1, "Failed to allocate memory for static calls");` with `pr_warn("Failed to allocate memory for static calls\n");`.
- The commit messages clearly state the problem and solution.
- The fix has been backported across various stable branches.
