## Description

Ensure GDPR compliance effortlessly with our advanced scanner that meticulously checks your website for cookies, external resources, and security issues. Generate detailed reports for validation and peace of mind. The Consent Manager works in parallel with more solutions developed by GDPR-extensions.com, where you can add GDPR-compliant YouTube, YouTube Shorts, Vimeo, TikTok, Google Reviews content elements, and more! For the full solution to work efficiently and for more control over managing your website, you should also install the GDPR Consent Manager WordPress extension.

### Custom Sections

### GDPR Consent Manager

The GDPR Consent Manager provides an easy way to manage cookies and external resources for your website and connected plugins. It now includes additional customization options to control how cookies and privacy statements are handled on your site.

1. In the WordPress admin dashboard, locate and click on “GDPR Consent Manager” in the left-hand menu.
2. Inside the “GDPR Consent Manager,” you will see two tabs: one for websites and the other for schedulers.
3. Click on the update for a specific site, and you will be able to see two tabs: one for site connection & status and the other for the cookies widget. From the connection & status tab, you will be able to connect your website to the dashboard. From the cookie widget, you can manage and customize cookies.

### New Customization Methods for Privacy Statement & Consent Manager

This update introduces a new method for customizing both the consent manager and privacy statement:

– **Consent Manager Customization:** Now allows deeper integration for customizing consent management popups, layout, and appearance.

– **Privacy Statement Customization:** Easily adjust the text and style of your privacy statement directly through the plugin interface.

### How it Works

**Add Your Website:**

– Sign up on gdpr-extensions.com dashboard (https://dashboard.gdpr-extensions.com/).

– Visit the websites page.

– Add your website Title and URL.

– A unique API key is generated for your website, allowing you to connect it to the plugin.

**Scan Your Website:**

– Visit the GDPR Scanner Tool on our dashboard (https://dashboard.gdpr-extensions.com/).

– Start a new scan.

– Select the website you would like to scan.

– Supports multi-site scanning with site map solution or our advanced crawler scanner.

– A report is generated with the cookies and external resources found on the website(s) you scanned.

**Generate Your Privacy Statement:**

– After scanning your website, navigate to the “GDPR Scanner Tool” section in your dashboard.

– Go to the **Privacy Statement Generator** tab.

– Click on Generate Statement and then select the website.

– Choose from 4 Ready-made templates that suit your website’s needs.

– Customize the content according to the structure of the selected template.

– Once you’re satisfied with the customization, create your Privacy Statement.

– Copy the generated API key from the dashboard and connect it in the plugin settings.

– Finally, run the scheduler to sync the Privacy Statement with your WordPress site.

### Scheduler Functionality

The plugin includes two schedulers to automate tasks:

1. **GDPR Cookies Scanner Report:** Fetches and syncs the cookies and external resources report.

2. **Privacy Statement:** Fetches and syncs the customized privacy statement created via the Privacy Statement Generator.

Both schedulers allow for automatic updates, ensuring your website remains compliant and up-to-date.

#### Can I customize the description of cookies?

A: Yes, if you have GDPR Consent Manager installed, you can customize the style and text of the cookies for specific plugins.

### Third-Party Service

The GDPR-Extensions-com – Consent Manager plugin enhances user privacy by providing a comprehensive solution for managing cookies on WordPress websites.
