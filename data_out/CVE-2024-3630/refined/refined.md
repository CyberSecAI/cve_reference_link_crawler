- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A high-privilege user (e.g., administrator) can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves adding a crafted payload within the "Title" field of the "HL Twitter" widget.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, to add/modify widgets.
