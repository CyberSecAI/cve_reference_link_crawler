Root cause of vulnerability: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Broken Access Control.

Impact of exploitation: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

Attack vectors: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves a function within the GetPaid WordPress plugin that lacks proper access control checks.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user, specifically a "Contributor" level user in WordPress.
