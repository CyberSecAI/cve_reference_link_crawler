- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Extra User Details plugin (versions <= 0.5) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can lead to unauthorized actions being performed by an authenticated user without their consent. Specific impacts would vary depending on the actions available in the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack. An attacker would need to craft a malicious request that a logged-in user would unknowingly execute, for instance through a malicious website or link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into executing a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
