The identified risks include: Unauthorized Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive user information, including personal details and medical records, leading to privacy breaches and confidentiality violations. Data Modification: The ability to manipulate user data enables attackers to tamper with records, potentially causing misinformation, incorrect treatments, and compromised patient care. Account Takeover: With the capability to change user credentials, attackers can hijack legitimate user accounts, leading to identity theft, fraudulent activities, and loss of trust in the system. Non-compliance: Exploiting these vulnerabilities may result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), exposing the organization to legal liabilities and financial penalties. Risks This security vulnerability exposes user information to unauthorized access and modifications.

<p>In the above SQL queries, the $id value received from the user is directly included in the query and security checks are not performed. This allows exploiting another user’s information. At the same time, since the user’s identity is obtained from the POST data, the attacker can pass his identity as another user’s identity.</p>

<h2 id="vulnerability-description">Vulnerability Description:</h2>

<p>The vulnerabilities in Hospital Management System 1.0 involve Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Account Takeover due to insufficient validation of user input and access privileges. IDOR allows attackers to manipulate user identifiers, granting unauthorized access to and modification of other users’ information. This oversight also facilitates Account Takeover, enabling attackers to modify sensitive user data and potentially hijack legitimate accounts for malicious activities.</p>
