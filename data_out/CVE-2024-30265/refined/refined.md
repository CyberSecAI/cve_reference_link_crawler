{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `static_path` was hardcoded to `/` instead of using the value from the command line argument, leading to `tornado.web.StaticFileHandler` being initialized with the root directory as `/`. Consequently, any file on the server's filesystem, accessible to the user running the Voila server, could be downloaded.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with network access to the server could download any file on the server's filesystem that the user running the Voila server has access to. This could potentially expose sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests to the `/static/` path, by providing the path to the file to be accessed after `/static/`.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires network access to the Voila server."
