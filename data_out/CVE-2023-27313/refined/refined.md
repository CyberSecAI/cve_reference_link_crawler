Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated in this document, but it indicates that there is a vulnerability within the SnapCenter software that allows an authenticated, unprivileged user to escalate their privileges to that of an admin user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege Escalation: The primary weakness is the ability of an unprivileged user to gain admin access. This suggests a flaw in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of SnapCenter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain administrative privileges within the SnapCenter environment. This could lead to complete control over the affected SnapCenter system and potentially impact connected systems or data managed by SnapCenter.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is network-accessible (AV:N) according to the CVSS vector, implying it could be exploited remotely if SnapCenter is accessible over a network.
- Authentication Required: The attack requires an authenticated user (PR:L), meaning the attacker needs valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction: The CVSS vector indicates that no user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: An attacker needs to have valid credentials for a SnapCenter user, even a non-admin one.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the SnapCenter server.

**Additional Notes:**
- Affected Versions: SnapCenter versions 3.x and 4.x prior to 4.9 are affected.
- Fix: The vulnerability is fixed in SnapCenter version 4.9 and later.
- The vulnerability was discovered internally by NetApp through a security audit.
- The CVSS score of 8.3 indicates a high severity vulnerability.
