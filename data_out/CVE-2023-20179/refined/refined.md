- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied data in element fields within the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTML injection vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML content, modify pages within the web interface, and potentially conduct further browser-based attacks against users of the application.
- **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker, authenticated to the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, submits malicious content within requests. The attack requires a user to view a page with the injected content to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager and able to submit crafted requests. The attacker also needs to persuade a user to view the page containing the injected content.
