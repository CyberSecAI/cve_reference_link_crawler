Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromWizardHandle` function of the Tenda FH1202 firmware. The function uses `decodePwd()` which copies user-controlled input `PPW` into a fixed-size buffer (`decode_pwd`) without proper bounds checking.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack buffer overflow exists due to insufficient input validation and lack of bounds checking when handling the `PPW` parameter.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite the stack by supplying a long `PPW` string, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited correctly.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP POST requests to the `/goform/WizardHandle` endpoint. The attacker needs to set the `WANS` parameter to "0", `WANT` to "2", and provide a long string in `PPW`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the router's `/goform/WizardHandle` endpoint.
    *   No authentication is mentioned in the document, therefore the vulnerability is possibly unauthenticated.
