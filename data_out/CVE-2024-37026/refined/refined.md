The provided content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GuC (Graphics micro-controller) context scheduling queue has a limited depth of 2 entries. When the migration exec queue shares engines with user jobs, a migration job can get stuck behind a faulting user job. This occurs because the migrate exec queue is needed to service page faults, but if it's blocked, it can lead to a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Resource contention:** The migration execution queue shares resources (BCS engines) with user-level jobs.
- **Limited queue depth:** The GuC context scheduling queue's shallow depth of 2 exacerbates the contention issue.
- **Dependency on migration for fault handling:** The migration exec queue is required to service page faults.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Deadlock:** A deadlock can occur when a migration job gets stuck behind a faulting job, preventing the system from servicing page faults and thus halting progress.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of events involving user-level jobs causing page faults and migration jobs attempting to execute. It does not appear to be directly exploitable by an attacker, but occurs because of the way the system is designed.
- It's more of a design flaw than a directly exploitable vulnerability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by normal user space activity. No special privileges or capabilities are needed to trigger this deadlock.
