Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks when displaying content within tracker report renderers and chart widgets in Tuleap. Specifically, the application did not verify if a user had the necessary permissions to access the underlying tracker data before rendering the report or chart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to verify user permissions before displaying tracker report data. This allows unauthorized users to access information they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve the names of trackers they are not authorized to access, as well as the names of fields used in those trackers' reports. This information could potentially reveal sensitive business logic or data structures, which would help an attacker to gain further access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Widget Manipulation:** The attack involves adding a tracker report renderer widget to a personal dashboard and using the ID of a renderer from a tracker that the user does not have access to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker only needs to have low privileges on the system. This means they need to have an account on the Tuleap system and the ability to create personal dashboards.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attack is performed by the attacker viewing a dashboard that they created.

**Technical Details:**
The fix involves changes to two files:
* `plugins/graphontrackersv5/include/data-access/GraphOnTrackersV5_ChartFactory.class.php`:
    - Added a check to ensure the user has the rights to view the report before displaying the chart.
* `plugins/tracker/include/Tracker/Widget/Tracker_Widget_Renderer.class.php`:
   - Added check to ensure user has access to tracker before rendering widget.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a moderate severity.
* The vulnerability is associated with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).
* Patched versions are:
    *   Tuleap Community Edition 13.7.99.239
    *   Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.6-5
    *   Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.7-4
