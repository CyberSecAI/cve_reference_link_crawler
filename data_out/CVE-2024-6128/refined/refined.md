{
  "Business Logic Flaw": {
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly validate the quantity of items added to the cart, allowing negative values.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Business Logic Flaw",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Users can manipulate the cart to have negative totals. Although the application has a check to prevent ordering under $10, the manipulated cart with negative values may cause unexpected behaviours. It can also impact the accounting/financial part of the business.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Manipulating the HTTP POST request to the `/cart/add` endpoint by providing a negative value for the 'amount' parameter."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests sent to the application."
  },
 "Username Enumeration": {
    "Root cause": "The application returns different responses based on whether the username exists or not, even with an incorrect password.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Username Enumeration",
       "Information Disclosure"
    ],
     "Impact": "An attacker can enumerate valid usernames on the login page, which simplifies brute force password attacks or social engineering attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Sending login requests with valid and invalid usernames and observing the different server responses ( 'P' for a valid username and 'E' for an invalid one)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the login endpoint and observe the response."
