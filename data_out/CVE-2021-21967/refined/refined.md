- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` with a non-null-terminated string when handling OTA updates. Specifically, the `dest` field of the `OTAUpdateStruct` can be overflowed when parsing a crafted MQTT message, causing the subsequent `strcpy` in `SeaConnectOTADownload_file` to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-120)
    - Use of `strcpy` with potentially non-null-terminated string
    - Insufficient bounds checking on input data
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of service. The buffer overflow overwrites the return address on the stack causing a crash of the device.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A specially crafted MQTT message targeting the OTA update functionality.
    - Man-in-the-middle attack can be performed to trigger this vulnerability by intercepting and modifying MQTT messages between the device and the cloud service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to intercept and modify MQTT messages.
    - Knowledge of the device's MQTT communication protocol and message structure.
    - No authentication is mentioned therefore no specific credentials are required.
