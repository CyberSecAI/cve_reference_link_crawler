- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect UDP forwarding programming when using SNMP with management plane protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way UDP forwarding is handled, allowing an attacker to bypass configured management plane protection policies.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can bypass configured management plane protection policies and access the Simple Network Management Plane (SNMP) server of an affected device. This allows the attacker to communicate with the device on the configured SNMP ports. While the attacker can send UDP datagrams to the SNMP port, only an authenticated user can retrieve or modify data using SNMP requests.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by attempting to perform an SNMP operation using broadcast as the destination address, which could be processed by an affected device with SNMP server enabled and management plane protection configured.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be adjacent to the affected device. They do not need to be authenticated.
