Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `set_thumbnail` and `delete_thumbnail` functions within the Quick Featured Images WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary privileges to modify the featured image (thumbnail) of a post.
- The `set_thumbnail` and `delete_thumbnail` functions lack proper capability checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can arbitrarily:
  - **Delete thumbnails** from posts, even those they did not author.
  - **Add thumbnails** to posts they did not author.
- This could lead to:
  - **Data manipulation:** Modification of post appearance by changing featured images.
  - **Potential Defacement:** Replacing legitimate thumbnails with inappropriate or malicious content.
  - **Website integrity compromise:** Users could lose confidence in the website's content and visual presentation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via WordPress's admin interface.
- **Specific function calls:** Exploitation requires invoking the vulnerable `set_thumbnail` and `delete_thumbnail` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an account with at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This is a low privilege account within the WordPress user roles and is not a high level admin role.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs access to the website's admin interface.
- **Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable plugin and its exploitable functions.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects Quick Featured Images plugin versions up to and including 13.7.0.
- The fix is available in version 13.7.1.
- The fix involves adding a capability check that verifies if the user has the `edit_published_posts` capability before allowing thumbnail modification. This was done by adding  `! user_can( get_current_user_id(), 'edit_published_posts')` to the existing nonce check.
- The vulnerability was reported by Wordfence.
