## Critical Security fixes for Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows (CVE-2023-41266, CVE-2023-41265)

Last Update:

May 15, 2024 3:25:44 AM

Updated By:

[Sonja\_Bauernfeind](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/28597)

Created date:

### **Executive Summary**

Two security issues in Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows have been identified and patches made available. If the two vulnerabilities are combined and successfully exploited, these issues could lead to a compromise of the server running the Qlik Sense software, including unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE).

These issues were identified and responsibly reported to Qlik by Adam Crosser and Thomas Hendrickson of [Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com/).

Qlik has received reports that this vulnerability may be being used by malicious actors. Customers should confirm they have applied the necessary patches outlined in this bulletin. If there are additional questions, customers may log a case with [Qlik Support.](https://community.qlik.com/t5/Support/ct-p/qlikSupport)

### **Affected Software**

All versions of Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows **prior** to and including these releases are impacted:

* May 2023 Patch 3
* February 2023 Patch 7
* November 2022 Patch 10
* August 2022 Patch 12

### **Severity Rating**

Using the CVSS V3.1 scoring system (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss>), Qlik rates one as high severity and one as critical.

### **Vulnerability Details**

**CVE-2023-41266** (QB-21220) Path traversal in Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows

**Severity:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N **(8.2 High)**

Due to improper validation of user supplied input, it is possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to generate an anonymous session which allows them to perform HTTP requests to unauthorized endpoints.

**CVE-2023-41265** (QB-21222) HTTP Tunneling vulnerability in Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows

**Severity:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N **(9.6 Critical)**

Due to improper validation of HTTP Headers a remote attacker is able to elevate their privilege by tunnelling HTTP requests, allowing them to execute HTTP requests on the backend server hosting the repository application.

### **Resolution**

#### **Recommendation**

> These recommendations apply at the time of writing (August 2023). For up to date information, please refer to the [Qlik Security Notice](https://community.qlik.com/t5/Labels-page/bd-p/Category_Labels?categoryId=qlik-support-updates-blog&corenode=boards&labelText=Security+Notice&nodetype=boards) and review the latest [Release Notes](https://community.qlik.com/t5/Release-Notes/tkb-p/ReleaseNotes) for your Qlik Sense version. Always update to the *most recent* patch.

Customers should upgrade Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows to a version containing fixes for these issues. Fixes are available for the following versions:

* August 2023 Initial Release
* May 2023 Patch 4
* February 2023 Patch 8
* November 2022 Patch 11
* August 2022 Patch 13
