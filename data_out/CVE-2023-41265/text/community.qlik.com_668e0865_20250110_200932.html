  The following release notes cover the versions of SAP NetWeaver, released in v8.1.0.. For questions or comments, post in the [Product Forums](https://community.qlik.com/t5/forums/postpage/choose-node/true/interaction-style/forum) or contact [Qlik Support](https://community.qlik.com/t5/support/ct-p/qlikSupport?launchChat=1).

  ### What's new in Qlik Connector for use with SAP NetWeaver v8.1.0

  #### General

  Potential BREAKING CHANGE:
  The **BEx Connector** and the **InfoProvider Connector** have been removed. The **BW Connector** is fully compatible and should be used instead.

  The SAP Connectors have been updated with general bug fixes and improvements, specifically error handling has been improved when some SAP objects raise uncaught errors.

  #### BAPI Connector

  + Update of .Net Framework to version 4.8.1
  #### BW Connector

  + Improved BEX\_LEGACY datatype processing
  + Support for navigational attributes in the filter section
  + Updated descriptions of connection properties
  + Support for alternate condition field name for ADSO
  + Reduced memory usage of metadata objects
  + Updated .Net Framework to v4.8.1
  #### Extractor Connector

  + Updated .Net Framework to v4.8.1
  + One new script property: IGNORESYSID, which will send NULL as sysId when starting an Extractor job. Default is FALSE, to send the sysId. The property should be used only if a job gets an unknown timeout error or the following error message:
    "Unknown error in Receiver Loop: No transaction handler is installed. Unable to process tRFC/qRFC requests."
    Put the property in the script section next to e.g. UPDMODE or TFRMETHOD.
    Example:
    IGNORESYSID T // (T=true)
  #### SQL Connector

  + Updated .Net Framework to v4.8.1
  + Reduced memory usage of metadata objects
  ### Resolved Defects

  #### General

  Improved handling of ADSO errors that resulted in infinite loops when errors were raised (8.1.0)

  Enhanced logging added to the SAP BW connector to improve information about authorization errors related to specific BW composite objects (8.0.3).

  Resolved issue with some conversion routines not being carried out during the extraction jobs for some fields, resulting in incorrect formatting of data. This was updated in both SQL and BW connectors (8.0.3).

  In SAP BW InfoProvider support for INT8 data types has been added (8.0.3).

  #### BW Connector

  ##### General

  + Improved error handling when an info provider returns no data due to an error
  + SncSso always disabled when using SNC
  + Removed help link from connect dialog in hub.
  + Fixed sorting order for InfoProvider fields when fetching data
  + Removed compounding infoobject prefix master data object
  ##### Script parsing fixes

  + Support slash ‘/‘ in BEx query names
  + Support '+' char in BEx variable values
  + Support dash ‘-‘ in InfoProvider condition values and be less strict in condition values requiring quoting ‘”’
  + Allow ‘@‘ character in BEx query and from names
  + Allow '&' char in BEx query variables
  + Support '.' dot characters in BEx variable values
  + Allow spaces for variable values in BEx queries
  #### Extractor Connector

  + In some cases, the SAP system couldn't find the transaction handler and there was a timeout as no packages were sent to the Qlik SAP Network Server Service
  #### SQL Connector

  + SncSso always disabled  when using SNC
  + Fix bcd/packed number datatype handling, Convert to double in connector so regional settings doesn't impact how it's converted
  + Removed help link from connect dialog in hub.
  + DEC types included also when FLTP\_LEGACY switch is enabled. The switch changes data type mapping to send data as texts instead of parsed doubles.
  ### Upgrade notes

  See the online help on [Installing the connectors](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/connectors/Subsystems/SAP_Connectors_Help/Content/Connectors_SAP/Installation/Connector-installation.htm), and the attached Installation Guide.

  ## What's new

  Learn about new features and improvements in [Qlik Compose](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/compose/December2024/Content/ComposeDWDL/Compose_Release_Notes/newfeatures.htm "What's new in Qlik Compose December 2024").

  ## Migration and upgrade

  This section describes the supported upgrade and migration paths.

  ### Upgrade paths

  Direct upgrade is supported from Compose November 2023 (and its service releases) only. Customers wishing to upgrade from earlier Compose versions should first upgrade to Compose November 2023 and then to Compose December 2024.

  ### Licensing

  Existing Compose for Data Warehouses customers who want to create and manage Data Warehouse projects only in Qlik Compose can use their existing license. Similarly, existing Compose for Data Lakes customers who want to create and manage Data Lake projects only in Qlik Compose can use their existing license.

  Customers migrating from Qlik Compose for Data Warehouses or Qlik Compose for Data Lakes, and who want to create and manage both Data Warehouse projects and Data Lakes projects in Qlik Compose, will need to obtain a new license. Customers upgrading from Compose February 2021 can continue using their existing license.

  It should be noted that the license is enforced only when trying to generate, run, or schedule a task (via the UI or API ). Other operations such as Test Connection may also fail if you do not have an appropriate license.

  ### Migrating from Compose for Data Lakes

  Compose for Data Lakes has been superseded by Qlik Compose. Existing Compose for Data Lakes customers can migrate their projects from Qlik Compose for Data Lakes to Qlik Compose. You can migrate both your project definitions and your data although the latter is only required if you need to migrate production data.

  For migration instructions, see the Qlik Compose August 2021 Release notes.

  **Note:** Migration can be performed from Compose for Data Lakes 6.6 only.

  ### Compatibility with related Qlik products

  Qlik Replicate is required for landing data into the data warehouse or storage while Qlik Enterprise Manager allows you to monitor and control Compose tasks running on different servers. This section lists the supported versions for each of these products.

  Compose December 2024 is compatible with the following Replicate and Enterprise Manager versions:

  + **Qlik Replicate** - Qlik Replicate November 2024, Qlik Replicate May 2024, Qlik Replicate November 2023, and Qlik Replicate May 2023 latest service release.
  + **Enterprise Manager** - Qlik Enterprise Manager November 2024, Qlik Enterprise Manager May 2024, and Qlik Enterprise Manager November 2023.

  ## End of Life/Support and deprecated features

  The following versions are no longer supported:

  + Databricks 9.1 LTS

  ### What's New

  Learn about new features and improvements in [Qlik Cloud](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Introduction/saas-change-log.htm).

  ### Resolved Defects

  The following Release Notes cover resolved defects for Qlik Cloud. Solved issues and limitations for Qlik Cloud Services are also listed.

  | QB-27392 | Visualizations: Reports are missing objects when custom theme is using custom font. | Resolved an issue where loading of the custom fonts in a theme was not properly awaited before reports were performed. After properly awaiting the font, loading reports are not missing objects anymore. |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | QB-27336 | Qlik Cloud Administration: Navigation bar not clickable on Tenant encryption page | Resolved an issue where the navigation bar was not clickable on the Tenant encryption page. |
  | QB-29673 | Qlik Cloud Hub: Filtering in 'Favorites' does not work | Fixed an issue where filtering items under the 'Favorites' section of the Qlik Cloud hub did not work, resulting in all items being displayed. |
  | QB-28915 | Qlik Cloud: Objects missing when exporting a story as PDF | Resolved an issue where exporting stories and sheets would fail due to improper reuse of session objects. |
  | QB-28939 | Qlik Cloud: Japanese Kanji not rendered in exported PDF | Japanese Kanji were incorrectly rendered in exported PDFs, affecting titles and text content, despite the app being configured correctly with the "ja-JP" collation locale. This issue has been fixed. |
  | QB-27327 | Qlik Cloud: Inadequate contrast in DLE load Log | Updated the Data Load Editor (DLE) load log by changing the light grey color to a darker grey to enhance accessibility and meet contrast requirements for better readability. |
  | QB-29359 | Qlik Cloud Search: Unable to open apps and links from 'Search results' | Fixed an issue where clicking on a link to an app or a link from global 'Search results' would either fail to open the app or open an empty link. |
  | QB-29065 | Qlik Cloud: Race condition issue in reloads service | Resolved a rare race condition issue in the reloads service that caused reloads to exit abruptly at the start. The fix ensures that the service now waits for session requests to return before initiating the reloads. |
  | QB-28513 | AutoML: Incorrect routing key for OOM errors | Resolved an issue where the routing key for Out of Memory (OOM) errors was incorrectly set to "prediction.requested.error." This has been corrected to "prediction.error," allowing for accurate tracking of returnCode -9 and proper classification of OOM errors. |
  | QB-27431 | Qlik Cloud Hub: Combo chart appears blank when monitored from the hub | Fixed an issue where combo charts did not appear when monitored from the Qlik Cloud hub. |
  | QB-27523 | Qlik Cloud Administration: External consumption of analyzer capacity not shown | Analyzer capacity consumed by other deployments and regions has been added to the displayed measurement in the Administration activity center. |
  | QB-27802 | Qlik Cloud: Client crash when dragging fields in simplified authoring mode | Fixed a rare client crash that displayed the message "An error occurred" when dragging a field in simplified authoring mode, specifically when the sheet contained a master "Date picker" object. |
  | QB-27298 | Qlik Cloud: DLE and script editor failing when accessing script history for some users | Fixed an issue where the data load editor (DLE) and script editor would fail for some users when accessing script history. This occurred because the script history was using an incorrect locale for date/time formatting. If no default locale was set for the user, it was registered as null, causing the UI to fail. |
  | QB-28408 | Visualizations: Waterfall chart behaves differently when inside a layout container | Fixed a problem that caused the layout container to incorrectly handle ongoing selections when the show condition changed from true to false. This has been fixed and the behavior is now aligned with the tabbed container. |
  | QB-29194 | Qlik Cloud: Unable to edit subscriptions | Resolved an issue where the Edit subscription dialog did not appear when attempting to edit a sheet subscription. |
  | QB-29401 | Visualizations: Problem replacing invalid dimensions / measures master items | Fixed a problem where replacing dimensions or measures would sometimes fail if they were linked to a non-existing master dimension. |
  | QB-27227 | Bar chart label incorrect when the result is 1.95 | Fixed floating error on formatting. |
  | QB-29505 | Qlik Cloud: User assigned Tenant Admin role does not see their user when assigning space roles | Resolved an issue where a user assigned Tenant Admin role via group membership would not find their specific user name (ID) when attempting to assign space roles. |
  | QB-29009 | Visualizations: Problems with sheet navigation | Fixed a problem that intermittently prevented opening apps, adding new sheets, and navigating existing sheets. This was solved by optimizing the reranking of sheets whenever there are rank conflicts. |
  | QB-28822 | Qlik Engine: Selections discarded when distributing QlikView files to the Cloud | Fixed a problem that caused QlikView objects to be incorrectly distributed if the resource type was wrong. A new access rule solves this issue and includes the objects in the app. |
  | QB-29763 | Qlik Cloud Hub: 'Monitoring chart' removed from collections after app reload | Resolved an issue where the 'Monitoring chart' would lose its association with collections it was added to (including 'Favorites') when an app it originated from was reloaded. |
  | QB-28372 | Qlik Engine: Intermittent cancellation of store/upload | Fixed a degradation that caused intermittent cancellations of data file store/upload during reload. |
  | QB-29761 | Qlik Cloud: Inaccurate 'Time zone' displayed for new users | For new QCS users who don’t have the 'preferredZoneinfo' property defined, the 'Time zone' value displayed in the hub's 'Profile' settings would incorrectly show a preset value, which was actually inherited from the browser. This could create inconsistency between UI and other services which in the absence of 'preferredZoneinfo' default to UTC time zone. The fix was to display blank value when not set. |
  | QB-29608 | Qlik Cloud: Replacing dimensions or measures fails in charts with modifiers | Resolved an issue where replacing dimensions or measures would sometimes fail if they were linked to a non-existing master dimension in charts using modifiers. This fix complements the solution provided for QB-29401, which addressed the issue for charts not using modifiers. |
  | QB-29610 | Qlik Engine: New optional parameter Hint for XIRR Aggregation function | When a Hint argument is provided, XIRR will pick the numerically closest valid answer it can find, which can be either a positive or a negative one. If no hint value is provided, it will always pick a positive solution before a negative one. |
  | QB-28340 | Qlik Cloud: Migration failure due to decryption issues with bookmarks | Fixed an issue where the key migration process failed when encountering corrupted bookmarks or other decryption errors. The engine has been updated to ensure that keys are migrated even when bookmarks cannot be read. |
  | QB-29791 | Qlik Data Prep: Error when updating data files in Data Load Editor | Fixed an encoding problem that caused the confirmation dialog to not appear when replacing files in Data manager. This happened when file names included special characters. In the Data load editor and Script editor, an error was displayed when attempting to replace files, sometimes without special characters in file names. These issues were resolved by ensuring file names are encoded only once. |
  | QB-27983 | Restrict send to excel option in contextual menu for "Has restricted View" | Users or groups with "Has restricted View" permission now have Send to excel option in contextual menu. |
  | QB-27718 | Qlik Cloud: Ascending and descending sorting not working in straight tables | Resolved an issue where the ascending and descending sort options for straight tables were not functioning correctly. Sorting has now been fixed to work as intended. |
  | QB-29043 | Qlik Engine: Distinct count on key fields incorrectly handling key subsets in reports | In reporting mode, a set expression with a distinct count over a key field was not always calculated correctly. The calculation outcome depended on the table load order and the subset relation of the key in the tables. The reporting calculation now builds an invariant and well-determined field and table state. |

  + Modifiers: turn your measure into an accumulation, a moving average, a difference, or a relative number with a single drop down.

  **Chart exploration for straight tables embedded in layout and tab containers**

  Chart exploration in the new straight table is now supported in layout container and the new tab container.

  **Combo chart improvements**

  + Added labels to markers and a setting to toggle the grid.
  + Option to display labels on stacked measure segments.
  + Chart animations

  **Chart background image by URL**

  Chart background by URL offers huge potential to style and build up a highly dynamic and stylish app. Useful for:

  + Linking images from external sources.
  + Building up dynamic images using an expression with inline SVG as a Data URI.
  + Fetching images from the media library with an expression and the API.

  **General styling of bundled charts**

  The remaining charts in the visualization and the dashboard bundle are getting general styling including font styling of titles, background color and image options and border and shadow settings.

  #### **Data & Platform**

  **Enable and disable autocomplete in script and expression editors**

  Users can now enable or disable autocomplete hints when writing Qlik script in the script editor, data load editor, and expression editor.

  **Expressions in field labels**

  You can now have expressions in field labels for drill-down and cyclic dimensions. This lets you for example enable translation of labels in multi-language apps.

  Qlik now enables all customers to distribute Qlik Sense apps to a Qlik Cloud tenant, regardless of their license. This update particularly benefits clients on a QAP (Qlik Analytics Platform) license, who can now distribute apps to the cloud—a capability that was previously unavailable to them.

  **CSRF protection extended to Websockets and add-ons**

  Extended CSRF protection to Websocket requests and added support for CSRF to add-on products.

  If you are using mashups or have cross-site domain setups, add the following response headers to enhance security and control access. These headers help protect against Cross-Site Forgery (CSRF) attacks:

  + Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080/)
  + Access-Control- Allow-Credentials: true
  + Access-Control-Expose-Headers: qlik-csrf-token

  **Postgres database support**

  Added support for Postgres versions 15 and 16.

  ### Resolved Defects

  #### **November 2024 Patch 2**

  | Key | Title | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | QB-29911 | Qlik Sense: Engine times out when calculating dimensions in large applications | When trying to allocate large chunks of the local heap (between 1.2 GB and 2.4 GB) a bug would cause an infinite loop that could hang the engine process. The bug has been fixed. |
  | QB-30110 | Qlik Cloud Services: Fuzzy search using Latin characters returns Chinese characters first | Searching a term in a file using Latin characters would return terms with Chinese characters first in the results, even though they don't match. This was due to non-ascii characters, such as Chinese, not being supported for fuzzy search. The bug has been fixed and searches should now return the expected results. |
  | QB-29868 | Visualizations: Adding access to clear all and delete buttons via keyboard | We have added the ability to navigate to the clear all and delete buttons using the keyboard, and announcing what they do through the screen reader. |

  #### **November 2024 Patch 1**

  **Multi-Language Support Available in Insight Advisor Chat**
  A drop-down button has been added that allows users in Insight Advisor Chat to change the language used when having natural language interactions. Supported Languages are [here](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Insights/insight-advisor-create-visualizations.htm#anchor-8).

  #### **November 2024**

  | **Key** | **Title** | **Description** |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | QB-29903 | "Not found" error on file preview and reload for some SFTP connections. | Depending on SFTP server, some valid connections returned the "not found" error on selecting file on preview or file reloading. This degrade is now fixed. |
  | QB-29610 | Qlik Engine: New optional parameter Hint for XIRR Aggregation function | When a Hint argument is provided, XIRR will pick the numerically closest valid answer it can find, which can be either a positive or a negative one. If no hint value is provided, it will always pick a positive solution before a negative one. |
  | QB-29492 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Variance Waterfall fails to export as PDF or image | Fixed a problem introduced with the February 2024 release which prevented the exporting Variance waterfall to PDF or image. |
  | QB-29401 | Visualizations: Problem replacing invalid dimensions / measures master items | Fixed a problem where replacing dimensions or measures would sometimes fail if they were linked to a non-existing master dimension. |
  | QB-29232 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: The 'More' menu in the filter pane displayed incorrectly | The 'More' menu in filter panes displayed incorrectly under other objects or the assets panel. |
  | QB-29043 | Qlik Engine: Distinct count on key fields incorrectly handling key subsets in reports | In reporting mode, a set expression with a distinct count over a key field was not always calculated correctly. The calculation outcome depended on the table load order and the subset relation of the key in the tables. The reporting calculation now builds an invariant and well-determined field and table state. |
  | QB-29033 | Qlik Sense Platform: WebSocket connection lost | Fixed a problem that would, in some cases, throw an exception that caused the loop WebSocket listener to terminate. |
  | QB-29018 | Qlik Sense Engine: Incorrect library function used for deleting an element from object array | While updating the properties cache for DeleteChild operation, the library function used to remove an element from the childlist object array causes the last element to be moved to the deleted element index. This causes the original order of remaining elements to be changed. Fix is added to use the library function which preserves the order of remaining elements. |
  | QB-29009 | Visualizations: Problems with sheet navigation | Fixed a problem that intermittently prevented opening apps, adding new sheets, and navigating existing sheets. This was solved by optimizing the reranking of sheets whenever there are rank conflicts. |
  | QB-28873 | Qlik License: Captcha box not always visible on the the Signed License Definition | Fixed a problem where the Captcha box was not always visible on the Signed License Definition site. |
  | QB-28865 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Cannot set or unset bookmark as default | Fixed a problem that prevented the setting or unsetting of the default bookmark within an app. |
  | QB-28864 | Qlik Engine: Window script function converts Nulls to text | Fixed a problem where the window function would incorrectly translate loaded null fields to '-' which could then be selected. With this fix, the handling of null values is corrected and null fields remain null. |
  | QB-28741 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: The listbox 'More' menu for tables and pivot tables closed without changes | When selecting one of the options in the listbox 'More' menu, it closed without applying the changes. The selections are now applied correctly instead of closing the menu. |
  | QB-28727 | Visualizations: Not possible to search for bookmark | Now validating bookmark creation date before the formatting date. |
  | QB-28658 | Visualizations: Sheet styles not working for newly created apps | Fixed a problem where sheet styles did not persist on new apps. Properties are now bound to the visual elements which show the changes. |
  | QB-28630 | Visualizations: Incorrect position of data points on a line chart | Fixed a problem that caused data points to be incorrectly positioned on small screens or when zooming to 125%. |
  | QB-28611 | Qlik Engine: Lineage data API is not working when using Preceding LOAD | Fixed a problem where the /v1/apps/{appId}/data/lineage API returned an empty discriminator for Load From statements with a preceding load. |
  | QB-28589 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Field titles missing in Chart Exploration | Alternative columns were initially shown without proper titles in the new Qlik Sense straight table's chart exploration. This happened during sheet editing and when users worked with the exploration feature to add and remove columns. |
  | QB-28453 | Qlik Sense Engine: Dynamic scripts in charts did not add or replace values in the correct rows | When evaluated in a chart, the dynamic scripts did not have access to the context information used to access the source rows. Therefore, they only used one row for all additions and replacements. |
  | QB-28451 | Qlik Sense Engine: Dynamic scripts were not evaluated when expected | The engine only checked if a chart contained expressions when determining if it should be evaluated as a table or a hypercube. This meant that any hypercube modifiers such as dynamic scripts were ignored if the chart did not contain an expression. |
  | QB-28426 | Qlik Enterprise Connectors: Amazon Redshift populating duplicate columns | This enhancement addresses an issue where duplicate columns were being fetched when schemas with the same name existed in both the external schema and the Datashare schema. Now, columns are retrieved only from the selected database schema, ensuring accurate data retrieval and eliminating duplicate columns. |
  | QB-28406 | Qlik Sense: Axios security issue | Fixed a security issue caused by Qlik Sense using an old version of Axios. The was resolved by updating the version of Axios used by Qlik Sense. |
  | QB-28395 | Qlik Sense: Tooltips do not display for selected dimensions | Fixed a problem that prevented the display of tooltips for selected dimensions in Associative insights. This was due to a missing attribute which has now been restored. |
  | QB-28392 | Qlik Enterprise Connectors: Google Big Query Connector - Select dialog | Changing the catalog from dropdown did not refresh the list of databases. |
  | QB-28299 | Qlik Sense Engine: The Concat function resulted in a faulty lineage | In some cases, when the Concat function was used in combination with the FROM load statement, the Concat function did not add the correct sources for a field, resulting in an faulty lineage graph. The faulty graph assumed that the sources were present and therefore incremented an internal index, which resulted in incorrect relations between nodes. Support for the Concat function has been added for lineage and it will now properly add the sources. |
  | QB-28201 | Qlik Engine: Iterator is shown as a non-integer when using large values | Fixed a problem with the string conversion method used in a FOR loop, which caused formatting issues when handling large values. |
  | QB-28142 | Qlik Sense Engine: Missing privileges for connections | Fixed a problem where connections that were fetched using REST API were missing privileges. This would cause the Add data button to be missing from the connection Attached Files. |
  | QB-27988 | Qlik Engine: Syntax error on tab during script execution | Fixed a LOAD script parsing problem when the WHERE clause contains "(". |
  | QB-27933 | Qlik Sense: Date picker library is outdated | Updated momentJS to the latest version. |
  | QB-27902 | Qlik Sense Engine: Hypercube modifier REPLACE LOAD sourced data incorrectly and added rows to chart | When REPLACE LOAD was used in a dynamic chart script, it was using only one row for the source data regardless of the actual number of source rows. It also incorrectly added rows to the chart. |
  | QB-27821 | Resolved UI issue: Restored internal menu functionality in Dev Hub | In the Mashup editor in Dev Hub, the 'Menu' button in the toolbar was inadvertently replaced with a 'Help' button. The issue is resolved and access to the 'Menu' button has been restored. |
  | QB-27754 | Qlik Sense: CORS error blocks external API requests | Fixed an issue with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests that were blocked when making external API requests. The issue was related to the handling of the "withCredentials" option in the requests. |
  | QB-27751 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Overflow on button labels was not displaying correctly with ellipses | The button labels were missing settings for text overflow. CSS settings were added and now the labels work as expected. |
  | QB-27657 | Qlik Sense Engine: Parquet file not deleted | Parquet files were in some cases not deleted after being used. This has been fixed by not using the MemoryMap option when opening Parquet files for reading when the files have been downloaded using a web connector. |
  | QB-27639 | Schedule reload task using custom schedule | When adding a custom filter, some valid format options produced an error. |
  | QB-27632 | Qlik Sense Engine: Incorrect format when exporting a table containing dates | When exporting a table containing dates to Microsoft Excel, the date fields were exported in numeric format, instead of formatted date/time. This has been fixed by treating unformatted date/time values as formatted Excel date/time fields, using default formats that adjust to the viewer's locale. |
  | QB-27623 | "Show totals above" option is missing when converting native Pivot table to Pivot table (Visualization bundle) | An issue was identified in which the "Show totals above" option" is not shown when converting a native Pivot table to the Pivot table from the Visualization bundle. The issue has been resolved by adjusting a setting for indent mode. |
  | QB-27565 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Added sanity check for invalid column width values, preventing view data crashing | Possibly due to converting a table to a pivot table, the, the values stored in the pivot table properties for column widths were incorrect. When the view data mode was selected, those incorrect values caused the chart to crash. A sanity check has been added to prevent the crash. |
  | QB-27477 | Qlik Engine: Tables with the same expression show different results | Fixed a problem when SET analysis constraints did not correctly limit the number of rows in the hypercube, leading to inconsistent results for the same expression. |
  | QB-27393 | Visualizations: Filter pane selection options are not displayed | Fixed a problem where expanding a filter pane caused the buttons for making different selection options (such as more, clear selection, cancel, and confirm)  were not displayed. |
  | QB-27352 | Qlik sense Visualizations: Selection popup and bar is blank when using getGlobal method in a mashup | Fixed a problem where listboxes within mashups could stop working. This problem occurred specifically for mashups created using the Capability API and calling the qlik.getGlobal function. |
  | QB-27348 | Qlik Enterprise Connectors: Invalid Session Token error for Amazon Athena connections | Resolved an issue with the Amazon Athena connector when using a proxy with user name and password to authenticate the connection. The resolution involved fixing the authentication process so that the Proxy Username value entered by the user is properly forwarded to the driver. |
  | QB-27277 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Data Manager custom association field preview not working | Fixed a problem that caused the preview of the custom association fields to stop working when selecting which fields to associate the tables with. |
  | QB-27237 | Qlik Sense: Custom Trigger with double digits causes custom filter validation error | Custom filter now allows the use of double digits for the hourly position for Tasks in the Qlik Management Console. |
  | QB-27227 | Bar chart label incorrect when the result is 1.95 | Fixed floating error on formatting. |
  | QB-27147 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Qlik Sense icon not showing in apps on May 2024 IR | Fixed a problem that caused the favicon to disappear on some apps. |
  | QB-27108 | Visualizations: Exporting object with styling fails | Fixed a problem where exporting any object with shadow values as an image would fail. This was solved by disabling chart shadows on server printing. |
  | QB-27008 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: "Color by expression"  not working in a dimensionless barchart | Fixed an issue where you could not switch to "Color by expression" in a dimensionless barchart and instead it defaulted to single color. |
  | QB-27006 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Incorrect CSS for overflowing content | When the content of a multi KPI could not fit in the height of the object, the data could end up inaccessible to users. By correcting the CSS, the data can always scrolled to the data. |
  | QB-26965 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Incorrect rendering of heatmap | Fixed a floating error in calculating the number of rows and columns that caused heatmaps to render incorrectly. |
  | QB-26946 | Qlik Mobile zooming issue | Prevented users from interacting with a chart in a small device if the browser is zoomed in. |
  | QB-26936 | Qlik Sense Engine: Select and search methods fail to parse search strings starting with certain characters | Search strings starting with any of the following characters: <>\"~()='[] would not be parsed correctly when the user was expecting an exact search. A fix was added which will allow users to force an exact search by adding an extra backslash "\" before any of the special characters (for example, to search for "<x>" enter the search string "\<x>"). This fix is disabled by default. To enable it, update the Settings.ini file to include "EnableSpecialCharacterEscapingInSearch = 1". |
  | QB-26902 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: The button object was unclickable in a mashup if the label was too long | Buttons with long labels are now clickable within a mashup. |
  | QB-26880 | Qlik Web Connectors: Files stored in a team folder are inaccessible through the Dropbox connector | A new connection parameter was added to access Dropbox team folders and files. The root parameter allows the selection of team root if it's available for authenticated users. |
  | QB-26872 | Qlik Sense Engine: Resolving issues from open app performance enhancements | There were some issues with connection deletion behavior after implementing performance enhancements for opening apps. These have been resolved. |
  | QB-26840 | Qlik Sense Engine: The <CreatorDoc> tag is empty in QVDs created with Qlik Sense February 2024 | Fixed a problem where the <CreatorDoc> tag in the metadata of QVD files created with Qlik Sense February 2024 was empty, instead of showing the app ID that generated the QVD. <CreatorDoc> tags are now written from the STORE statement, even if the format spec is omitted. |
  | QB-26786 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Alternative measure & dimension dropdown was not updating correctly | The alternative measure & dimension dropdown did not update correctly when a user edited a chart. This issue has been fixed. |
  | QB-26669 | Qlik Sense Engine: Problem exporting straight table to Excel | Fixed a problem with handling the pre-generated format string for Euro during Excel export from the Qlik Engine. |
  | QB-26657 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Qlik extensions lost custom properties after server restart | Three extensions did not have the version specified correctly:- sn-layout-container- sh-shape- sn-text  The versions are now updated properly in all files for these extensions |
  | QB-26613 | Qlik Engine: Dimension created with Aggr function does not fully support selection | Fixed an issue that would cause some apps to have a limited ability to make selections in a dimension created using the Aggr function. |
  | QB-26558 | Qlik Engine: Connector performance reload issues in Qlik Sense February 2024 | The Select Statement Lineage for Sense Server has been disabled as it served no purpose in Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows. This was causing issues with some connectors by making irrelevant calls in Sense Server. |
  | QB-26530 | Qlik Sense: Custom Cache Control settings not maintained with server reboot | Enhanced the Hub service to use a retry mechanism, allowing it to wait for the QRS API's /ContentCacheControl endpoint to respond. |
  | QB-26504 | Qlik Cloud Engine: Line Chart not showing all values for X-axis | Fixed an issue that would, in some apps, exclude the highest magnitude dimension value from a chart using a continuous x-axis. This could happen when the data point's x-axis value was encoded using more than the 15-digit precision used in the QIX Engine |
  | QB-26486 | Qlik Sense on Windows: Straight table columns unusable with auto width | Fixed a problem where columns in straight tables using auto width became unusable. The minimum width has been increased to 120px. |
  | QB-26447 | Visualizations: Some table column headers do not wrap | Due to an indexing error in the table code, the showing/hiding header icons and wrapping header text, were based on the wrong column. These calculations now use the correct index and the text wrap and icons are shown correctly. |
  | QB-26407 | Qlik Sense: Node.js updated | Node.js has been updated to version 18.20.4. |
  | QB-26392 | Qlik Sense on Windows: Failing requests to fetch custom brand spam console | Fixed a problem where requests specific to the Qlik Cloud Services offering were made on Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows deployment causing the failing requests to spam the console. |
  | QB-26205 | Visualizations: Cannot rearrange columns in the new Straight Table | Fixed a problem where columns could not be rearranged in the new straight table if the table had conditional columns. |
  | QB-26199 | Visualizations: Undo button not working | Fixed a problem where the undo button was unresponsive after unlinking a master dimension. |
  | QB-26192 | Connection issues after access token expiration | Dependent connection parameters were not being properly passed when re-authenticating after access token expiration for several connectors, and the default values for these parameters were being used instead. This fix correctly passes in the necessary parameters. This issue affected the Azure Storage, MSCRM, OneDrive, Office365, and Outlook365 connectors. |
  | QB-26106 | Qlik Engine: HypercubeEvaluator calculation error | Fixed a problem in a hypercube calculation that returned a row even when the selection result was empty. After the fix now rows should be returned. |
  | QB-26098 | Scatter plot labels | Fixed a problem with the rendering of the scatter plot during changes in viewing data. |
  | QB-25981 | Incorrect translation: Japanese | Corrected the Japanese translation for "Sorting in search" when working with pivot tables. |
  | QB-25920 | Qlik Engine: Unable to filter text values of QVD in Data Manager | Fixed a problem where the filtering of a text field for QVD files was not working. If the field type was a string but the filter value was a number (for example: 1), the filter would not work. This has been fixed by forcing the columns to be interpreted as text. |
  | QB-25909 | Qlik Sense on Windows: Unsupported trigger time zone reported as (GMT + 0000) | This adds a fix for setting Daylight Savings Time to Permanent Standard Time if the time zone is not supported by the Qlik Management Console (QMC). |
  | QB-25871 | Qlik Engine: Cannot reference iterator value using $() in chart script | In a chart script, the iterator in a "For… Next" loop could not be used in a dollar expansion expression. This has now been fixed. |
  | QB-25773 | Visualizations: Inconsistent behavior when pressing home/end keys | Fixed a problem that caused inconsistent behavior when pressing the home/end in the search listbox of a filter pane. |
  | QB-25730 | Qlik Sense Engine: Inner set expression issue when outer set expression is present | Fixed an issue that caused the miscalculation of inner set expressions when outer set expressions were present. The inner set expression {<Field1=StateA::Field1>} will now read Field1 correctly from StateA even when an outer set expression is present. |
  | QB-25031 | Qlik Web Connectors: Unable to load data from Odata database via Qlik Odata connector | Fixed a problem where a "System.OutOfMemoryException" would be thrown if the OData connector returned a large response. This was solved by accepting smaller values in the Max depth parameter. Additionally, new tables have been added to retrieve information (V4GetSchemas, V4GetEntities, and V4GetProperties). |
  | QB-25016 | Qlik Sense: Issue with display scaling on Qlik Sense on Windows February 2024 | Fixed a problem with scaling present on high DPI monitors. |
  | QB-24997 | Qlik Sense on Windows: Exception importing sheets to NPrinting May 2023 | Fixed a problem on the main-web-container component shipped with QSEoW that caused NPrinting exports of extended Sense sheets to fail when a Sense app carded theme was used. |
  | QB-24968 | Qlik Web Connectors: Error when importing a table using the Qlik ODATA connector | Fixed a problem that caused an error ("Sequence contains no elements") when retrieving data from the JsonV4GetData table. With this fix, paces in path parameter values are now processed correctly. |
  | QB-24536 | Data Prep & Insights: Import from SharePoint fails with error message | For some connectors, the same QVD ID (file name) was generated for two table sources, resulting in an error message ("Data could not be added to Data Manager"). We have changed how the QVD ID is generated by adding a load statement and including it in the text to generate the hash. |
  | QB-23881 | Qlik Sense: User details exposed in WebSockets (CWE-200 | Fixed a vulnerability problem where user details were exposed in WebSockets (CWE-200 information exposure). This was solved by hiding the owner data for Anonymous User Context in AppPropList and the Owner data in the Hub App Card for Anonymous User Context. |
  | QB-23565 | Improved HTTP header validation | Improved HTTP communication by providing additional header validations. |

  ###

  ### Known issues and limitations

  The following issues and limitations were identified at release time. The list is not comprehensive but lists all known major issues and limitations.

  #### **Clients**

  + Third-party extensions are currently not supported on mobile devices, and the Qlik Trusted Extension Developer program does not accredit extensions for use on mobile devices. Generated items might not be visualized properly on a mobile device, depending on individual device specifications, mobile OS, and the size of the Qlik Sense app.
  + When you consume Qlik Sense apps using the Microsoft Edge browser on touch/hybrid devices, the long-press action does not work. This prevents you from accessing functions such as an object’s context menu, which requires a long press in touch mode. This is a Microsoft Edge issue.
    **Workaround:** If you use a hybrid device, turn off touch mode, and then turn it back on again.
  + Export as Anonymous does not work for mashups deployed in a domain that is different from the domain where Qlik Sense is installed. Export only works for Anonymous if the mashup is deployed in the same domain as Qlik Sense.
  + When using the new Load Extension syntax in the load script, the Data Load Editor syntax completion does not work well after the keyword “Extension” when trying to write the call to an SSE function (AAI function). The script still executes correctly.
  + Legend does not show dimension values after row number 3000.
  + Limitations when exporting a story to PowerPoint:
    - Titles are not rescaled as HTML. Font settings are not exported.
    - Storytelling effects are not applied.
    - Exported charts might show fixed scroll bars, depending on the export resolution.
  + It is not possible to open the context menu of an org chart on a touch device.
  + When you choose to view data in the context menu in a dynamic chart and make a new selection in the app, you need to refresh the browser for the chart to be displayed again.
  + **New/Updated - Android mobile devices:** Customers using Android mobile devices via the Qlik Sense mobile app need to update their QSM-CM Android app to 1.30.1 which is now on play store.
  #### **Dynamic views**

  + Dynamic views that you delete from one app are also deleted from every other app that was using the same view. There is no workaround for this issue. Avoid deleting views that might already be in use by other apps.
  + When you create a new dynamic view in the assets pane, the dropdown menu item does not automatically change to show the charts of the newly created dynamic view if there are any existing dynamic views. You must click on the dropdown menu to choose the newly created view.
  + The data for a dynamic view is automatically refreshed whenever you open a sheet that contains charts for the view. The same happens when you enter and then return from the global selections pane, and when you add a new chart for the view. Refrain from performing these actions on the base app to prevent triggering refreshes.
  + The view of a dynamic chart is cleared and shows a message indicating a view constraint violation whenever you change the selection state of the base app in a way that violates the view's constraints. Refrain from changing the selection state of the base app until it has finished making use of the data in any of the dynamic view charts.
  + The ‘Go to source’ option on a snapshot slide (available on right-click) for a dynamic chart does not select the actual dynamic chart when you change the view to the base app sheet.
  + Changes to chart settings for dynamic view charts using the Exploration menu are lost after refreshing the view.
  + Dynamic views do not support the Trellis extension.
  #### **Managing a Qlik Sense site**

  + The Edit pane under Custom properties in the Qlik Management Console (QMC) can currently handle a limited number of custom properties. If you want to edit custom property values in the QMC, we recommend keeping the number of custom property values to a maximum of 500. If you want to apply values without modifying them, the QMC can handle up to 10,000 custom property values.
  + When you remove app objects from an application via the QMC interface, deleted objects are not removed from the application’s binary file stored on the file system.
  + It is not possible to use a security rule on the HubSection\_\* resource to hide the ‘Open hub’ link from the navigation menu when accessing an app as an anonymous user.
    **Workaround:** Use reverse proxy to redirect the ‘Open hub’ link to a preferred landing site.
  + Windows service Qlik Engine cannot be started on a node where the Qlik Engine service is disabled through the QMC. Every time Windows restarts for that node, the Qlik Engine service fails to start up and throws an error in Windows event logs. You can prevent this by temporarily disabling the Qlik Engine service in Windows Service Manager.
  + Data connection passwords containing special characters (such as "=", "%", or ";") are not properly encoded when updated via the QMC. This causes authentication errors when trying to connect to specific data sources, which could cause reload tasks to fail.
    **Workaround:** Use the data load editor to update the password. Note that once the password is updated, the name of the data connection is automatically appended by "(domain\_userId)". You can adjust this later via the QMC.
  #### **Qlik Sense Desktop**

  + Qlik Sense Desktop can play WebM and Ogg but not MP4 files. This is due to limitations in Chromium.
  #### **Connectors**

  + REST connector: The ‘Next token’ pagination option does not work when the pagination token has the same value for each page.
  + For connectors in the ODBC Connector Package only the data types listed as supported in the online help have been verified to work correctly in the Preview and Script editor. However, the ODBC Connector Package does not prevent you from loading other data types. In some cases, you can load unsupported data types with the load script.
  + ODBC connector: Database connectors in the ODBC Connector Package do not work properly if the username on the Microsoft Windows system running Qlik Sense Desktop contains letters that are not English alphanumeric characters.
    **Workaround**: Change the Windows system locale to match the character set that contains the characters used in the username. For example, if the system locale on the system running Qlik Sense Desktop is set to English and a username contains Swedish characters, you must change the system locale to Swedish for the ODBC connector to work properly.
  + The Qlik Salesforce connector does not support PK chunking on sharing objects. PK chunking is only supported on parent objects.
  + The Apache Phoenix connector does not support non-Latin characters in metadata. The connector might return corrupted data or unpredictable query results if you run a query with non-Latin characters in metadata, such as table names, column names, and aliases.
  #### **Cloud deployments and Multi-Cloud**

  + When you download a pivot table in Qlik Sense Enterprise SaaS, expanded rows are not included but stay collapsed.
  ### Upgrade notes

For questions or comments, post in the [Product Forums](https://community.qlik.com/t5/forums/postpage/choose-node/true/interaction-style/forum) or contact [Qlik Support](https://community.qlik.com/t5/support/ct-p/qlikSupport?launchChat=1).

  ### What's new in Qlik DataTransfer November 2024

  The Qlik DataTransfer November 2024 release does not have any new features, but only provides an update of the embedded Qlik Engine and the fixes for the issues described below.

  ### Resolved Defects

  + Unhandled exceptions in the "Data folders" file watching mechanism have been fixed, and the underlying cause for the exception is now logged. Previously the DataUploadService component of Qlik DataTransfer crashed and lost track of any pending uploads.
  + Temporary files are now ignored. Editing of XLSX-files residing in a folder being watched by Qlik DataTransfer could occasionally cause the DataUploadService to crash when it attempted to upload the temporary files (~$\*.xlsx) created during the 3rd-party software's "Save" process.
  + Any invalid configuration settings in the services.conf file are now logged as warnings with fallback to defaults. This will help users self-service while attempting to make advanced configuration changes. Invalid settings could previously cause the Service Dispatcher to continually restart the DataUploadService, making the application unresponsive.
  ### Known issues and limitations

  This release has the same known issues and limitations as noted in [the release notes for Qlik DataTransfer November 2022](https://community.qlik.com/t5/Release-Notes/Qlik-DataTransfer-Release-Notes-November-2022-Initial-Release/ta-p/1998609#:~:text=for%20Qlik%20DataTransfer-,Known%20issues%20and%20limitations,-The%20following%20issues "Known issues and limitations November 2022").

  ### Upgrade notes

  Please refer to the online help for information about [Upgrading Qlik DataTransfer](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/QlikDataTransfer/install-Qlik-DataTransfer.htm#anchor-7 "Upgrading Qlik DataTransfer").

  ##### **Backup recommendations:**

  + It is important that you make a backup of the folder C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\DataTransfer and C:\Program Files\Qlik\DataTransfer\services.conf before upgrading. This will make it possible to recover the installation if the upgrade fails.
  + If you have installed Qlik DataTransfer to a folder other than C:\Program Files\Qlik\DataTransfer, then please make a copy of the services.conf file from that folder.
  + If you have changed the default StoragePath in the services.conf file, then make a backup of that folder instead.
  + The services.conf file is reset to the latest release’s defaults during upgrades so the backup is helpful for reapplying any custom user settings.
  + If you are installing or upgrading on machine where Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows is already installed, please make sure you install/upgrade Qlik DataTransfer using Qlik Sense service(s) user account.
  ### System requirements notes

  Please refer to the online help for information about [Qlik DataTransfer system requirements](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/QlikDataTransfer/install-Qlik-DataTransfer.htm#anchor-1 "Qlik DataTransfer system requirements").

  ### Consider migrating to Qlik Data Gateway - Direct Access

  Whenever possible, Qlik recommends using the Qlik Data Gateway - Direct Access to load data from on premises into a Qlik Cloud tenant. The supported databases and the Generic ODBC Connector Package, together with the upcoming support for loading on premises files, can allow you to decommission Qlik DataTransfer servers (and potentially repurpose them for gateways). For more information, see [Qlik Data Gateway - Direct Access](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Gateways/direct-access-gateway.htm "Qlik Data Gateway - Direct Access").

  ### Resolved Defects

  The following Release Notes cover resolved defects for Qlik Cloud. Solved issues and limitations for Qlik Cloud Services are also listed.

  | QB-26556 | Qlik Cloud Alerting: Report tasks not sent for certain users | Fixed a problem where a report task would not be sent for users with view and section access. This was solved by making the access rule more lenient to allow notification creation under certain circumstances. |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | QB-26205 | Visualizations: Cannot rearrange columns in the new Straight Table | Fixed a problem where columns could not be rearranged in the new straight table if the table had conditional columns. |
  | QB-17413 | Qlik Engine: Select statement with preceding load results in faulty lineage | Field-level lineage for SQL/select statements have been refactored to resolve incorrect lineage for complex preceding load statements for SQL queries. |
  | QB-25981 | Incorrect translation: Japanese | Corrected the Japanese translation for "Sorting in search" when working with pivot tables. |
  | QB-26400 | Qlik AutoML: Realtime Predictions returning improper JSON response | Fixed a problem where a 200 response code was sent incorrectly because the correct 4xx code was nested in an array. A fix was implemented to check whether the response is in an array. If it is, it will grab the proper JSON response and send it to the user. |
  | QB-26187 | Qlik Application Automation: Error when using Open File block with FTP connector | Fixed a problem where the Open File block would throw an error when the file was in FTP. |
  | QB-28395 | Qlik Sense: Tooltips do not display for selected dimensions | Fixed a problem that prevented the display of tooltips for selected dimensions in Associative insights. This was due to a missing attribute which has now been restored. |
  | QB-24536 | Data Prep & Insights: Import from SharePoint fails with error message | For some connectors, the same QVD ID (file name) was generated for two table sources, resulting in an error message ("Data could not be added to Data Manager"). We have changed how the QVD ID is generated by adding a load statement and including it in the text to generate the hash. |
  | QB-26965 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Incorrect rendering of heatmap | Fixed a floating error in calculating the number of rows and columns that caused heatmaps to render incorrectly. |
  | QB-25773 | Visualizations: Inconsistent behavior when pressing home/end keys | Fixed a problem that caused inconsistent behavior when pressing the home/end in the search listbox of a filter pane. |
  | QB-27477 | Qlik Engine: Tables with the same expression show different results | Fixed a problem when SET analysis constraints did not correctly limit the number of rows in the hypercube, leading to inconsistent results for the same expression. |
  | QB-28741 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: The listbox 'More' menu for tables and pivot tables closed without changes | When selecting one of the options in the listbox 'More' menu, it closed without applying the changes. The selections are now applied correctly instead of closing the menu. |
  | QB-28299 | Qlik Sense Engine: The Concat function resulted in a faulty lineage | In some cases, when the Concat function was used in combination with the FROM load statement, the Concat function did not add the correct sources for a field, resulting in an faulty lineage graph. The faulty graph assumed that the sources were present and therefore incremented an internal index, which resulted in incorrect relations between nodes. Support for the Concat function has been added for lineage and it will now properly add the sources. |
  | QB-26880 | Qlik Web Connectors: Files stored in a team folder are inaccessible through the Dropbox connector | A new connection parameter was added to access Dropbox team folders and files. The root parameter allows the selection of team root if it's available for authenticated users. |
  | QB-28611 | Qlik Engine: Lineage data API is not working when using Preceding LOAD | Fixed a problem where the /v1/apps/{appId}/data/lineage API returned an empty discriminator for Load From statements with a preceding load. |
  | QB-27988 | Qlik Engine: Syntax error on tab during script execution | Fixed a LOAD script parsing problem when the WHERE clause contains "(". |
  | QB-28658 | Visualizations: Sheet styles not working for newly created apps | Fixed a problem where sheet styles did not persist on new apps. Properties are now bound to the visual elements which show the changes. |
  | QB-28873 | Qlik License: Captcha box not always visible on the the Signed License Definition | Fixed a problem where the Captcha box was not always visible on the Signed License Definition site. |
  | QB-27565 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Added sanity check for invalid column width values, preventing view data crashing | Possibly due to converting a table to a pivot table, the, the values stored in the pivot table properties for column widths were incorrect. When the view data mode was selected, those incorrect values caused the chart to crash. A sanity check has been added to prevent the crash. |
  | QB-28589 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Field titles missing in Chart Exploration | Alternative columns were initially shown without proper titles in the new Qlik Sense straight table's chart exploration.    This happened during sheet editing and when users worked with the exploration feature to add and remove columns. |
  | QB-26786 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Alternative measure & dimension dropdown was not updating correctly | The alternative measure & dimension dropdown did not update correctly when a user edited a chart. This issue has been fixed. |
  | QB-28727 | Visualizations: Not possible to search for bookmark | Now validating bookmark creation date before the formatting date. |
  | QB-27277 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Data Manager custom association field preview not working | Fixed a problem that caused the preview of the custom association fields to stop working when selecting which fields to associate the tables with. |
  | QB-26792 | Qlik Cloud Alerting Services: No option to remove email provider | We have added a new email provider option: "None"  Selecting "None" when another provider is configured, will delete the saved configuration. |
  | QB-26995 | Qlik Cloud Alerting Services: Tabular Reporting task scheduled showing incorrect scheduled dateFixed incorrect time displayed for Report task scheduled date | Fixed a problem where the scheduled column for a Report task would display "tomorrow" when it should have displayed "in 2 days". Reports with this issue would still run at their scheduled time. |
  | QB-27207 | Qlik Cloud Visualizations: Problems when exporting objects from different apps using the capability API | Fixed a problem where the capability API created bookmarks in the wrong app. This caused exporting objects from a mashup to work only for the first app. |
  | QB-27200 | Qlik Engine: Error when setting space of a staged QlikView app in Qlik Cloud | Fixed a problem were setting the space for a staged QlikView app in Qlik Cloud was denied. This was due to an admin access rule which prevented the operation. |
  | QB-27253 | Visualizations: Extra object shown in sheet when redirected from Multi KPI in storytelling | Resolved an issue where an additional object was displayed in the sheet upon redirecting from a Multi KPI in storytelling. The problem was fixed by ensuring the correct state is set when navigating from storytelling to the sheet using Multi KPI. |
  | QB-27315 | Qlik Cloud Hub: Duplicate of a modified app/script retains old name/description | Fixed an issue where upon duplicating an app or a script, which had been renamed or had its description modified, the newly created item would still show the old name and/or description. |
  | QB-27271 | Qlik Cloud: Dialog box not auto-scrolling to bottom when loading data via DLE | Resolved an issue where the dialog box did not automatically scroll to the bottom during data loading via the data load editor (DLE). |

  This is Release notes for a Technical Review and are only available for a limit time. This release note will be archived when November 2024 is released.

  ### What's new in Qlik Sense Technical Preview November 2024

  #### **November** **2024 – Technical Preview**

  **Please note:** For the best experience, we recommend that you install this preview as a "fresh installation" only - not as an upgrade on your current setup. While upgrades are technically possible, they may impact performance. When the Initial Release (IR) version of the November 2024 release is live, upgrades will be fully supported.

  **Distribution to cloud tenants**
  We have removed the dependency on license type, allowing all client-managed subscription models to distribute Qlik Sense apps to a Qlik Cloud tenant.

  **Vizualization and client enhancements**

  + New asset panel with sheet grouping enabled.
  + Improvements to pivot tables, straight tables, and combo charts.
  + User-provided labels in the selection bar.

  **Postgres database support**
  Added support for Postgres versions 15 and 16.

  **Security enhancements**
  If you are using mashups or have cross-site domain setups, add the following response headers to enhance security and control access. These headers help protect against Cross-Site Forgery (CSRF) attacks:

  + Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080/)
  + Access-Control- Allow-Credentials: true
  + Access-Control-Expose-Headers: qlik-csrf-token
  ### Resolved Defects

  #### **Technical Preview November 2024**

  | Key | Title | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | QB-29492 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Variance Waterfall fails to export as PDF or image | Fixed a problem introduced with the February 2024 release which prevented the exporting Variance waterfall to PDF or image. |
  | QB-29401 | Visualizations: Problem replacing invalid dimensions / measures master items | Fixed a problem where replacing dimensions or measures would sometimes fail if they were linked to a non-existing master dimension. |
  | QB-29232 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: The 'More' menu in the filter pane displayed incorrectly | The 'More' menu in filter panes displayed incorrectly under other objects or the assets panel. |
  | QB-29043 | Qlik Engine: Distinct count on key fields incorrectly handling key subsets in reports | In reporting mode, a set expression with a distinct count over a key field was not always calculated correctly. The calculation outcome depended on the table load order and the subset relation of the key in the tables. The reporting calculation now builds an invariant and well-determined field and table state. |
  | QB-29033 | Qlik Sense Platform: WebSocket connection lost | Fixed a problem that would, in some cases, throw an exception that caused the loop WebSocket listener to terminate. |
  | QB-29018 | Qlik Sense Engine: Incorrect library function used for deleting an element from object array | While updating the properties cache for DeleteChild operation, the library function used to remove an element from the childlist object array causes the last element to be moved to the deleted element index. This causes the original order of remaining elements to be changed. Fix is added to use the library function which preserves the order of remaining elements. |
  | QB-29009 | Visualizations: Problems with sheet navigation | Fixed a problem that intermittently prevented opening apps, adding new sheets, and navigating existing sheets. This was solved by optimizing the reranking of sheets whenever there are rank conflicts. |
  | QB-28873 | Qlik License: Captcha box not always visible on the the Signed License Definition | Fixed a problem where the Captcha box was not always visible on the Signed License Definition site. |
  | QB-28865 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Cannot set or unset bookmark as default | Fixed a problem that prevented the setting or unsetting of the default bookmark within an app. |
  | QB-28864 | Qlik Engine: Window script function converts Nulls to text | Fixed a problem where the window function would incorrectly translate loaded null fields to '-' which could then be selected. With this fix, the handling of null values is corrected and null fields remain null. |
  | QB-28741 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: The listbox 'More' menu for tables and pivot tables closed without changes | When selecting one of the options in the listbox 'More' menu, it closed without applying the changes. The selections are now applied correctly instead of closing the menu. |
  | QB-28727 | Visualizations: Not possible to search for bookmark | Now validating bookmark creation date before the formatting date. |
  | QB-28658 | Visualizations: Sheet styles not working for newly created apps | Fixed a problem where sheet styles did not persist on new apps. Properties are now bound to the visual elements which show the changes. |
  | QB-28630 | Visualizations: Incorrect position of data points on a line chart | Fixed a problem that caused data points to be incorrectly positioned on small screens or when zooming to 125%. |
  | QB-28611 | Qlik Engine: Lineage data API is not working when using Preceding LOAD | Fixed a problem where the /v1/apps/{appId}/data/lineage API returned an empty discriminator for Load From statements with a preceding load. |
  | QB-28589 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Field titles missing in Chart Exploration | Alternative columns were initially shown without proper titles in the new Qlik Sense straight table's chart exploration. This happened during sheet editing and when users worked with the exploration feature to add and remove columns. |
  | QB-28453 | Qlik Sense Engine: Dynamic scripts in charts did not add or replace values in the correct rows | When evaluated in a chart, the dynamic scripts did not have access to the context information used to access the source rows. Therefore, they only used one row for all additions and replacements. |
  | QB-28451 | Qlik Sense Engine: Dynamic scripts were not evaluated when expected | The engine only checked if a chart contained expressions when determining if it should be evaluated as a table or a hypercube. This meant that any hypercube modifiers such as dynamic scripts were ignored if the chart did not contain an expression. |
  | QB-28426 | Qlik Enterprise Connectors: Amazon Redshift populating duplicate columns | This enhancement addresses an issue where duplicate columns were being fetched when schemas with the same name existed in both the external schema and the Datashare schema. Now, columns are retrieved only from the selected database schema, ensuring accurate data retrieval and eliminating duplicate columns. |
  | QB-28406 | Qlik Sense: Axios security issue | Fixed a security issue caused by Qlik Sense using an old version of Axios. The was resolved by updating the version of Axios used by Qlik Sense. |
  | QB-28392 | Qlik Enterprise Connectors: Google Big Query Connector - Select dialog | Changing the catalog from dropdown did not refresh the list of databases. |
  | QB-28299 | Qlik Sense Engine: The Concat function resulted in a faulty lineage | In some cases, when the Concat function was used in combination with the FROM load statement, the Concat function did not add the correct sources for a field, resulting in an faulty lineage graph. The faulty graph assumed that the sources were present and therefore incremented an internal index, which resulted in incorrect relations between nodes. Support for the Concat function has been added for lineage and it will now properly add the sources. |
  | QB-28201 | Qlik Engine: Iterator is shown as a non-integer when using large values | Fixed a problem with the string conversion method used in a FOR loop, which caused formatting issues when handling large values. |
  | QB-28142 | Qlik Sense Engine: Missing privileges for connections | Fixed a problem where connections that were fetched using REST API were missing privileges. This would cause the Add data button to be missing from the connection Attached Files. |
  | QB-27988 | Qlik Engine: Syntax error on tab during script execution | Fixed a LOAD script parsing problem when the WHERE clause contains "(". |
  | QB-27933 | Qlik Sense: Date picker library is outdated | Updated momentJS to the latest version. |
  | QB-27902 | Qlik Sense Engine: Hypercube modifier REPLACE LOAD sourced data incorrectly and added rows to chart | When REPLACE LOAD was used in a dynamic chart script, it was using only one row for the source data regardless of the actual number of source rows. It also incorrectly added rows to the chart. |
  | QB-27821 | Resolved UI issue: Restored internal menu functionality in Dev Hub | In the Mashup editor in Dev Hub, the 'Menu' button in the toolbar was inadvertently replaced with a 'Help' button. The issue is resolved and access to the 'Menu' button has been restored. |
  | QB-27754 | Qlik Sense: CORS error blocks external API requests | Fixed an issue with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests that were blocked when making external API requests. The issue was related to the handling of the "withCredentials" option in the requests. |
  | QB-27751 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Overflow on button labels was not displaying correctly with ellipses | The button labels were missing settings for text overflow. CSS settings were added and now the labels work as expected. |
  | QB-27657 | Qlik Sense Engine: Parquet file not deleted | Parquet files were in some cases not deleted after being used. This has been fixed by not using the MemoryMap option when opening Parquet files for reading when the files have been downloaded using a web connector. |
  | QB-27639 | Schedule reload task using custom schedule | When adding a custom filter, some valid format options produced an error. |
  | QB-27632 | Qlik Sense Engine: Incorrect format when exporting a table containing dates | When exporting a table containing dates to Microsoft Excel, the date fields were exported in numeric format, instead of formatted date/time. This has been fixed by treating unformatted date/time values as formatted Excel date/time fields, using default formats that adjust to the viewer's locale. |
  | QB-27623 | "Show totals above" option is missing when converting native Pivot table to Pivot table (Visualization bundle) | An issue was identified in which the "Show totals above" option" is not shown when converting a native Pivot table to the Pivot table from the Visualization bundle. The issue has been resolved by adjusting a setting for indent mode. |
  | QB-27565 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Added sanity check for invalid column width values, preventing view data crashing | Possibly due to converting a table to a pivot table, the, the values stored in the pivot table properties for column widths were incorrect. When the view data mode was selected, those incorrect values caused the chart to crash. A sanity check has been added to prevent the crash. |
  | QB-27477 | Qlik Engine: Tables with the same expression show different results | Fixed a problem when SET analysis constraints did not correctly limit the number of rows in the hypercube, leading to inconsistent results for the same expression. |
  | QB-27393 | Visualizations: Filter pane selection options are not displayed | Fixed a problem where expanding a filter pane caused the buttons for making different selection options (such as more, clear selection, cancel, and confirm)  were not displayed. |
  | QB-27352 | Qlik sense Visualizations: Selection popup and bar is blank when using getGlobal method in a mashup | Fixed a problem where listboxes within mashups could stop working. This problem occurred specifically for mashups created using the Capability API and calling the qlik.getGlobal function. |
  | QB-27348 | Qlik Enterprise Connectors: Invalid Session Token error for Amazon Athena connections | Resolved an issue with the Amazon Athena connector when using a proxy with user name and password to authenticate the connection. The resolution involved fixing the authentication process so that the Proxy Username value entered by the user is properly forwarded to the driver. |
  | QB-27277 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Data Manager custom association field preview not working | Fixed a problem that caused the preview of the custom association fields to stop working when selecting which fields to associate the tables with. |
  | QB-27237 | Qlik Sense: Custom Trigger with double digits causes custom filter validation error | Custom filter now allows the use of double digits for the hourly position for Tasks in the Qlik Management Console. |
  | QB-27227 | Bar chart label incorrect when the result is 1.95 | Fixed floating error on formatting. |
  | QB-27147 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Qlik Sense icon not showing in apps on May 2024 IR | Fixed a problem that caused the favicon to disappear on some apps. |
  | QB-27108 | Visualizations: Exporting object with styling fails | Fixed a problem where exporting any object with shadow values as an image would fail. This was solved by disabling chart shadows on server printing. |
  | QB-27008 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: "Color by expression"  not working in a dimensionless barchart | Fixed an issue where you could not switch to "Color by expression" in a dimensionless barchart and instead it defaulted to single color. |
  | QB-27006 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Incorrect CSS for overflowing content | When the content of a multi KPI could not fit in the height of the object, the data could end up inaccessible to users. By correcting the CSS, the data can always scrolled to the data. |
  | QB-26965 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Incorrect rendering of heatmap | Fixed a floating error in calculating the number of rows and columns that caused heatmaps to render incorrectly. |
  | QB-26946 | Qlik Mobile zooming issue | Prevented users from interacting with a chart in a small device if the browser is zoomed in. |
  | QB-26936 | Qlik Sense Engine: Select and search methods fail to parse search strings starting with certain characters | Search strings starting with any of the following characters: <>\"~()='[] would not be parsed correctly when the user was expecting an exact search. A fix was added which will allow users to force an exact search by adding an extra backslash "\" before any of the special characters (for example, to search for "<x>" enter the search string "\<x>").This fix is disabled by default. To enable it, update the Settings.ini file to include "EnableSpecialCharacterEscapingInSearch = 1". |
  | QB-26902 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: The button object was unclickable in a mashup if the label was too long | Buttons with long labels are now clickable within a mashup. |
  | QB-26880 | Qlik Web Connectors: Files stored in a team folder are inaccessible through the Dropbox connector | A new connection parameter was added to access Dropbox team folders and files. The root parameter allows the selection of team root if it's available for authenticated users. |
  | QB-26872 | Qlik Sense Engine: Resolving issues from open app performance enhancements | There were some issues with connection deletion behavior after implementing performance enhancements for opening apps. These have been resolved. |
  | QB-26840 | Qlik Sense Engine: The <CreatorDoc> tag is empty in QVDs created with Qlik Sense February 2024 | Fixed a problem where the <CreatorDoc> tag in the metadata of QVD files created with Qlik Sense February 2024 was empty, instead of showing the app ID that generated the QVD. <CreatorDoc> tags are now written from the STORE statement, even if the format spec is omitted. |
  | QB-26786 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Alternative measure & dimension dropdown was not updating correctly | The alternative measure & dimension dropdown did not update correctly when a user edited a chart. This issue has been fixed. |
  | QB-26669 | Qlik Sense Engine: Problem exporting straight table to Excel | Fixed a problem with handling the pre-generated format string for Euro during Excel export from the Qlik Engine. |
  | QB-26657 | Qlik Sense Visualizations: Qlik extensions lost custom properties after server restart | Three extensions did not have the version specified correctly:- sn-layout-container- sh-shape- sn-textThe versions are now updated properly in all files for these extensions |
  | QB-26613 | Qlik Engine: Dimension created with Aggr function does not fully support selection | Fixed an issue that would cause some apps to have a limited ability to make selections in a dimension created using the Aggr function. |
  | QB-26558 | Qlik Engine: Connector performance reload issues in Qlik Sense February 2024 | The Select Statement Lineage for Sense Server has been disabled as it served no purpose in Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows. This was causing issues with some connectors by making irrelevant calls in Sense Server. |
  | QB-26530 | Qlik Sense: Custom Cache Control settings not maintained with server reboot | Enhanced the Hub service to use a retry mechanism, allowing it to wait for the QRS API's /ContentCacheControl endpoint to respond. |
  | QB-26504 | Qlik Cloud Engine: Line Chart not showing all values for X-axis | Fixed an issue that would, in some apps, exclude the highest magnitude dimension value from a chart using a continuous x-axis. This could happen when the data point's x-axis value was encoded using more than the 15-digit precision used in the QIX Engine |
  | QB-26486 | Qlik Sense on Windows: Straight table columns unusable with auto width | Fixed a problem where columns in straight tables using auto width became unusable. The minimum width has been increased to 120px. |
  | QB-26447 | Visualizations: Some table column headers do not wrap | Due to an indexing error in the table code, the showing/hiding header icons and wrapping header text, were based on the wrong column. These calculations now use the correct index and the text wrap and icons are shown correctly. |
  | QB-26407 | Qlik Sense: Node.js updated | Node.js has been updated to version 18.20.4. |
  | QB-26392 | Qlik Sense on Windows: Failing requests to fetch custom brand spam console | Fixed a problem where requests specific to the Qlik Cloud Services offering were made on Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows deployment causing the failing requests to spam the console. |
  | QB-26205 | Visualizations: Cannot rearrange columns in the new Straight Table | Fixed a problem where columns could not be rearranged in the new straight table if the table had conditional columns. |
  | QB-26199 | Visualizations: Undo button not working | Fixed a problem where the undo button was unresponsive after unlinking a master dimension. |
  | QB-26106 | Qlik Engine: HypercubeEvaluator calculation error | Fixed a problem in a hypercube calculation that returned a row even when the selection result was empty. After the fix now rows should be returned. |
  | QB-26098 | Scatter plot labels | Fixed a problem with the rendering of the scatter plot during changes in viewing data. |
  | QB-25981 | Incorrect translation: Japanese | Corrected the Japanese translation for "Sorting in search" when working with pivot tables. |
  | QB-25920 | Qlik Engine: Unable to filter text values of QVD in Data Manager | Fixed a problem where the filtering of a text field for QVD files was not working. If the field type was a string but the filter value was a number (for example: 1), the filter would not work. This has been fixed by forcing the columns to be interpreted as text. |
  | QB-25909 | Qlik Sense on Windows: Unsupported trigger time zone reported as (GMT + 0000) | This adds a fix for setting Daylight Savings Time to Permanent Standard Time if the time zone is not supported by the Qlik Management Console (QMC). |
  | QB-25871 | Qlik Engine: Cannot reference iterator value using $() in chart script | In a chart script, the iterator in a "For… Next" loop could not be used in a dollar expansion expression. This has now been fixed. |
  | QB-25773 | Visualizations: Inconsistent behavior when pressing home/end keys | Fixed a problem that caused inconsistent behavior when pressing the home/end in the search listbox of a filter pane. |
  | QB-25730 | Qlik Sense Engine: Inner set expression issue when outer set expression is present | Fixed an issue that caused the miscalculation of inner set expressions when outer set expressions were present. The inner set expression {<Field1=StateA::Field1>} will now read Field1 correctly from StateA even when an outer set expression is present. |
  | QB-25031 | Qlik Web Connectors: Unable to load data from Odata database via Qlik Odata connector | Fixed a problem where a "System.OutOfMemoryException" would be thrown if the OData connector returned a large response. This was solved by accepting smaller values in the Max depth parameter. Additionally, new tables have been added to retrieve information (V4GetSchemas, V4GetEntities, and V4GetProperties). |
  | QB-25016 | Qlik Sense: Issue with display scaling on Qlik Sense on Windows February 2024 | Fixed a problem with scaling present on high DPI monitors. |
  | QB-24997 | Qlik Sense on Windows: Exception importing sheets to NPrinting May 2023 | Fixed a problem on the main-web-container component shipped with QSEoW that caused NPrinting exports of extended Sense sheets to fail when a Sense app carded theme was used. |
  | QB-24968 | Qlik Web Connectors: Error when importing a table using the Qlik ODATA connector | Fixed a problem that caused an error ("Sequence contains no elements") when retrieving data from the JsonV4GetData table. With this fix, paces in path parameter values are now processed correctly. |
  | QB-24536 | Data Prep & Insights: Import from SharePoint fails with error message | For some connectors, the same QVD ID (file name) was generated for two table sources, resulting in an error message ("Data could not be added to Data Manager"). We have changed how the QVD ID is generated by adding a load statement and including it in the text to generate the hash. |
  | QB-23881 | Qlik Sense: User details exposed in WebSockets (CWE-200 | Fixed a vulnerability problem where user details were exposed in WebSockets (CWE-200 information exposure). This was solved by hiding the owner data for Anonymous User Context in AppPropList and the Owner data in the Hub App Card for Anonymous User Context. |
  | QB-23565 | Improved HTTP header validation | Improved HTTP communication by providing additional header validations. |

  ###

  ### Known issues and limitations

  The following issues and limitations were identified at release time. The list is not comprehensive but lists all known major issues and limitations.

  #### **Clients**

  + Third-party extensions are currently not supported on mobile devices, and the Qlik Trusted Extension Developer program does not accredit extensions for use on mobile devices. Generated items might not be visualized properly on a mobile device, depending on individual device specifications, mobile OS, and the size of the Qlik Sense app.
  + When you consume Qlik Sense apps using the Microsoft Edge browser on touch/hybrid devices, the long-press action does not work. This prevents you from accessing functions such as an object’s context menu, which requires a long press in touch mode. This is a Microsoft Edge issue.
    **Workaround:** If you use a hybrid device, turn off touch mode, and then turn it back on again.
  + Export as Anonymous does not work for mashups deployed in a domain that is different from the domain where Qlik Sense is installed. Export only works for Anonymous if the mashup is deployed in the same domain as Qlik Sense.
  + When using the new Load Extension syntax in the load script, the Data Load Editor syntax completion does not work well after the keyword “Extension” when trying to write the call to an SSE function (AAI function). The script still executes correctly.
  + Legend does not show dimension values after row number 3000.
  + Limitations when exporting a story to PowerPoint:
    - Titles are not rescaled as HTML. Font settings are not exported.
    - Storytelling effects are not applied.
    - Exported charts might show fixed scroll bars, depending on the export resolution.
  + It is not possible to open the context menu of an org chart on a touch device.
  + When you choose to view data in the context menu in a dynamic chart and make a new selection in the app, you need to refresh the browser for the chart to be displayed again.
  #### **Dynamic views**

  + Dynamic views that you delete from one app are also deleted from every other app that was using the same view. There is no workaround for this issue. Avoid deleting views that might already be in use by other apps.
  + When you create a new dynamic view in the assets pane, the dropdown menu item does not automatically change to show the charts of the newly created dynamic view if there are any existing dynamic views. You must click on the dropdown menu to choose the newly created view.
  + The data for a dynamic view is automatically refreshed whenever you open a sheet that contains charts for the view. The same happens when you enter and then return from the global selections pane, and when you add a new chart for the view. Refrain from performing these actions on the base app to prevent triggering refreshes.
  + The view of a dynamic chart is cleared and shows a message indicating a view constraint violation whenever you change the selection state of the base app in a way that violates the view's constraints. Refrain from changing the selection state of the base app until it has finished making use of the data in any of the dynamic view charts.
  + The ‘Go to source’ option on a snapshot slide (available on right-click) for a dynamic chart does not select the actual dynamic chart when you change the view to the base app sheet.
  + Changes to chart settings for dynamic view charts using the Exploration menu are lost after refreshing the view.
  + Dynamic views do not support the Trellis extension.
  #### **Managing a Qlik Sense site**

  + The Edit pane under Custom properties in the Qlik Management Console (QMC) can currently handle a limited number of custom properties. If you want to edit custom property values in the QMC, we recommend keeping the number of custom property values to a maximum of 500. If you want to apply values without modifying them, the QMC can handle up to 10,000 custom property values.
  + When you remove app objects from an application via the QMC interface, deleted objects are not removed from the application’s binary file stored on the file system.
  + It is not possible to use a security rule on the HubSection\_\* resource to hide the ‘Open hub’ link from the navigation menu when accessing an app as an anonymous user.
    **Workaround:** Use reverse proxy to redirect the ‘Open hub’ link to a preferred landing site.
  + Windows service Qlik Engine cannot be started on a node where the Qlik Engine service is disabled through the QMC. Every time Windows restarts for that node, the Qlik Engine service fails to start up and throws an error in Windows event logs. You can prevent this by temporarily disabling the Qlik Engine service in Windows Service Manager.
  + Data connection passwords containing special characters (such as "=", "%", or ";") are not properly encoded when updated via the QMC. This causes authentication errors when trying to connect to specific data sources, which could cause reload tasks to fail.
    **Workaround:** Use the data load editor to update the password. Note that once the password is updated, the name of the data connection is automatically appended by "(domain\_userId)". You can adjust this later via the QMC.
  #### **Qlik Sense Desktop**

  + Qlik Sense Desktop can play WebM and Ogg but not MP4 files. This is due to limitations in Chromium.
  #### **Connectors**

  + REST connector: The ‘Next token’ pagination option does not work when the pagination token has the same value for each page.
  + For connectors in the ODBC Connector Package only the data types listed as supported in the online help have been verified to work correctly in the Preview and Script editor. However, the ODBC Connector Package does not prevent you from loading other data types. In some cases, you can load unsupported data types with the load script.
  + ODBC connector: Database connectors in the ODBC Connector Package do not work properly if the username on the Microsoft Windows system running Qlik Sense Desktop contains letters that are not English alphanumeric characters.
    **Workaround**: Change the Windows system locale to match the character set that contains the characters used in the username. For example, if the system locale on the system running Qlik Sense Desktop is set to English and a username contains Swedish characters, you must change the system locale to Swedish for the ODBC connector to work properly.
  + The Qlik Salesforce connector does not support PK chunking on sharing objects. PK chunking is only supported on parent objects.
  + The Apache Phoenix connector does not support non-Latin characters in metadata. The connector might return corrupted data or unpredictable query results if you run a query with non-Latin characters in metadata, such as table names, column names, and aliases.
  #### **Cloud deployments and Multi-Cloud**

  + When you download a pivot table in Qlik Sense Enterprise SaaS, expanded rows are not included but stay collapsed.

  ## Migration and Upgrade

  Before upgrading, it's important to review the migration and upgrade considerations below.

  ### Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 Upgrade/Installation Prerequisite

  + Using the Setup Wizard - It is preferable for .NET Framework 4.8 to be installed on the Enterprise Manager Server machine before running Setup. If .NET Framework 4.8 is not present on the machine, Setup will prompt you to install it. This November require the machine to be rebooted when the installation completes.
  + Silent Installation – The ISS file required for silently installing Enterprise Manager must be created on a machine that already has .NET 4.8 installed on it.
  ### Upgrade paths

  Qlik supports four Enterprise Manager versions (including this one).

  Direct upgrade is supported from the last two versions only (including any service releases for those versions). The last two versions are Enterprise Manager November 2023 and Enterprise May 2024.

  #### Upgrading from Enterprise Manager April 2020 (6.6)

  If you are upgrading from Enterprise Manager April 2020 (6.6), first upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2020 (7.0), then upgrade to Enterprise Manager May 2021, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager May 2022, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2022, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2023, and finally upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2024.

  #### Upgrading from unsupported versions

  If you are upgrading from Enterprise Manager 6.x (starting from 6.3), you first need to upgrade to Enterprise Manager 6.5, then to Enterprise Manager November 2020 (7.0), then to Enterprise Manager May 2021, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager May 2022, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2022, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2023, and finally upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2024.

  If you are upgrading from Enterprise Manager 3.3, please contact Qlik Support.

  ## What's new

  Learn about new features and improvements in [Qlik Replicate](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/replicate/Content/Replicate/Main/Release_Notes/features.htm "What's new in Qlik Replicate November 2024").

  ## Migration and upgrade

  This section describes the issues that you may encounter when upgrading/migrating to the new version.

  ### Upgrade paths

  Qlik supports four Replicate versions (including this one).

  Direct upgrade is supported from the last two versions only (including any service releases for those versions). The last two versions are Replicate November 2023 and Replicate May 2024.

  #### Upgrading from Replicate April 2020 (6.6)

  If you are upgrading from Replicate April 2020 (6.6), you need to perform the following upgrades:

  1. Upgrade to Replicate November 2020 (7.0).
  2. Upgrade to Replicate November 2021.
  3. Upgrade to Replicate November 2022.
  4. Upgrade to Replicate May 2023 SR.
  5. Upgrade to Replicate November 2023 SR
  6. Upgrade to Replicate November 2024.
  #### Upgrading from unsupported versions

  If you are upgrading from Replicate 6.x (starting from 6.3), you need to perform the following upgrades:

  1. Upgrade to Replicate 6.5.
  2. Upgrade to Replicate November 2020 (7.0).
  3. Upgrade to Replicate November 2021.
  4. Upgrade to Replicate November 2022.
  5. Upgrade to Replicate May 2023 SR.
  6. Upgrade to Replicate November 2023 SR
  7. Upgrade to Replicate November 2024.

  **Note:** If you are upgrading from Replicate 5.5, please contact Qlik Support.

  ### Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 upgrade/installation prerequisite

  + Using the Setup Wizard - It is preferable for .NET Framework 4.8 to be installed on the Replicate Server machine before running Setup. If .NET Framework 4.8 is not present on the machine, Setup will prompt you to install it. This may require the machine to be rebooted once the installation completes.
  + Silent Installation – When recording an Install Shield Silent response file (ISS), the recording must be done on a machine with .NET 4.8 already installed on it as the silent installation process does not include a separate installation of .NET framework 4.8.
  ### Deleting the Replicate self-signed certificate after upgrade

  **Note:** This procedure does not need to be performed when upgrading from Replicate November 2022 or later.

  After upgrading, customers that are using Replicate's self-signed certificate (i.e. instead of their own certificate) should perform the following procedure:

  1. Delete all **\*.pem** files from <replicate\_data\_folder>/ssl/data.
  2. Restart the **Qlik Replicate Server** service.

  This will cause Replicate to generate a new self-signed certificate, thereby ensuring that the certificate will be accepted by newer clients (browsers) that select the more secure TLS 1.3 protocol.

  Note that if you do not perform the above procedure, the following error will be encountered when connecting to Replicate Console:

  ```
  SYS,GENERAL_EXCEPTION,The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel.
  ```
  ### Upgrading an installation with multiple data folders

  When upgrading a Replicate installation with multiple Data folders, only the default Data folder (<Product\_Dir>\Data) will be automatically upgraded. The other Data folders need to be updated manually by running the following command:

  ```
  repuictl.exe -d <data_folder_path> setup install
  ```
  ### Compatibility with related Qlik products

  This version of Replicate is compatible with the following related products only:

  + Enterprise Manager November 2024 or later
  + Compose November 2023 or later
  + Compose for Data Lakes April 2020 (6.6)
  ## End of life/support features

  This section provides information about End of Life versions, End of Support features, and deprecated features.

  ### End of support

  #### Endpoint versions

  Support for the following endpoint versions has been discontinued:

  + PostgreSQL 12.x
  + IBM DB2 for z/OS: z/OS 2.4
  + Databricks 9.1
  + MongoDB 5.x

  **Description:** Added an internal parameter: printCSVFileNamesInInfo

  When the parameter is set to TRUE (and logging is set to INFO or higher), the Replicate IMS source endpoint will write CSV file names and their creation date to the Replicate log.

  As turning on the parameter will increase the log size, customers should monitor it to avoid storage issues. To reduce the logging impact, best practice is to maintain only a reasonable backlog of CSV files, and to delete CSV files that have already been applied to target. If the log size becomes excessive, set the parameter to FALSE to stop the additional logging.

  ## Upgrade notes

  ### Upgrading when using certificates for authorization

  If a standard Upgrade is done, new certificates will be created using the AES 256

  GCM mode as part of the upgrade.

  Instructions for upgrading QlikView with new certificates mode (GCM) – Before implementing this, TLS 1.2 has to be enabled for QVS to work normally.

  Perform the upgrade on all machines in the cluster.

  After completion, the installer will ask you to restart the machine/s.

  After restart and services are running, stop all the services and open "C:\Program Files\QlikView\Management Service\QVManagementService.exe.config" and apply the following config:

   <add key="InstallingNewCertificatesAndCryptoKey" value="true"></add>

  If Services are clustered, all the cluster nodes also need the new certificate.

  Add into resp config files for each (one on each node):

  <add key="InstallingNewCertificatesAndCryptoKey" value="true"></add>

  or

  InstallingNewCertificatesAndCryptoKey=1 if QVS.

  Start the QMS first and then rest of all services

  In the QMC, go to the service’s System/setup, for example if QDS select the node and distribute the new certificates to QDS machine with Apply in setup and follow the popup instructions. Do this for one service om each node to distribute new certs mode. Stop QMS again and all services. Make above configuration false in all config/settings files

  "<add key="InstallingNewCertificatesAndCryptoKey" value="false"></add>".

  Start all services. All machines in the cluster shall now have the new certs mode.

  If you for some reason need to downgrade to the previous version again, follow this

  Support Article to re-generate certificates using the old encryption algorithm.

  #### Upgrading from Enterprise Manager April 2020 (6.6)

  If you are upgrading from Enterprise Manager April 2020 (6.6), first upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2020 (7.0), then upgrade to Enterprise Manager May 2021, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager May 2022, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2022, and finally upgrade to Enterprise Manager May 2024.

  #### Upgrading from unsupported versions

  If you are upgrading from Enterprise Manager 6.x (starting from 6.3), you first need to upgrade to Enterprise Manager 6.5, then to Enterprise Manager November 2020 (7.0), then to Enterprise Manager May 2021, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager May 2022, then upgrade to Enterprise Manager November 2022, and finally upgrade to Enterprise Manager May 2024.

  ## What's new

  Learn about new features and improvements in [Qlik Replicate](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/replicate/May2024/Content/Replicate/Main/Release_Notes/features.htm "What's new in Qlik Replicate May 2024").

  ## Migration and upgrade

  This section describes the issues that you may encounter when upgrading/migrating to the new version.

  ### Upgrade paths

  Qlik supports four Replicate versions (including this one).

  Direct upgrade is supported from the last two versions only (including any service releases for those versions). The last two versions are Replicate May 2023 and Replicate November 2023.

  #### Upgrading from Replicate April 2020 (6.6)

  If you are upgrading from Replicate April 2020 (6.6), you need to perform the following upgrades:

  1. Upgrade to Replicate November 2020 (7.0).
  2. Upgrade to Replicate November 2021.
  3. Upgrade to Replicate November 2022.
  4. Upgrade to Replicate May 2023.
  5. Upgrade to Replicate May 2024.
  #### Upgrading from unsupported versions

  If you are upgrading from Replicate 6.x (starting from 6.3), you need to perform the following upgrades:

  1. Upgrade to Replicate 6.5.
  2. Upgrade to Replicate November 2020 (7.0).
  3. Upgrade to Replicate November 2021.
  4. Upgrade to Replicate November 2022.
  5. Upgrade to Replicate May 2023.
  6. Upgrade to Replicate May 2024.

  **Note:** If you are upgrading from Replicate 5.5, please contact Qlik Support.

  ### Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 upgrade/installation prerequisite

  + Using the Setup Wizard - It is preferable for .NET Framework 4.8 to be installed on the Replicate Server machine before running Setup. If .NET Framework 4.8 is not present on the machine, Setup will prompt you to install it. This may require the machine to be rebooted once the installation completes.
  + Silent Installation – When recording an Install Shield Silent response file (ISS), the recording must be done on a machine with .NET 4.8 already installed on it as the silent installation process does not include a separate installation of .NET framework 4.8.
  ### Deleting the Replicate self-signed certificate after upgrade

  **Note:** This procedure does not need to be performed when upgrading from Replicate November 2022 or later.

  After upgrading, customers that are using Replicate's self-signed certificate (i.e. instead of their own certificate) should perform the following procedure:

  1. Delete all **\*.pem** files from <replicate\_data\_folder>/ssl/data.
  2. Restart the **Qlik Replicate Server** service.

  This will cause Replicate to generate a new self-signed certificate, thereby ensuring that the certificate will be accepted by newer clients (browsers) that select the more secure TLS 1.3 protocol.

  Note that if you do not perform the above procedure, the following error will be encountered when connecting to Replicate Console:

  ```
  SYS,GENERAL_EXCEPTION,The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel.
  ```
  ### Upgrading an installation with multiple data folders

  When upgrading a Replicate installation with multiple Data folders, only the default Data folder (<Product\_Dir>\Data) will be automatically upgraded. The other Data folders need to be updated manually by running the following command:

  ```
  repuictl.exe -d <data_folder_path> setup install
  ```
  ### Compatibility with related products

  This version of Replicate is compatible with the following related products only:

  + Enterprise Manager May 2024 or later
  + Compose November 2023 or later
  + Compose for Data Lakes April 2020 (6.6)
  ### Required post-upgrade steps for tasks with a SAP ODP source endpoint

  When upgrading from Replicate versions earlier than Replicate May 2023 SP2, you must perform the following steps in the Replicate Console after the upgrade completes:

  1. Select **Advanced Run Options** from the **Run** menu.
  2. Choose **Metadata Only**  and then select **Create missing tables and then stop**. Click **OK**.
  3. The task will run, collect missing metadata, and then stop.
  4. Resume the task after it stops.
  ## End of life/support features

  This section provides information about End of Life versions, End of Support features, and deprecated features.

  ### Endpoint versions that are no longer supported

  Support for the following endpoint versions has been discontinued:

  + All Oracle versions and drivers earlier than Oracle 19.x
  + SQL Server 2014
  + MySQL 5.7
  + PostgreSQL 11
  + Kafka 2.x
  + IBM DB2 for LUW 10.5
  + IBM DB2 for z/OS: z/OS 2.3
  + MongoDB 4.4

  The following release notes cover the versions of Qlik NPrinting released in May 2023 Service Release 6.

  ### Improvements

  #### SMTP connection retry configuration

  Jira issue ID: OP-96021

  Two new parameters have been added to the *scheduler.config* configuration file:

  + *max-mail-client-connection-attempts*: Specifies the maximum number of attempts to connect to the email server. The default value is 2.
  + *mail-client-connection-attempts-delay-ms*: Specifies the delay, in milliseconds, before retrying after a failed connection. The default value is 500 ms.

  To customize these parameters, you must uncomment them in the configuration file.

  Additionally, this security improvement introduces a breaking change to the email client: certificate validation no longer accepts untrusted self-signed certificates. To use untrusted self-signed certificates, you will need to disable validation in the SMTP configuration or convert the certificates to trusted (trusted root store).

  #### Third party libraries updated

  Jira issue ID: OP-96012, OP-96013
  The following third-party libraries have been updated and patched to the latest releases:

  + AngularJS
  + NHibernate
  + Bouncy Castle
  + PostgreSQL (Qlik NPrinting Repository)
  ### Resolved Defects

  #### Import tasks now ignore hidden cells

  Jira issue ID: QB-26555

  Import user tasks now ignore hidden cells in all worksheets of imported Excel files.

  #### On-Demand requests with a large number of selections caused the Engine stop

  Jira issue ID: OP-96031

  Running On-Demand requests with an extremely large number of selections, exceeding tens of thousands, caused the Qlik NPrinting Engine Windows service to stop.

  ### Known issues and limitations

  The following issues and limitations were identified at release time. The list is not comprehensive; it lists all known major issues and limitations. We expect to have these issues fixed in future versions.

  #### Supported languages

  The following languages are supported:

  + English
  + French
  + German
  + Spanish
  + Brazilian Portuguese
  + Japanese
  + Italian
  + Simplified Chinese

  Other languages are not officially supported. There may be issues with other languages, particularly those with right-to-left script and non-Roman alphabets.

  #### Qlik Sense custom size sheets

  Qlik Sense custom size sheets are not supported. Custom size will not be maintained on export.
  Alternate states
  QlikView and Qlik Sense alternate states are not supported.

  #### Alternate states

  QlikView and Qlik Sense alternate states are not supported.

  #### Qlik NPrinting must be installed only on C: drives

  Jira issue ID: OP-6196
  Qlik NPrinting Server, Engine, and Designer can only be installed on C: drives. Any attempt to install them on a different drive will result in task failures.

  #### Image size settings are not respected when adding the same object twice

  Jira issue ID: OP-5831
  When you add the same object twice, using the Images node in Qlik NPrinting Designer, only the image size property of the first image is respected.

  #### QlikView On-Demand reports cannot be connected to Qlik Sense

  It is possible to select the “Enable” check box in On-Demand for reports using Qlik Sense app data. These reports are visible in the QlikView On-Demand menu of the QlikView On-Demand add-on. But if selected, they will not generate reports, and you will see an error message.

  #### Qlik NPrinting Designer crashes sometimes with zoomed screen settings

  If you experience random crashes when using Qlik NPrinting Designer, open your Windows Display Settings in the Control Panel and verify that Smaller – 100% (default) is selected. When settings of 125% or 150% are selected, Qlik NPrinting Designer may crash.

  #### On-Demand works in Chrome and Firefox, but not in Internet Explorer (11 or older) or Edge

  Jira issue ID: OP-5908
  In some cases, when you use Qlik NPrinting On-Demand in Internet Explorer 11 or Edge, the “origin” HTTP header is not generated. This results in the error message “REVEL\_CSRF: tokens mismatch”.
  The workaround is to install Qlik NPrinting On-Demand on a Microsoft IIS server hosting QlikView Access point or use a different web browser.

  #### Too many users and filters leads to Qlik NPrinting Designer errors

  Jira issue ID: OP-4940
  Qlik NPrinting Designer may be unable to open a report template if there are too many filters associated with a connection in the report's app. The following error message displays: “A task was canceled”.
  This typically happens when more than 4000 filters are using fields from a connection. Sometimes, higher numbers can work. For example, 7000 filters have worked in some situations.
  The workaround is:
  1. Split the Qlik NPrinting app into separate apps.
  2. Split the connections (possibly by using multiple connections to the same documents in different apps).
  3. Split the filters across apps (so that the filter count per app is lower).

  #### Task fails with the error 'Exceeded maximum number of retries'

  Jira issue ID: OP-4839
  Some Qlik NPrinting tasks fail with the error message: “Exceeded maximum number of retries”. This is due to a performance issue in QlikView that appears when it exports large unfiltered files to Excel.

  #### Verify connection freezes during “Initializing…” status

  Jira issue ID: OP-5278
  In some rare circumstances, pressing the Verify connection button will cause the screen to freeze on the “Initializing…” status and the spinning wheel cursor. This happens when a Qlik NPrinting Engine goes offline and Verify connection is pressed before the Qlik NPrinting Scheduler is aware that it is offline. It can take up to 20 seconds before the Qlik NPrinting Scheduler determines the offline status of a Qlik NPrinting Engine.

  #### User filters are excluded from matching and object filters

  Jira issue ID: OP-5914
  When you:

  + Open Qlik NPrinting Designer
  + Import a report

  The filters associated with each user are not uploaded, or displayed, for performance reasons. Waiting for all filters for thousands of users to import would take a long time. In most cases, importing this information is unnecessary, because filters created for users often contain something like the user IDs. You can change this behavior and make all filters visible by uncommenting the line <!--<add key="include-user-filters" />--> in the webengine.config file.
  To make a specific filter visible in the lists, remove its association to all users, or create a new filter with the same fields and values not linked to any user.

  #### Cancelling an upgrade results in a corrupted environment

  Jira issue ID: OP-3986
  The rollback that follows a Qlik NPrinting Server or Engine upgrade cancellation may corrupt the related Qlik NPrinting installation. A rollback is triggered by errors or by clicking the cancel button during the upgrade execution. After a corruption caused by a rollback, services may be uninstalled or cannot be started.
  To restore a Qlik NPrinting Server to its original status:

  + Retrieve a recent backup
  + Uninstall Qlik NPrinting Server
  + Perform a clean installation of the same Qlik NPrinting Server of the backup
  + Restore the backup

  You should always create a backup before starting an update. In any case, a backup is automatically created in the folder "%ProgramData%\NPrinting" at the beginning of the upgrade process. To restore a Qlik NPrinting Engine to original status:

  + Uninstall Qlik NPrinting Engine
  + Perform a clean installation of Qlik NPrinting Engine
  #### Adding a title to a Sense object with Assistance on generates an error on preview or task

  Jira issue ID: OP-7560
  Add title functionality is not supported on Qlik Sense objects with Assistance mode enabled. The workaround to restore the Add title functionality is to disable Assistance mode for the chart in Qlik Sense. Then reload the metadata of the connection.

  #### Cannot export tables, columns, and cells from Qlik Sense objects made using chart suggestions

  Jira issue ID: OP-7568
  Qlik Sense objects made in Assistance mode cannot be used as tables, columns, or cells in Qlik NPrinting. To restore them, disable Assistance mode on the chart in Qlik Sense; then reload the metadata of the connection. Furthermore, if a Qlik Sense object made with Assistance mode is exported as a table, column, or cell using Qlik NPrinting APIs, the request will fail.

  #### Open Type Fonts (\*.otf) are not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-7165
  Open Type Fonts (\*.otf) are not supported in PixelPerfect templates. Generated reports will use a different font, and not look as expected.

  #### Qlik Sense tables with conditionally shown columns have limited functionality

  Jira issue ID: OP-7747
  The following functionalities are not supported for Qlik Sense tables that have a "Show column if" condition set on one or more of their columns: levels, single column export, and keep source formats.

  #### Qlik Sense On-Demand reports with selections on calculated dimensions fails

  Jira issue ID: OP-8382
  Qlik Sense On-Demand reports with selections applied on calculated dimensions will fail. However, you can apply selections on dimensions based on Qlik Sense fields. The workaround is to move the formula to the load script and use the calculated fields to apply selections to your On-Demand reports.

  #### Qlik Sense histograms cannot be add into the Tables node

  Jira issue ID: OP-8985
  Due to the internal way of exporting Qlik Sense histograms, you cannot add them to the Qlik NPrinting Designer Tables node. If you add a Qlik Sense histogram to the Tables node, you will not receive any errors or warning messages, but the exported data will be wrong.

  #### QlikEntities limitation with Qlik Sense entities

  Jira issue ID: OP-8921
  QlikEntity reports support Qlik Sense objects with the following limitations:

  + Containers are not supported, but you can use all the objects that are inside containers.
  + Qlik Sense sheets can be added to QlikEntity reports and exported as images. The "Extend Sheet" feature does not work.
  + Export in PDF and TIFF is not supported.
  #### Embedding Excel worksheets into PowerPoint templates is not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-9087
  You cannot embed an Excel worksheet in a PowerPoint report template. This will cause a Qlik NPrinting Designer crash. The workarounds are to insert the Excel worksheet without using the Qlik NPrinting Designer:

  + Create a .pptx file by using PowerPoint without involving the Qlik NPrinting Designer. Insert the Excel worksheet and save the .pptx. Then use the .pptx file as a report template.
  + If you have already created the PowerPoint template, export it, open the .zip file generated by Qlik NPrinting and double-click the .pptx file inside. Insert the Excel worksheet, save the resulting PowerPoint and overwrite the exiting Qlik NPrinting template by uploading the updated .zip.
  #### Qlik Sense dynamic views limitations

  Jira issue ID: OP-9067
  Dynamic views is a new Qlik Sense feature starting from June 2020.
  If you connect Qlik NPrinting to a Qlik Sense app that contains a chart used to generate dynamic views, the chart and the containing sheet are excluded from the Qlik NPrinting connection cache and cannot be used in reports.
  You can connect Qlik NPrinting to a Qlik Sense app containing dynamic views. However, after a dynamic view refresh, the connection will stop working.

  #### Reports size limit

  Jira issue ID: OP-9628
  Starting from November 2020, RabbitMQ Server (deployed as Qlik NPrinting Messaging Service) has been updated to version 3.8.3. It has an internal limit, not configurable, about messages size of 512MB. Previous limit was 2GB. As consequence, is not possible to generate Qlik NPrinting reports bigger than 512MB.

  #### Excel print area with more than one range

  Jira issue ID: OP-9766
  Excel worksheet print areas can contain more than one range if the generation of the report does not expand the print area. If it expands, you will see an error: “Invalid Cell Name”. For example, the default setting of the Expand Range option in a Qlik NPrinting table causes the print area to change during report production, and an error is received.

  #### Searching in Cyrillic characters is case sensitive

  Jira issue ID: OP-9518
  Using Cyrillic characters in the Search form of the Qlik NPrinting user interface is case sensitive.

  #### The percentage "%" format is not kept in Excel reports

  Jira issue ID: OP-9995
  The percentage “%” format is not kept in Excel reports when using QlikView 12.50 (12.50.20000) or newer due to a QlikView issue. You can solve this by upgrading to QlikView May 2021 SR2 (12.60.20200) or newer.

  #### Run verification does not check if the installed version of QlikView Desktop supports QVF

  Jira issue ID: OP-95599

  If you start a Run Verification on a connection to a QlikView document in QVF format, Qlik NPrinting cannot confirm whether the QlikView Desktop version installed locally on each Qlik NPrinting Engine is compatible with QVF file format. The check mark next to "QlikView can open the document" may be green, even if a version of QlikView that does not support QVF is installed. This is because verification only checks file permissions. If the installed QlikView Desktop does not support QVF format, metadata generation will fail.

  #### QlikView objects with many fields with the same label are not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-95682

  QlikView objects with many different fields with exactly the same label are not supported. Duplicated labels cause an exception during the connection cache generation. To solve this issue, ensure that each field has a unique label.

  #### Images defined by URL in Qlik Sense tables are exported as text

  Jira issue ID: OP-95797

  Images linked by using URLs in Qlik Sense tables are exported as text. This affects only Qlik Sense connections. A workaround exists for PixelPerfect templates.

  #### Microsoft Sensitivity Labels Are Not Supported

  Jira issue ID: HLP-17139

  The sensitivity labels feature in Microsoft Office is not supported. If used, report generation and preview will fail with errors.

  If you have a version of Qlik NPrinting older than April 2018, you must upgrade to Qlik NPrinting April 2018 before you can upgrade to Qlik NPrinting May 2023 SR6.

  If you have a version of Qlik NPrinting older than 17.3, you must first upgrade to Qlik NPrinting 17.3. Then you must upgrade to a version from April 2018 to May 2021 SR4 before you can upgrade to Qlik NPrinting May 2023 SR6.

  If you are upgrading from a version older than February 2018, all metadata caches (QlikView and Qlik Sense) will be marked as "not generated". This is due to a breaking change in the format of the metadata cache. All connection caches must be regenerated before you can edit a template or create a new connection.

  You must back up your data before you proceed. Data can become damaged if a problem occurs during the
  upgrade. If data is damaged, a backup is required to restore the repository. See: [Backup and restore of a](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/May2023/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Backup-restore.htm "Backup and restore of a repository")
  [repository](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/May2022/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Backup-restore.htm "Backup and restore of a repository").
  After backup, you must follow the instructions for upgrading on the help site page [Qlik NPrinting upgrade](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/May2023/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Qlik-NPrinting-upgrades-updates-uninstall.htm "Qlik NPrinting upgrade").

  #### Upgrade to November 2018 or newer

  If you are upgrading to May 2023 SR5 from September 2018 SR2 or older you must:
  • Open port 4997 outbound on Qlik NPrinting Server and inbound on all Qlik NPrinting Engines.
  • Reinstall all your Qlik NPrinting Engines and provide a password for certificate exchange.
  • Open the Engine manager in the Web Console.
  • Open the detail page for each Engine and send the certificate after inserting the same password you used during the engine’s reinstallation.
  Qlik NPrinting Engines stay offline until the certificate exchange is performed. Older Engine versions cannot connect to a Qlik NPrinting May 2023 SR5 Server.

  The following release notes cover the versions of Qlik NPrinting released in February 2024 Service Release 3.

  ### Improvements

  #### SMTP connection retry configuration

  Jira issue ID: OP-96021

  Two new parameters have been added to the *scheduler.config* configuration file:

  + *max-mail-client-connection-attempts*: Specifies the maximum number of attempts to connect to the email server. The default value is 2.
  + *mail-client-connection-attempts-delay-ms*: Specifies the delay, in milliseconds, before retrying after a failed connection. The default value is 500 ms.

  To customize these parameters, you must uncomment them in the configuration file.

  Additionally, this security improvement introduces a breaking change to the email client: certificate validation no longer accepts untrusted self-signed certificates. To use untrusted self-signed certificates, you will need to disable validation in the SMTP configuration or convert the certificates to trusted (trusted root store).

  #### Third party libraries updated

  Jira issue ID: OP-96012, OP-96013
  The following third-party libraries have been updated and patched to the latest releases:

  + AngularJS
  + NHibernate
  + Bouncy Castle
  + PostgreSQL (Qlik NPrinting Repository)
  ### Resolved Defects

  #### Import tasks now ignore hidden cells

  Jira issue ID: QB-26555

  Import user tasks now ignore hidden cells in all worksheets of imported Excel files.

  ### Known issues and limitations

  The following issues and limitations were identified at release time. The list is not comprehensive; it lists all known major issues and limitations. We expect to have these issues fixed in future versions.

  #### Supported languages

  The following languages are supported:

  + English
  + French
  + German
  + Spanish
  + Brazilian Portuguese
  + Japanese
  + Italian
  + Simplified Chinese

  Other languages are not officially supported. There may be issues with other languages, particularly those with right-to-left script and non-Roman alphabets.

  #### Qlik Sense custom size sheets

  Qlik Sense custom size sheets are not supported. Custom size will not be maintained on export.
  Alternate states
  QlikView and Qlik Sense alternate states are not supported.

  #### Alternate states

  QlikView and Qlik Sense alternate states are not supported.

  #### Qlik NPrinting must be installed only on C: drives

  Jira issue ID: OP-6196
  Qlik NPrinting Server, Engine, and Designer can only be installed on C: drives. Any attempt to install them on a different drive will result in task failures.

  #### Image size settings are not respected when adding the same object twice

  Jira issue ID: OP-5831
  When you add the same object twice, using the Images node in Qlik NPrinting Designer, only the image size property of the first image is respected.

  #### QlikView On-Demand reports cannot be connected to Qlik Sense

  It is possible to select the “Enable” check box in On-Demand for reports using Qlik Sense app data. These reports are visible in the QlikView On-Demand menu of the QlikView On-Demand add-on. But if selected, they will not generate reports, and you will see an error message.

  #### Qlik NPrinting Designer crashes sometimes with zoomed screen settings

  If you experience random crashes when using Qlik NPrinting Designer, open your Windows Display Settings in the Control Panel and verify that Smaller – 100% (default) is selected. When settings of 125% or 150% are selected, Qlik NPrinting Designer may crash.

  #### On-Demand works in Chrome and Firefox, but not in Internet Explorer (11 or older) or Edge

  Jira issue ID: OP-5908
  In some cases, when you use Qlik NPrinting On-Demand in Internet Explorer 11 or Edge, the “origin” HTTP header is not generated. This results in the error message “REVEL\_CSRF: tokens mismatch”.
  The workaround is to install Qlik NPrinting On-Demand on a Microsoft IIS server hosting QlikView Access point or use a different web browser.

  #### Too many users and filters leads to Qlik NPrinting Designer errors

  Jira issue ID: OP-4940
  Qlik NPrinting Designer may be unable to open a report template if there are too many filters associated with a connection in the report's app. The following error message displays: “A task was canceled”.
  This typically happens when more than 4000 filters are using fields from a connection. Sometimes, higher numbers can work. For example, 7000 filters have worked in some situations.
  The workaround is:
  1. Split the Qlik NPrinting app into separate apps.
  2. Split the connections (possibly by using multiple connections to the same documents in different apps).
  3. Split the filters across apps (so that the filter count per app is lower).

  #### Task fails with the error 'Exceeded maximum number of retries'

  Jira issue ID: OP-4839
  Some Qlik NPrinting tasks fail with the error message: “Exceeded maximum number of retries”. This is due to a performance issue in QlikView that appears when it exports large unfiltered files to Excel.

  #### Verify connection freezes during “Initializing…” status

  Jira issue ID: OP-5278
  In some rare circumstances, pressing the Verify connection button will cause the screen to freeze on the “Initializing…” status and the spinning wheel cursor. This happens when a Qlik NPrinting Engine goes offline and Verify connection is pressed before the Qlik NPrinting Scheduler is aware that it is offline. It can take up to 20 seconds before the Qlik NPrinting Scheduler determines the offline status of a Qlik NPrinting Engine.

  #### User filters are excluded from matching and object filters

  Jira issue ID: OP-5914
  When you:

  + Open Qlik NPrinting Designer
  + Import a report

  The filters associated with each user are not uploaded, or displayed, for performance reasons. Waiting for all filters for thousands of users to import would take a long time. In most cases, importing this information is unnecessary, because filters created for users often contain something like the user IDs. You can change this behavior and make all filters visible by uncommenting the line <!--<add key="include-user-filters" />--> in the webengine.config file.
  To make a specific filter visible in the lists, remove its association to all users, or create a new filter with the same fields and values not linked to any user.

  #### Cancelling an upgrade results in a corrupted environment

  Jira issue ID: OP-3986
  The rollback that follows a Qlik NPrinting Server or Engine upgrade cancellation may corrupt the related Qlik NPrinting installation. A rollback is triggered by errors or by clicking the cancel button during the upgrade execution. After a corruption caused by a rollback, services may be uninstalled or cannot be started.
  To restore a Qlik NPrinting Server to its original status:

  + Retrieve a recent backup
  + Uninstall Qlik NPrinting Server
  + Perform a clean installation of the same Qlik NPrinting Server of the backup
  + Restore the backup

  You should always create a backup before starting an update. In any case, a backup is automatically created in the folder "%ProgramData%\NPrinting" at the beginning of the upgrade process. To restore a Qlik NPrinting Engine to original status:

  + Uninstall Qlik NPrinting Engine
  + Perform a clean installation of Qlik NPrinting Engine
  #### Adding a title to a Sense object with Assistance on generates an error on preview or task

  Jira issue ID: OP-7560
  Add title functionality is not supported on Qlik Sense objects with Assistance mode enabled. The workaround to restore the Add title functionality is to disable Assistance mode for the chart in Qlik Sense. Then reload the metadata of the connection.

  #### Cannot export tables, columns, and cells from Qlik Sense objects made using chart suggestions

  Jira issue ID: OP-7568
  Qlik Sense objects made in Assistance mode cannot be used as tables, columns, or cells in Qlik NPrinting. To restore them, disable Assistance mode on the chart in Qlik Sense; then reload the metadata of the connection. Furthermore, if a Qlik Sense object made with Assistance mode is exported as a table, column, or cell using Qlik NPrinting APIs, the request will fail.

  #### Open Type Fonts (\*.otf) are not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-7165
  Open Type Fonts (\*.otf) are not supported in PixelPerfect templates. Generated reports will use a different font, and not look as expected.

  #### Qlik Sense tables with conditionally shown columns have limited functionality

  Jira issue ID: OP-7747
  The following functionalities are not supported for Qlik Sense tables that have a "Show column if" condition set on one or more of their columns: levels, single column export, and keep source formats.

  #### Qlik Sense On-Demand reports with selections on calculated dimensions fails

  Jira issue ID: OP-8382
  Qlik Sense On-Demand reports with selections applied on calculated dimensions will fail. However, you can apply selections on dimensions based on Qlik Sense fields. The workaround is to move the formula to the load script and use the calculated fields to apply selections to your On-Demand reports.

  #### Qlik Sense histograms cannot be add into the Tables node

  Jira issue ID: OP-8985
  Due to the internal way of exporting Qlik Sense histograms, you cannot add them to the Qlik NPrinting Designer Tables node. If you add a Qlik Sense histogram to the Tables node, you will not receive any errors or warning messages, but the exported data will be wrong.

  #### QlikEntities limitation with Qlik Sense entities

  Jira issue ID: OP-8921
  QlikEntity reports support Qlik Sense objects with the following limitations:

  + Containers are not supported, but you can use all the objects that are inside containers.
  + Qlik Sense sheets can be added to QlikEntity reports and exported as images. The "Extend Sheet" feature does not work.
  + Export in PDF and TIFF is not supported.
  #### Embedding Excel worksheets into PowerPoint templates is not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-9087
  You cannot embed an Excel worksheet in a PowerPoint report template. This will cause a Qlik NPrinting Designer crash. The workarounds are to insert the Excel worksheet without using the Qlik NPrinting Designer:

  + Create a .pptx file by using PowerPoint without involving the Qlik NPrinting Designer. Insert the Excel worksheet and save the .pptx. Then use the .pptx file as a report template.
  + If you have already created the PowerPoint template, export it, open the .zip file generated by Qlik NPrinting and double-click the .pptx file inside. Insert the Excel worksheet, save the resulting PowerPoint and overwrite the exiting Qlik NPrinting template by uploading the updated .zip.
  #### Qlik Sense dynamic views limitations

  Jira issue ID: OP-9067
  Dynamic views is a new Qlik Sense feature starting from June 2020.
  If you connect Qlik NPrinting to a Qlik Sense app that contains a chart used to generate dynamic views, the chart and the containing sheet are excluded from the Qlik NPrinting connection cache and cannot be used in reports.
  You can connect Qlik NPrinting to a Qlik Sense app containing dynamic views. However, after a dynamic view refresh, the connection will stop working.

  #### Reports size limit

  Jira issue ID: OP-9628
  Starting from November 2020, RabbitMQ Server (deployed as Qlik NPrinting Messaging Service) has been updated to version 3.8.3. It has an internal limit, not configurable, about messages size of 512MB. Previous limit was 2GB. As consequence, is not possible to generate Qlik NPrinting reports bigger than 512MB.

  #### Excel print area with more than one range

  Jira issue ID: OP-9766
  Excel worksheet print areas can contain more than one range if the generation of the report does not expand the print area. If it expands, you will see an error: “Invalid Cell Name”. For example, the default setting of the Expand Range option in a Qlik NPrinting table causes the print area to change during report production, and an error is received.

  #### Searching in Cyrillic characters is case sensitive

  Jira issue ID: OP-9518
  Using Cyrillic characters in the Search form of the Qlik NPrinting user interface is case sensitive.

  #### The percentage "%" format is not kept in Excel reports

  Jira issue ID: OP-9995
  The percentage “%” format is not kept in Excel reports when using QlikView 12.50 (12.50.20000) or newer due to a QlikView issue. You can solve this by upgrading to QlikView May 2021 SR2 (12.60.20200) or newer.

  #### Run verification does not check if the installed version of QlikView Desktop supports QVF

  Jira issue ID: OP-95599

  If you start a Run Verification on a connection to a QlikView document in QVF format, Qlik NPrinting cannot confirm whether the QlikView Desktop version installed locally on each Qlik NPrinting Engine is compatible with QVF file format. The check mark next to "QlikView can open the document" may be green, even if a version of QlikView that does not support QVF is installed. This is because verification only checks file permissions. If the installed QlikView Desktop does not support QVF format, metadata generation will fail.

  #### QlikView objects with many fields with the same label are not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-95682

  QlikView objects with many different fields with exactly the same label are not supported. Duplicated labels cause an exception during the connection cache generation. To solve this issue, ensure that each field has a unique label.

  #### Images defined by URL in Qlik Sense tables are exported as text

  Jira issue ID: OP-95797

  Images linked by using URLs in Qlik Sense tables are exported as text. This affects only Qlik Sense connections. A workaround exists for PixelPerfect templates.

  #### Microsoft Sensitivity Labels Are Not Supported

  Jira issue ID: HLP-17139

  The sensitivity labels feature in Microsoft Office is not supported. If used, report generation and preview will fail with errors.

  As a workaround to the issue, block the Active Directory domain policy that pushes the sensitivity labels requirement to domain users.

  ### What's new in Qlik Web Connectors July 2024

  The following updates have been made to the Qlik Web Connectors Core and Web UI as well as the connectors listed.

  Core Engine

  + **POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE:** QWC now requires .NET Framework 4.8.1 to run (previously 4.8).

    The following requirements must be met to use .NET Framework 4.8.1:

    - **Windows Client versions:** Windows 11, Windows 10
    - **Windows Server versions:** Windows Server 2022
  + Updated Bootstrap to 5.3.3
  + Updated Font Awesome to 6.5.2
  + Updated react to 18.3.1
  + Updated react-dom to 18.3.1
  + Updated react-router-dom to 6.24.1
  + Updated axios to 1.7.2
  + Updated CsvHelper to 32.0.3
  + Updated jQuery 3.7.1

  Qlik Azure Storage Connector

  + Updated to use API version 2024-05-04

  Qlik Dropbox Connector

  + Added rootNamespaceId parameter to several tables to allow using 'root' requests to team spaces when applicable. This uses the Dropbox-API-Path-Root header.
  + Added UsersFeatures table to return a list of feature values if configured for the current account.
  + Added several new columns to the AccountInfo table.

  Qlik Facebook Insights Connector

  + POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE: Updated to Facebook API v20.0

  Qlik FTP/SFTP Connector

  + Updated to RebEx R7.0.8943

  Qlik Google Ad Manager Connector

  + Upgraded API from v202311 of v202405. See Google release notes [here](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/rel_notes#v202402) and [here](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/rel_notes#v202405) for changes.

  Qlik Google Ads Connector

  + Upgraded API from v15 of v17. See Google release notes [here](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/diff-tool/v16/versus-v15/diff)  and [here](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/diff-tool/v17/versus-v16/diff)  for changes.

  Qlik Google Calendar Connector

  + Added eventTypes parameter and eventType column to the Events table.

  Qlik JIRA Connector

  + Fixed incorrect error when unsupported table specified.

  Qlik MailChimp Connector V2

  + Fixed incorrect error when unsupported table specified.

  Qlik Mailbox IMAP Connector

  + Updated to RebEx R7.0.8943

  Qlik OData Connector

  + Added BasicPreEmptive option to send credentials immediately.
  + Fix to pick up [@odata](https://community.qlik.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/149497).context or @context.

  Qlik SMTP Connector

  + Updated to RebEx R7.0.8943

  Qlik Strava Connector

  + Increased SegmentEfforts table page size from 30 to 200. Note, this implementation does not use paging as the API currently returns duplicate data.

  Qlik SugarCRM Connector

  + Fixed incorrect error when unsupported table specified.
  ### Deprecated Connectors

  When upgrading connectors to the latest APIs, unfortunately the changes can be so extensive that we are unable to modify the existing connector. When this happens we will create a new version of the connector and put the existing one into a ‘Deprecated’ state. This means that at some point in the future it will no longer be available and after entering the deprecated status, it will no longer be updated. The date is normally determined by the underlying API which will often have its own expiry date, after which the connector using it will no longer work.

  You can see connectors affected under the Deprecated tab in Qlik Web Connectors. Three connectors are noted as deprecated in this release:

  + Qlik AYLIEN News Connector V2
  + Qlik Amazon S3 Connector
  + Qlik MeaningCloud Connector

  Two connectors are removed in this release, after being noted as deprecated since previous release:

  + Qlik Google Analytics Connector
  + Qlik Twitter Connector
  ### Known issues and limitations

  IP v6 addresses are not supported when you enter an IP v6 address for the purpose of white listing.

  Load Balancing is not supported.

  ### System requirements notes

  Qlik Web Connectors requires .NET Framework 4.8.1.

  The following release notes cover the versions of Qlik NPrinting released in February 2024 Service Release 2.

  ### Improvements

  #### Qlik Sense May 2024 is supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-96006

  Qlik Sense May 2024 is supported.

  #### QlikView May 2024 is supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-96011

  QlikView May 2024 is supported.

  ### Resolved Defects

  #### Error installing the On-Demand add-on with IIS as the web server on QlikView May 2024 (12.90)

  Jira issue ID: QV-25303

  Installation of the On-Demand add-on on a QlikView May 2024 (12.90) with IIS as the web server failed.

  #### Incorrect HTML output from Microsoft Word templates

  Jira issue ID: OP-96014

  Reports generated in HTML format from Microsoft Word templates resulted in a compressed file containing only font and image files. This issue affected only Qlik NPrinting February 2024 Initial Release (IR) and Service Release 1 (SR1). Other template types and Word outputs were generated correctly.

  #### Japanese error message after password failure was confusing

  Jira issue ID: OP-95990

  Japanese error messages when resetting the password have been improved and are now easier to be understand.

  #### Wrong column sizes in PowerPoint reports

  Jira issue ID: OP-95997

  When a table tag was utilized with the **Keep Source Formats** property set to true, the column widths match those of the cell containing the table tag, rather than the widths of the source table's columns.

  ### Known issues and limitations

  The following issues and limitations were identified at release time. The list is not comprehensive; it lists all known major issues and limitations. We expect to have these issues fixed in future versions.

  #### Supported languages

  The following languages are supported:

  + English
  + French
  + German
  + Spanish
  + Brazilian Portuguese
  + Japanese
  + Italian
  + Simplified Chinese

  Other languages are not officially supported. There may be issues with other languages, particularly those with right-to-left script and non-Roman alphabets.

  #### Qlik Sense custom size sheets

  Qlik Sense custom size sheets are not supported. Custom size will not be maintained on export.
  Alternate states
  QlikView and Qlik Sense alternate states are not supported.

  #### Alternate states

  QlikView and Qlik Sense alternate states are not supported.

  #### Qlik NPrinting must be installed only on C: drives

  Jira issue ID: OP-6196
  Qlik NPrinting Server, Engine, and Designer can only be installed on C: drives. Any attempt to install them on a different drive will result in task failures.

  #### Image size settings are not respected when adding the same object twice

  Jira issue ID: OP-5831
  When you add the same object twice, using the Images node in Qlik NPrinting Designer, only the image size property of the first image is respected.

  #### QlikView On-Demand reports cannot be connected to Qlik Sense

  It is possible to select the “Enable” check box in On-Demand for reports using Qlik Sense app data. These reports are visible in the QlikView On-Demand menu of the QlikView On-Demand add-on. But if selected, they will not generate reports, and you will see an error message.

  #### Qlik NPrinting Designer crashes sometimes with zoomed screen settings

  If you experience random crashes when using Qlik NPrinting Designer, open your Windows Display Settings in the Control Panel and verify that Smaller – 100% (default) is selected. When settings of 125% or 150% are selected, Qlik NPrinting Designer may crash.

  #### On-Demand works in Chrome and Firefox, but not in Internet Explorer (11 or older) or Edge

  Jira issue ID: OP-5908
  In some cases, when you use Qlik NPrinting On-Demand in Internet Explorer 11 or Edge, the “origin” HTTP header is not generated. This results in the error message “REVEL\_CSRF: tokens mismatch”.
  The workaround is to install Qlik NPrinting On-Demand on a Microsoft IIS server hosting QlikView Access point or use a different web browser.

  #### Too many users and filters leads to Qlik NPrinting Designer errors

  Jira issue ID: OP-4940
  Qlik NPrinting Designer may be unable to open a report template if there are too many filters associated with a connection in the report's app. The following error message displays: “A task was canceled”.
  This typically happens when more than 4000 filters are using fields from a connection. Sometimes, higher numbers can work. For example, 7000 filters have worked in some situations.
  The workaround is:
  1. Split the Qlik NPrinting app into separate apps.
  2. Split the connections (possibly by using multiple connections to the same documents in different apps).
  3. Split the filters across apps (so that the filter count per app is lower).

  #### Task fails with the error 'Exceeded maximum number of retries'

  Jira issue ID: OP-4839
  Some Qlik NPrinting tasks fail with the error message: “Exceeded maximum number of retries”. This is due to a performance issue in QlikView that appears when it exports large unfiltered files to Excel.

  #### Verify connection freezes during “Initializing…” status

  Jira issue ID: OP-5278
  In some rare circumstances, pressing the Verify connection button will cause the screen to freeze on the “Initializing…” status and the spinning wheel cursor. This happens when a Qlik NPrinting Engine goes offline and Verify connection is pressed before the Qlik NPrinting Scheduler is aware that it is offline. It can take up to 20 seconds before the Qlik NPrinting Scheduler determines the offline status of a Qlik NPrinting Engine.

  #### User filters are excluded from matching and object filters

  Jira issue ID: OP-5914
  When you:

  + Open Qlik NPrinting Designer
  + Import a report

  The filters associated with each user are not uploaded, or displayed, for performance reasons. Waiting for all filters for thousands of users to import would take a long time. In most cases, importing this information is unnecessary, because filters created for users often contain something like the user IDs. You can change this behavior and make all filters visible by uncommenting the line <!--<add key="include-user-filters" />--> in the webengine.config file.
  To make a specific filter visible in the lists, remove its association to all users, or create a new filter with the same fields and values not linked to any user.

  #### Cancelling an upgrade results in a corrupted environment

  Jira issue ID: OP-3986
  The rollback that follows a Qlik NPrinting Server or Engine upgrade cancellation may corrupt the related Qlik NPrinting installation. A rollback is triggered by errors or by clicking the cancel button during the upgrade execution. After a corruption caused by a rollback, services may be uninstalled or cannot be started.
  To restore a Qlik NPrinting Server to its original status:

  + Retrieve a recent backup
  + Uninstall Qlik NPrinting Server
  + Perform a clean installation of the same Qlik NPrinting Server of the backup
  + Restore the backup

  You should always create a backup before starting an update. In any case, a backup is automatically created in the folder "%ProgramData%\NPrinting" at the beginning of the upgrade process. To restore a Qlik NPrinting Engine to original status:

  + Uninstall Qlik NPrinting Engine
  + Perform a clean installation of Qlik NPrinting Engine
  #### Adding a title to a Sense object with Assistance on generates an error on preview or task

  Jira issue ID: OP-7560
  Add title functionality is not supported on Qlik Sense objects with Assistance mode enabled. The workaround to restore the Add title functionality is to disable Assistance mode for the chart in Qlik Sense. Then reload the metadata of the connection.

  #### Cannot export tables, columns, and cells from Qlik Sense objects made using chart suggestions

  Jira issue ID: OP-7568
  Qlik Sense objects made in Assistance mode cannot be used as tables, columns, or cells in Qlik NPrinting. To restore them, disable Assistance mode on the chart in Qlik Sense; then reload the metadata of the connection. Furthermore, if a Qlik Sense object made with Assistance mode is exported as a table, column, or cell using Qlik NPrinting APIs, the request will fail.

  #### Open Type Fonts (\*.otf) are not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-7165
  Open Type Fonts (\*.otf) are not supported in PixelPerfect templates. Generated reports will use a different font, and not look as expected.

  #### Qlik Sense tables with conditionally shown columns have limited functionality

  Jira issue ID: OP-7747
  The following functionalities are not supported for Qlik Sense tables that have a "Show column if" condition set on one or more of their columns: levels, single column export, and keep source formats.

  #### Qlik Sense On-Demand reports with selections on calculated dimensions fails

  Jira issue ID: OP-8382
  Qlik Sense On-Demand reports with selections applied on calculated dimensions will fail. However, you can apply selections on dimensions based on Qlik Sense fields. The workaround is to move the formula to the load script and use the calculated fields to apply selections to your On-Demand reports.

  #### Qlik Sense histograms cannot be add into the Tables node

  Jira issue ID: OP-8985
  Due to the internal way of exporting Qlik Sense histograms, you cannot add them to the Qlik NPrinting Designer Tables node. If you add a Qlik Sense histogram to the Tables node, you will not receive any errors or warning messages, but the exported data will be wrong.

  #### QlikEntities limitation with Qlik Sense entities

  Jira issue ID: OP-8921
  QlikEntity reports support Qlik Sense objects with the following limitations:

  + Containers are not supported, but you can use all the objects that are inside containers.
  + Qlik Sense sheets can be added to QlikEntity reports and exported as images. The "Extend Sheet" feature does not work.
  + Export in PDF and TIFF is not supported.
  #### Embedding Excel worksheets into PowerPoint templates is not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-9087
  You cannot embed an Excel worksheet in a PowerPoint report template. This will cause a Qlik NPrinting Designer crash. The workarounds are to insert the Excel worksheet without using the Qlik NPrinting Designer:

  + Create a .pptx file by using PowerPoint without involving the Qlik NPrinting Designer. Insert the Excel worksheet and save the .pptx. Then use the .pptx file as a report template.
  + If you have already created the PowerPoint template, export it, open the .zip file generated by Qlik NPrinting and double-click the .pptx file inside. Insert the Excel worksheet, save the resulting PowerPoint and overwrite the exiting Qlik NPrinting template by uploading the updated .zip.
  #### Qlik Sense dynamic views limitations

  Jira issue ID: OP-9067
  Dynamic views is a new Qlik Sense feature starting from June 2020.
  If you connect Qlik NPrinting to a Qlik Sense app that contains a chart used to generate dynamic views, the chart and the containing sheet are excluded from the Qlik NPrinting connection cache and cannot be used in reports.
  You can connect Qlik NPrinting to a Qlik Sense app containing dynamic views. However, after a dynamic view refresh, the connection will stop working.

  #### Reports size limit

  Jira issue ID: OP-9628
  Starting from November 2020, RabbitMQ Server (deployed as Qlik NPrinting Messaging Service) has been updated to version 3.8.3. It has an internal limit, not configurable, about messages size of 512MB. Previous limit was 2GB. As consequence, is not possible to generate Qlik NPrinting reports bigger than 512MB.

  #### Excel print area with more than one range

  Jira issue ID: OP-9766
  Excel worksheet print areas can contain more than one range if the generation of the report does not expand the print area. If it expands, you will see an error: “Invalid Cell Name”. For example, the default setting of the Expand Range option in a Qlik NPrinting table causes the print area to change during report production, and an error is received.

  #### Searching in Cyrillic characters is case sensitive

  Jira issue ID: OP-9518
  Using Cyrillic characters in the Search form of the Qlik NPrinting user interface is case sensitive.

  #### The percentage "%" format is not kept in Excel reports

  Jira issue ID: OP-9995
  The percentage “%” format is not kept in Excel reports when using QlikView 12.50 (12.50.20000) or newer due to a QlikView issue. You can solve this by upgrading to QlikView May 2021 SR2 (12.60.20200) or newer.

  #### Run verification does not check if the installed version of QlikView Desktop supports QVF

  Jira issue ID: OP-95599

  If you start a Run Verification on a connection to a QlikView document in QVF format, Qlik NPrinting cannot confirm whether the QlikView Desktop version installed locally on each Qlik NPrinting Engine is compatible with QVF file format. The check mark next to "QlikView can open the document" may be green, even if a version of QlikView that does not support QVF is installed. This is because verification only checks file permissions. If the installed QlikView Desktop does not support QVF format, metadata generation will fail.

  #### QlikView objects with many fields with the same label are not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-95682

  QlikView objects with many different fields with exactly the same label are not supported. Duplicated labels cause an exception during the connection cache generation. To solve this issue, ensure that each field has a unique label.

  #### Images defined by URL in Qlik Sense tables are exported as text

  Jira issue ID: OP-95797

  Images linked by using URLs in Qlik Sense tables are exported as text. This affects only Qlik Sense connections. A workaround exists for PixelPerfect templates.

  If you have a version of Qlik NPrinting older than April 2018, you must upgrade to Qlik NPrinting April 2018 before you can upgrade to Qlik NPrinting February 2024 SR2.

  If you have a version of Qlik NPrinting older than 17.3, you must first upgrade to Qlik NPrinting 17.3. Then you
  must upgrade to a version from April 2018 to May 2021 SR4 before you can upgrade to Qlik NPrinting May
  2023 SR3.

  If you are upgrading from a version older than February 2018, all metadata caches (QlikView and Qlik Sense) will be marked as "not generated". This is due to a breaking change in the format of the metadata cache. All connection caches must be regenerated before you can edit a template or create a new connection.

  You must back up your data before you proceed. Data can become damaged if a problem occurs during the
  upgrade. If data is damaged, a backup is required to restore the repository. See: [Backup and restore of a](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/February2024/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Backup-restore.htm "Backup and restore of a repository")[repository](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/May2022/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Backup-restore.htm "Backup and restore of a repository").
  After backup, you must follow the instructions for upgrading on the help site page [Qlik NPrinting upgrade](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/February2024/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Qlik-NPrinting-upgrades-updates-uninstall.htm "Qlik NPrinting upgrade").

  #### Upgrade to November 2018 or newer

  If you are upgrading to February 2024 SR2 from September 2018 SR2 or older you must:
  • Open port 4997 outbound on Qlik NPrinting Server and inbound on all Qlik NPrinting Engines.
  • Reinstall all your Qlik NPrinting Engines and provide a password for certificate exchange.
  • Open the Engine manager in the Web Console.
  • Open the detail page for each Engine and send the certificate after inserting the same password you used during the engine’s reinstallation.
  Qlik NPrinting Engines stay offline until the certificate exchange is performed. Older Engine versions cannot connect to a Qlik NPrinting February 2024 SR2 Server.

  The following release notes cover the versions of Qlik NPrinting released in May 2023 Service Release 5.

  ### Improvements

  #### Qlik Sense May 2024 is supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-96006

  Qlik Sense May 2024 is supported.

  #### QlikView May 2024 is supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-96011

  QlikView May 2024 is supported.

  ### Resolved Defects

  #### Error installing the On-Demand add-on with IIS as the web server on QlikView May 2024 (12.90)

  Jira issue ID: QV-25303

  Installation of the On-Demand add-on on a QlikView May 2024 (12.90) with IIS as the web server failed.

  #### Japanese error message after password failure was confusing

  Jira issue ID: OP-95990

  Japanese error messages when resetting the password have been improved and are now easier to be understand.

  #### Wrong column sizes in PowerPoint reports

  Jira issue ID: OP-95997

  When a table tag was utilized with the **Keep Source Formats** property set to true, the column widths match those of the cell containing the table tag, rather than the widths of the source table's columns.

  ### Known issues and limitations

  The following issues and limitations were identified at release time. The list is not comprehensive; it lists all known major issues and limitations. We expect to have these issues fixed in future versions.

  #### Supported languages

  The following languages are supported:

  + English
  + French
  + German
  + Spanish
  + Brazilian Portuguese
  + Japanese
  + Italian
  + Simplified Chinese

  Other languages are not officially supported. There may be issues with other languages, particularly those with right-to-left script and non-Roman alphabets.

  #### Qlik Sense custom size sheets

  Qlik Sense custom size sheets are not supported. Custom size will not be maintained on export.
  Alternate states
  QlikView and Qlik Sense alternate states are not supported.

  #### Alternate states

  QlikView and Qlik Sense alternate states are not supported.

  #### Qlik NPrinting must be installed only on C: drives

  Jira issue ID: OP-6196
  Qlik NPrinting Server, Engine, and Designer can only be installed on C: drives. Any attempt to install them on a different drive will result in task failures.

  #### Image size settings are not respected when adding the same object twice

  Jira issue ID: OP-5831
  When you add the same object twice, using the Images node in Qlik NPrinting Designer, only the image size property of the first image is respected.

  #### QlikView On-Demand reports cannot be connected to Qlik Sense

  It is possible to select the “Enable” check box in On-Demand for reports using Qlik Sense app data. These reports are visible in the QlikView On-Demand menu of the QlikView On-Demand add-on. But if selected, they will not generate reports, and you will see an error message.

  #### Qlik NPrinting Designer crashes sometimes with zoomed screen settings

  If you experience random crashes when using Qlik NPrinting Designer, open your Windows Display Settings in the Control Panel and verify that Smaller – 100% (default) is selected. When settings of 125% or 150% are selected, Qlik NPrinting Designer may crash.

  #### On-Demand works in Chrome and Firefox, but not in Internet Explorer (11 or older) or Edge

  Jira issue ID: OP-5908
  In some cases, when you use Qlik NPrinting On-Demand in Internet Explorer 11 or Edge, the “origin” HTTP header is not generated. This results in the error message “REVEL\_CSRF: tokens mismatch”.
  The workaround is to install Qlik NPrinting On-Demand on a Microsoft IIS server hosting QlikView Access point or use a different web browser.

  #### Too many users and filters leads to Qlik NPrinting Designer errors

  Jira issue ID: OP-4940
  Qlik NPrinting Designer may be unable to open a report template if there are too many filters associated with a connection in the report's app. The following error message displays: “A task was canceled”.
  This typically happens when more than 4000 filters are using fields from a connection. Sometimes, higher numbers can work. For example, 7000 filters have worked in some situations.
  The workaround is:
  1. Split the Qlik NPrinting app into separate apps.
  2. Split the connections (possibly by using multiple connections to the same documents in different apps).
  3. Split the filters across apps (so that the filter count per app is lower).

  #### Task fails with the error 'Exceeded maximum number of retries'

  Jira issue ID: OP-4839
  Some Qlik NPrinting tasks fail with the error message: “Exceeded maximum number of retries”. This is due to a performance issue in QlikView that appears when it exports large unfiltered files to Excel.

  #### Verify connection freezes during “Initializing…” status

  Jira issue ID: OP-5278
  In some rare circumstances, pressing the Verify connection button will cause the screen to freeze on the “Initializing…” status and the spinning wheel cursor. This happens when a Qlik NPrinting Engine goes offline and Verify connection is pressed before the Qlik NPrinting Scheduler is aware that it is offline. It can take up to 20 seconds before the Qlik NPrinting Scheduler determines the offline status of a Qlik NPrinting Engine.

  #### User filters are excluded from matching and object filters

  Jira issue ID: OP-5914
  When you:

  + Open Qlik NPrinting Designer
  + Import a report

  The filters associated with each user are not uploaded, or displayed, for performance reasons. Waiting for all filters for thousands of users to import would take a long time. In most cases, importing this information is unnecessary, because filters created for users often contain something like the user IDs. You can change this behavior and make all filters visible by uncommenting the line <!--<add key="include-user-filters" />--> in the webengine.config file.
  To make a specific filter visible in the lists, remove its association to all users, or create a new filter with the same fields and values not linked to any user.

  #### Cancelling an upgrade results in a corrupted environment

  Jira issue ID: OP-3986
  The rollback that follows a Qlik NPrinting Server or Engine upgrade cancellation may corrupt the related Qlik NPrinting installation. A rollback is triggered by errors or by clicking the cancel button during the upgrade execution. After a corruption caused by a rollback, services may be uninstalled or cannot be started.
  To restore a Qlik NPrinting Server to its original status:

  + Retrieve a recent backup
  + Uninstall Qlik NPrinting Server
  + Perform a clean installation of the same Qlik NPrinting Server of the backup
  + Restore the backup

  You should always create a backup before starting an update. In any case, a backup is automatically created in the folder "%ProgramData%\NPrinting" at the beginning of the upgrade process. To restore a Qlik NPrinting Engine to original status:

  + Uninstall Qlik NPrinting Engine
  + Perform a clean installation of Qlik NPrinting Engine
  #### Adding a title to a Sense object with Assistance on generates an error on preview or task

  Jira issue ID: OP-7560
  Add title functionality is not supported on Qlik Sense objects with Assistance mode enabled. The workaround to restore the Add title functionality is to disable Assistance mode for the chart in Qlik Sense. Then reload the metadata of the connection.

  #### Cannot export tables, columns, and cells from Qlik Sense objects made using chart suggestions

  Jira issue ID: OP-7568
  Qlik Sense objects made in Assistance mode cannot be used as tables, columns, or cells in Qlik NPrinting. To restore them, disable Assistance mode on the chart in Qlik Sense; then reload the metadata of the connection. Furthermore, if a Qlik Sense object made with Assistance mode is exported as a table, column, or cell using Qlik NPrinting APIs, the request will fail.

  #### Open Type Fonts (\*.otf) are not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-7165
  Open Type Fonts (\*.otf) are not supported in PixelPerfect templates. Generated reports will use a different font, and not look as expected.

  #### Qlik Sense tables with conditionally shown columns have limited functionality

  Jira issue ID: OP-7747
  The following functionalities are not supported for Qlik Sense tables that have a "Show column if" condition set on one or more of their columns: levels, single column export, and keep source formats.

  #### Qlik Sense On-Demand reports with selections on calculated dimensions fails

  Jira issue ID: OP-8382
  Qlik Sense On-Demand reports with selections applied on calculated dimensions will fail. However, you can apply selections on dimensions based on Qlik Sense fields. The workaround is to move the formula to the load script and use the calculated fields to apply selections to your On-Demand reports.

  #### Qlik Sense histograms cannot be add into the Tables node

  Jira issue ID: OP-8985
  Due to the internal way of exporting Qlik Sense histograms, you cannot add them to the Qlik NPrinting Designer Tables node. If you add a Qlik Sense histogram to the Tables node, you will not receive any errors or warning messages, but the exported data will be wrong.

  #### QlikEntities limitation with Qlik Sense entities

  Jira issue ID: OP-8921
  QlikEntity reports support Qlik Sense objects with the following limitations:

  + Containers are not supported, but you can use all the objects that are inside containers.
  + Qlik Sense sheets can be added to QlikEntity reports and exported as images. The "Extend Sheet" feature does not work.
  + Export in PDF and TIFF is not supported.
  #### Embedding Excel worksheets into PowerPoint templates is not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-9087
  You cannot embed an Excel worksheet in a PowerPoint report template. This will cause a Qlik NPrinting Designer crash. The workarounds are to insert the Excel worksheet without using the Qlik NPrinting Designer:

  + Create a .pptx file by using PowerPoint without involving the Qlik NPrinting Designer. Insert the Excel worksheet and save the .pptx. Then use the .pptx file as a report template.
  + If you have already created the PowerPoint template, export it, open the .zip file generated by Qlik NPrinting and double-click the .pptx file inside. Insert the Excel worksheet, save the resulting PowerPoint and overwrite the exiting Qlik NPrinting template by uploading the updated .zip.
  #### Qlik Sense dynamic views limitations

  Jira issue ID: OP-9067
  Dynamic views is a new Qlik Sense feature starting from June 2020.
  If you connect Qlik NPrinting to a Qlik Sense app that contains a chart used to generate dynamic views, the chart and the containing sheet are excluded from the Qlik NPrinting connection cache and cannot be used in reports.
  You can connect Qlik NPrinting to a Qlik Sense app containing dynamic views. However, after a dynamic view refresh, the connection will stop working.

  #### Reports size limit

  Jira issue ID: OP-9628
  Starting from November 2020, RabbitMQ Server (deployed as Qlik NPrinting Messaging Service) has been updated to version 3.8.3. It has an internal limit, not configurable, about messages size of 512MB. Previous limit was 2GB. As consequence, is not possible to generate Qlik NPrinting reports bigger than 512MB.

  #### Excel print area with more than one range

  Jira issue ID: OP-9766
  Excel worksheet print areas can contain more than one range if the generation of the report does not expand the print area. If it expands, you will see an error: “Invalid Cell Name”. For example, the default setting of the Expand Range option in a Qlik NPrinting table causes the print area to change during report production, and an error is received.

  #### Searching in Cyrillic characters is case sensitive

  Jira issue ID: OP-9518
  Using Cyrillic characters in the Search form of the Qlik NPrinting user interface is case sensitive.

  #### The percentage "%" format is not kept in Excel reports

  Jira issue ID: OP-9995
  The percentage “%” format is not kept in Excel reports when using QlikView 12.50 (12.50.20000) or newer due to a QlikView issue. You can solve this by upgrading to QlikView May 2021 SR2 (12.60.20200) or newer.

  #### Run verification does not check if the installed version of QlikView Desktop supports QVF

  Jira issue ID: OP-95599

  If you start a Run Verification on a connection to a QlikView document in QVF format, Qlik NPrinting cannot confirm whether the QlikView Desktop version installed locally on each Qlik NPrinting Engine is compatible with QVF file format. The check mark next to "QlikView can open the document" may be green, even if a version of QlikView that does not support QVF is installed. This is because verification only checks file permissions. If the installed QlikView Desktop does not support QVF format, metadata generation will fail.

  #### QlikView objects with many fields with the same label are not supported

  Jira issue ID: OP-95682

  QlikView objects with many different fields with exactly the same label are not supported. Duplicated labels cause an exception during the connection cache generation. To solve this issue, ensure that each field has a unique label.

  #### Images defined by URL in Qlik Sense tables are exported as text

  Jira issue ID: OP-95797

  Images linked by using URLs in Qlik Sense tables are exported as text. This affects only Qlik Sense connections. A workaround exists for PixelPerfect templates.

  #### Microsoft Sensitivity Labels Are Not Supported

  Jira issue ID: HLP-17139

  The sensitivity labels feature in Microsoft Office is not supported. If used, report generation and preview will fail with errors.

  As a workaround to the issue, block the Active Directory domain policy that pushes the sensitivity labels requirement to domain users.

  If you have a version of Qlik NPrinting older than April 2018, you must upgrade to Qlik NPrinting April 2018 before you can upgrade to Qlik NPrinting May 2023 SR5.

  If you have a version of Qlik NPrinting older than 17.3, you must first upgrade to Qlik NPrinting 17.3. Then you
  must upgrade to a version from April 2018 to May 2021 SR4 before you can upgrade to Qlik NPrinting May
  2023 SR5.

  If you are upgrading from a version older than February 2018, all metadata caches (QlikView and Qlik Sense) will be marked as "not generated". This is due to a breaking change in the format of the metadata cache. All connection caches must be regenerated before you can edit a template or create a new connection.

  You must back up your data before you proceed. Data can become damaged if a problem occurs during the
  upgrade. If data is damaged, a backup is required to restore the repository. See: [Backup and restore of a](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/May2023/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Backup-restore.htm "Backup and restore of a repository")
  [repository](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/May2022/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Backup-restore.htm "Backup and restore of a repository").
  After backup, you must follow the instructions for upgrading on the help site page [Qlik NPrinting upgrade](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/nprinting/May2023/Content/NPrinting/DeployingQVNprinting/Qlik-NPrinting-upgrades-updates-uninstall.htm "Qlik NPrinting upgrade").

  #### Upgrade to November 2018 or newer

  If you are upgrading to May 2023 SR5 from September 2018 SR2 or older you must:
  • Open port 4997 outbound on Qlik NPrinting Server and inbound on all Qlik NPrinting Engines.
  • Reinstall all your Qlik NPrinting Engines and provide a password for certificate exchange.
  • Open the Engine manager in the Web Console.
  • Open the detail page for each Engine and send the certificate after inserting the same password you used during the engine’s reinstallation.
  Qlik NPrinting Engines stay offline until the certificate exchange is performed. Older Engine versions cannot connect to a Qlik NPrinting May 2023 SR4 Server.
