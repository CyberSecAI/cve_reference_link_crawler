# Overview

Authenticated Remote Code Execution via firmware upgrade function.

# Product and Version

| Product | Affected | Mitigated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nova 360 Cabinet | <= 1.3.0.0.7b102 | Beta1.3.0.1.0 |
| Titan 180 Premium | <= 1.3.0.0.6 | 1.3.0.0.9 |

# Description

The charger firmware is upgraded by providing a zip file, then `/ubi/local/apps/ocpp/ocpp` will service the actual process. The service doesn't have any validation/authentication check against provided archive. Authenticated user can upload the crafted archive to totally compromise the device (there are several ways to upgrade, including via web interface).
