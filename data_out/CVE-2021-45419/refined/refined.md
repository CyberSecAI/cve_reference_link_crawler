Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the `CVE-2021-45419.md` file:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper validation and authentication checks when processing firmware upgrade files. Specifically, the `/ubi/local/apps/ocpp/ocpp` service does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the provided archive (zip file).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Firmware Upgrade Process:** The firmware upgrade process allows arbitrary zip files to be uploaded without validation.
*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The `/ubi/local/apps/ocpp/ocpp` service doesn't perform checks on the upgrade archive, allowing an authenticated user to upload malicious content.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The lack of validation allows attackers to craft malicious archives that, when unpacked, can execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Device Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows a complete compromise of the affected charging devices.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can run arbitrary code, potentially gaining full control over the device's operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Firmware Upgrade Functionality:** The attack vector is the firmware upgrade functionality within the affected product.
*   **Web Interface or other methods:** The vulnerability can be exploited via the web interface or other methods of uploading firmware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the charging device.
*   **Ability to upload firmware:** The attacker must have access to the device's firmware update functionality.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **Nova 360 Cabinet:** Versions `<= 1.3.0.0.7b102` are affected. Mitigation is in version `Beta1.3.0.1.0`.
*   **Titan 180 Premium:** Versions `<= 1.3.0.0.6` are affected. Mitigation is in version `1.3.0.0.9`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The github content provides specific version information and also specifies the vulnerable component that the starcharge website does not.
*   The Github content specifies the vulnerable component as `/ubi/local/apps/ocpp/ocpp`
