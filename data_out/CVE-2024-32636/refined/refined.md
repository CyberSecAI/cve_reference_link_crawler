Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-32636:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read that occurs while parsing specially crafted X\_T files. Specifically, the read occurs past the end of an allocated structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The application reads memory beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution within the context of the current process by exploiting the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious X\_T File:** The attack involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted X\_T file with the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious X\_T file to the victim. This usually involves social engineering, or by using a file-sharing or web-based attack.
*   User interaction is required since the user has to open the file with the vulnerable application.

**Affected Products:**

The vulnerability affects the following products when processing specially crafted X_T files:
*   JT2Go (All versions prior to V2312.0005)
*   Teamcenter Visualization (Versions prior to V14.2.0.12, V14.3.0.10 and V2312.0005)
