- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could perform actions they are not supposed to be able to, which can vary depending on the specific vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via a function lacking proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber (an unprivileged user role).
