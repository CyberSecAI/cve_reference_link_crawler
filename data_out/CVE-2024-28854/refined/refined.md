{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `tls-listener` crate, in its default configuration, limits the number of concurrent TLS handshakes, while continuing to accept new TCP connections. This makes it vulnerable to a slow loris attack where a malicious actor can open numerous TCP connections, but never complete the TLS handshake, exhausting the available resources and preventing legitimate connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The default configuration of `tls-listener` limits the number of concurrent TLS handshakes.",
      "The library continues to accept new TCP connections even when the maximum number of handshakes are ongoing.",
      "Lack of proper timeout mechanism for incomplete connections"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting the server's resources, preventing new legitimate connections from being established.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based, where a remote attacker establishes multiple TCP connections and deliberately avoids completing the TLS handshake.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections with the vulnerable server. No authentication or special privileges are required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by increasing the maximum number of concurrent handshakes allowed using the `Builder::max_handshakes` method, or setting up reverse proxies or load balancers."
