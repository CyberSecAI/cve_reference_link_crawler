# wasmCloud actors without signed capabilities can receive unauthorized invocations

Moderate

[brooksmtownsend](/brooksmtownsend)
published
GHSA-2cmx-rr54-88g5
Jan 21, 2022

## Package

host\_core
(wasmcloud)

## Affected versions

< 0.52.2

## Patched versions

>0.52.2

## Description

### Impact

wasmCloud actors are WebAssembly modules that require signed capability claims to declare what resources it is allowed to access at runtime. The wasmCloud host runtime provides secure access to these capabilities in two directions: actors receive invocations from capability providers and capability providers can receive invocations from actors.

This vulnerability concerns capability providers invoking actors. Actors are normally required to declare their capabilities for inbound invocations, but with this vulnerability actor capability claims are not verified upon receiving invocations. This compromises the security model for actors as they can receive unauthorized invocations from linked capability providers.

### Patches

These problems have been patched in versions `0.52.2` and greater.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround and we recommend all users upgrade to an unaffected version as soon as possible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
