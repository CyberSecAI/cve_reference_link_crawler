# `GetRepositoryByName`, `DeleteRepositoryByName` and `GetArtifactByName` allow access of arbitrary repositories in Minder by any authenticated user

## Affected versions

## Description

### Summary

A Minder user can use the endpoints listed in the issue title to access any repository in the DB, irrespective of who owns the repo and any permissions that user may have.

### Details

<https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/e88e4b286e4bc04c03b0332a77961f085e1aa77f/database/query/repositories.sql#L22-L23>

<https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/a115c8524fbd582b2b277eaadce024bebbded508/internal/controlplane/handlers_repositories.go#L277-L278>

The DB query used here checks by repo owner, repo name and provider name (which is always "github"). These query values are not distinct for the particular user - as long as the user has valid credentials and a provider, they can set the repo owner/name to any value they want and the server will return information on this repo.

`DeleteRepositoryByName` uses the same query and I have been able to delete another user's repo using this technique.

The `GetArtifactByName` endpoint also uses this DB query. I have not reproduced the behaviour with this endpoint due to a lack of a suitable test case, but I do not see anything in the implementation of the endpoint to prevent it being exploited.

### PoC

Setup:

1. Fresh provider/project on the production minder instance which is owned by me.
2. A repo registered by another user (in this case, Ozz)

```
# show my identity
$ minder auth whoami
No config file present, using default values.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
