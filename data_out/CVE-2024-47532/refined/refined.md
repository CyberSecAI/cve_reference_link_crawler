Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `RestrictedPython` handles `AttributeError` exceptions and its interaction with the `string` module. Specifically, the `AttributeError` object was exposing a reference to the underlying object that caused the exception via `AttributeError.obj`, potentially leaking internal information. Additionally, the `string` module was being exposed in a way that could be leveraged for unintended access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage via `AttributeError.obj`:** The `AttributeError` exception object contained a reference to the object on which the attribute access failed (`e.obj = self`). This could be used to access protected or sensitive information.
*   **Unrestricted Access to `string` module:** The `string` module, when exposed without proper restriction, could be exploited to gain access to more of the underlying Python environment than intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially gain access to protected (and potentially sensitive) information by:

1.  Triggering an `AttributeError` in a restricted environment.
2.  Accessing the `obj` attribute of the `AttributeError` object.
3.  Leveraging the leaked object reference and the available methods in the `string` module or related objects to gain additional information or perform unauthorized operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   By crafting malicious input that triggers an `AttributeError` within the restricted environment.
*   By leveraging the unrestricted access to the `string` module in the restricted context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code or control the input within a `RestrictedPython` environment that is vulnerable (versions < 7.3).
*   The attacker must be able to access or interact with the `string` module, or cause an `AttributeError` to occur on a `_AttributeDelegator` object.

**Additional Details from the Patch:**

The fix implemented in commit `d701cc36cccac36b21fa200f1f2d1945a9a215e6` addresses the vulnerability by:

*   Modifying the `_AttributeDelegator.__getattr__` method to no longer set the `obj` attribute on `AttributeError`.
*   Restricting access to the `string` module by providing only a restricted view of it (as an `_AttributeDelegator` object) rather than the module itself.

This ensures that the `AttributeError` does not leak the object reference, and direct access to the `string` module is no longer possible.
