Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation on user-supplied URLs within the webhook alert feature of Canarytokens. When a user creates a Canarytoken and chooses to receive alerts via webhook, the system makes a test request to the provided URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary weakness is the absence of safety checks on the user-provided webhook URL. This allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not validate or sanitize the webhook URL before making the test request, creating the condition for SSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Internal Port Scanning:** An attacker could leverage the blind SSRF to scan and map open ports on IPs within the Canarytokens.org infrastructure (internal reconnaissance).
-  Although the response content from the SSRF request is not shown to the user, the successful exploitation of the SSRF reveals the presence of internal services/ports.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker would need to create a Canarytoken and specify a malicious URL within the webhook alert feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be a user able to create a Canarytoken. No other special position or advanced capabilities are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as "Blind" because the attacker does not receive the content of the response from the server's request. The attacker is only notified whether an error occurred when the test request was made.
- The issue has been patched in Canarytokens.org, and self-hosted users are advised to update their Docker images to the latest version (or a version after `sha-097d91a`).
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Low".
