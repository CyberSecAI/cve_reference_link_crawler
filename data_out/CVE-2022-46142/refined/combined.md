GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM RM1224 is a 4G ROUTER for wireless IP-communication from Ethernet based devices
via LTE(4G)- mobile radio.

SCALANCE M-800, MUM-800 and S615 as well as the RUGGEDCOM RM1224 are industrial routers.

SCALANCE SC-600 devices are used to protect trusted industrial networks from untrusted networks.
They allow ﬁltering incoming and outgoing network connections in different ways.

SCALANCE W-1700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11ac standard.
They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on the
operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

SCALANCE W-700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11ax or 802.11n
standard. They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on
the operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-34821

By injecting code to speciﬁc conﬁguration options for OpenVPN, an attacker could execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.6
CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code (’Code Injection’)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-46140

Affected devices use a weak encryption scheme to encrypt the debug zip ﬁle. This could allow an
authenticated attacker to decrypt the contents of the ﬁle and retrieve debug information about the
system.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

6.5
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

Vulnerability CVE-2022-46142

Affected devices store the CLI user passwords encrypted in ﬂash memory. Attackers with physical
access to the device could retrieve the ﬁle and decrypt the CLI user passwords.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

5.7
CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format

Vulnerability CVE-2022-46143

Affected devices do not check the TFTP blocksize correctly. This could allow an authenticated attacker
to read from an uninitialized buffer that potentially contains previously allocated data.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-46144

Affected devices do not properly process CLI commands after a user forcefully quitted the SSH
connection. This could allow an authenticated attacker to make the CLI via SSH or serial interface
irresponsive.
