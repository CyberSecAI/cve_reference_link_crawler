## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress File Upload < 4.24.8 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape certain parameters, which could allow unauthenticated users to execute stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Proof of Concept

- Add the upload form to an existing page/post
- Add a custom field (e.g., simple text) to submit additional data along with the uploaded file
- Submit the form as an unauthenticated user with the following payload in the text field
Message" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
- As an admin, go to the "Uploaded Files" section and click on "View details" to trigger the XSS

### Affects Plugins
