Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of **CVE-2024-2216**:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `docker-build-step` Plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint that implements a connection test.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on an HTTP endpoint.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The affected endpoint does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with `Overall/Read` permission can connect to an attacker-specified TCP or Unix socket URL.
- The plugin reconfigures itself using the connection test parameters provided by the attacker, impacting future build step executions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable HTTP endpoint.
- Due to the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker can trick a user into triggering the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permission within the Jenkins environment.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins instance, potentially through social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that there is no fix for this vulnerability at the time of the advisory publication.
- The advisory combines CVE-2024-2215 (CSRF) and CVE-2024-2216 (permission check) into one entry as they affect the same endpoint.
