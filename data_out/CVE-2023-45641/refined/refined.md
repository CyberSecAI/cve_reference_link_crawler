- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in administrator, performs actions on the vulnerable site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a higher-privileged user (admin) into unknowingly triggering a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
