The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48885.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `ice_gnss_tty_write` function within the Linux kernel's Intel ICE Ethernet driver. The function allocates memory for `cmd_buf`, then attempts to allocate memory for `write_buf`. If the allocation of `write_buf` fails, the function returns directly without freeing the previously allocated `cmd_buf`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The primary vulnerability is a memory leak, where allocated memory for `cmd_buf` is not released when allocation of `write_buf` fails, leading to a loss of available memory over time.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource exhaustion: Repeated triggering of the vulnerable code path could lead to exhaustion of available memory, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `ice_gnss_tty_write` function with parameters that cause `write_buf` allocation to fail, which could be achieved through the TTY interface used by the GNSS functionality of the ice driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `ice_gnss_tty_write` function with conditions that cause the `write_buf` allocation to fail. This likely involves interacting with the GNSS TTY interface provided by the affected driver.
