A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in comfyanonymous/comfyui version 0.2.2 and possibly earlier. The vulnerability occurs when an attacker uploads an HTML file containing a malicious XSS payload via the `/api/upload/image` endpoint. The payload is executed when the file is viewed through the `/view` API endpoint, leading to potential execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
