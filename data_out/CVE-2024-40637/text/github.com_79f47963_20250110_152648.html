# Implicit override for built-in materializations from installed packages

Moderate

[MichelleArk](/MichelleArk)
published
GHSA-p3f3-5ccg-83xq
Jul 16, 2024

## Package

dbt-core

## Affected versions

1.6, 1.7

## Patched versions

1.6.14, 1.7.14

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

When a user installs a [package](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages) in dbt, it has the ability to override macros, materializations, and other core components of dbt. This is by design, as it allows packages to extend and customize dbt's functionality. However, this also means that a malicious package could potentially override these components with harmful code.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Fixed on 1.8.0, and patched for 1.6.14 and 1.7.14 releases.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Previously, a materialization defined in a package that shared a name with one of the built-in materializations would be preferred by default, without user action which is surprising and makes it more difficult to detect the insecure behaviour. We've changed the default behaviour to require explicit overrides by users in `1.8.0`, and provided the ability to opt-out of built-in materialization overrides in 1.6 and 1.7 via the `flags.require_explicit_package_overrides_for_builtin_materializations: False` configuration in `dbt_project.yml`

Versions older than 1.6 are EOL.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
