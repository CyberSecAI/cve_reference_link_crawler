Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9868

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'url' parameter within the Age Gate Widget of the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'url' parameter of the Age Gate Widget. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database and executed when a user visits the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user accesses a page containing the malicious script, the script will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Stealing sensitive user data

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the 'url' parameter of the Age Gate Widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they need to be a registered user with the ability to create or edit content.
*   **Ability to manipulate plugin settings:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the Age Gate Widget settings to insert the malicious script in the 'url' parameter.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Plugin:** Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid & Carousel, Remote Arrows)
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 5.10.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.10.2.
*   The provided Trac link shows the code change made to address the issue. Specifically, the `esc_url()` function was added to sanitize the `redirect_link` URL, preventing XSS.
