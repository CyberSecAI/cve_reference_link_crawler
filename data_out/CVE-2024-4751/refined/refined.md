- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF checks on the settings update functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly changing the plugin's settings to values chosen by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits data to the plugin's settings update endpoint. The attacker then tricks an administrator into opening this HTML page while the administrator is logged into the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page. The attacker does not need prior access to the WordPress site.
