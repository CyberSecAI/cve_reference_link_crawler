Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-29866:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from uncontrolled resource consumption within the OPC UA .NET Standard Stack. Specifically, a malicious client can exploit this to trigger a stack overflow exception on a server that exposes an HTTPS endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption leading to a stack overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to the stack overflow exception, causing the server to crash or become unresponsive

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker can send malicious requests to a server that is running an affected version of the OPC UA .NET Standard Stack and exposes an HTTPS endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable server via the network. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability only affects servers with HTTPS endpoints.
- Workaround is to disable HTTPS endpoints.
- The issue has been addressed in versions 1.4.368.58 and later of the `OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard` and by commit `b4b4d91a9244e181e9f60f1654c830d469d8083a` and later of `OPCFoundation/UA-.NET-Legacy` codebases
