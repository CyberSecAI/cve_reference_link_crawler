{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "PIN code is transmitted to the peer device in plain text during cross-device authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the transmission of the PIN code in plaintext during cross-device authentication.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Network attackers can bypass the authentication process, reducing the difficulty of man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be in a network position to intercept the plaintext PIN code being transmitted during cross-device authentication."
