- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:**  The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` indicates:
    - **AV:L (Local):** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
    - **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low, requiring minimal effort.
    - **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to perform the attack.
    - **UI:R (User Interaction Required):** User interaction is required for the attack to succeed.
    - **S:U (Unchanged):** The security scope remains unchanged.
    - **C:H (High):** High impact on confidentiality.
    - **I:H (High):** High impact on integrity.
    - **A:H (High):** High impact on availability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access and requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. This likely involves the user opening a malicious file crafted by the attacker.
