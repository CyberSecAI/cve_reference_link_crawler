{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `validate-data` package is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when validating crafted invalid emails with long strings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `validate-data` package handles email validation. It becomes computationally expensive when handling long, invalid email strings, leading to a denial-of-service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack could cause the server to become unresponsive due to excessive resource consumption when validating long invalid strings for emails, leading to denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the email validation function within the vulnerable package when processing crafted strings.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests that cause the vulnerable code to process a long invalid email string. This could be through an API or some other interface that uses the validate-data package."
