Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Improper Access Control

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly restrict access to administrative functionalities, allowing users with low privileges (e.g., students) to gain administrative access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The application does not adequately verify the user's role before granting access to administrative dashboards and functions.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the URL to access administrative pages without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Low-privileged users can escalate their privileges to administrator level.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform actions intended for administrators, such as modifying exam settings, accessing sensitive data, or potentially disrupting the system.
*   **Data Breach:** Access to admin level functionalities could lead to exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by accessing the application through a web browser.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the URL to access admin functionalities directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privilege Account:** The attacker needs a valid account within the application with low privileges.
*   **Basic Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to manipulate URLs in a web browser.
*   **No Special Network Position:** The attack can be performed remotely.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is described as follows:
1. A student logs into the application with their student account.
2. The student manipulates the URL, changing `student-dashboard` to `admin-dashboard`.
