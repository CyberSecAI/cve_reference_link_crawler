The provided content relates to CVE-2024-9540.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `render` function in the `widgets/advanced/sina-modal-box.php` file of the Sina Extension for Elementor plugin, which allows rendering of Elementor templates. Specifically, the plugin was using `$frontend->get_builder_content( $template_id, true )` to retrieve the content of the template, without proper permission checks, which lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin does not properly check user permissions before rendering Elementor templates, leading to the exposure of sensitive data such as private, pending, and draft templates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with Contributor-level access (or higher) can extract sensitive Elementor template data. This data might contain confidential information, layout details, or content that was not intended to be publicly visible.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by making a request that triggers the render function in `widgets/advanced/sina-modal-box.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with Contributor-level access or higher on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to trigger the rendering of a template through the affected widget.

**Additional Details:**
The fix involves modifying the function call to `sina_get_templates_data($template_id, $frontend)`, which now checks if the user has 'edit_others_posts' capability or if the post status is 'publish' before rendering the content via `$frontend->get_builder_content()`
The patch also applies to multiple other widgets, including `sina-content-slider.php`, `sina-particle-layer.php`, `sina-accordion.php`, `sina-content-box.php`, and `sina-transform.php`
