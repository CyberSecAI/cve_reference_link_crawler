- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper link resolution during the installation process of Dell Dock Firmware and Dell Client Platform.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way the software handles symbolic links or similar mechanisms during installation, allowing for the deletion of arbitrary folders.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary folder deletion which can result in Privilege Escalation or Denial of Service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access to the system and requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability (e.g. running a malicious installer with a carefully crafted symlink).
