The provided content relates to CVE-2022-3024.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Simple Bitcoin Faucets" lacks authorization and CSRF protection in an AJAX action. This allows authenticated users to call the action and add/delete/edit bonds. Additionally, a lack of sanitization and escaping allows for stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unauthorised AJAX call
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of sanitization and escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's database, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users when they interact with the affected functionality, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious AJAX request and sending it to the vulnerable endpoint. This can be achieved via a simple form or a CSRF attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even a subscriber role is sufficient) or be able to trick an authenticated user into submitting a crafted form (CSRF).
