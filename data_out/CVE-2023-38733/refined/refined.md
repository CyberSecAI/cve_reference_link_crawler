Root cause of vulnerability:
The IBM Robotic Process Automation server stores database connection strings in installation logs.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Sensitive information disclosure. Specifically, database connection strings are exposed in installation logs.

Impact of exploitation:
Authenticated users can view sensitive information, specifically database connection strings, in the installation logs. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the database and further compromise of the system.

Attack vectors:
An authenticated user with access to the IBM Robotic Process Automation server can view the installation logs.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IBM Robotic Process Automation server to view the installation logs.
