### **[nblumhardt](/nblumhardt)** commented [Mar 20, 2024](#issue-2196714579) • edited Loading

| An escalation of privileges vulnerability exists in Seq versions 2022.1.7378 to 2024.1.11028 inclusive.  Servers with:   * Users in the "Project Owner" or "Organization Owner" roles, or * API keys carrying `Project` or `Organization`, but not `System` permissions,   are affected. These users, and those holding affected API keys, can use them to acquire `System` permissions.  Datalust recommends upgrading impacted instances to Seq [2024.1.11146](https://datalust.co/download) / `datalust/seq:2024.1.11146`, which is a highly-compatible in-place update for all versions in the affected range.  Servers running Seq 2023.4, which is within its support window, may alternatively upgrade to patch 2023.4.11151 (available via <https://datalust.co/download/all>, or the corresponding `datalust/seq` tag), which also addresses the issue.  The issue can also be worked around without upgrading, by:   * Changing users in the affected "Project Owner" and "Organization Owner" roles to "User (read/write)", and * Removing `Project` and `Organization` permissions from any API keys that carry them but do not also carry `System`.  ---   This issue was identified by Datalust during regular internal testing. |
