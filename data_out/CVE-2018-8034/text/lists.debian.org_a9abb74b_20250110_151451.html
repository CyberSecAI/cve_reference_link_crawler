Package        : tomcat8
Version        : 8.0.14-1+deb8u13
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1336 CVE-2018-8034

Two security issues have been discovered in the Tomcat servlet and JSP
engine.

CVE-2018-1336

  An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with
  supplementary characters can lead to an infinite loop in the decoder
  causing a Denial of Service.

CVE-2018-8034

  The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket client
  was missing. It is now enabled by default.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
8.0.14-1+deb8u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.
