## Installation

You can download and install Arconix Shortcodes using the built in WordPress plugin installer. If you download the plugin manually, make sure the files are uploaded to `/wp-content/plugins/arconix-shortcodes/`.

Activate Arconix-Shortcodes in the “Plugins” admin panel using the “Activate” link.

## FAQ

### What is compatibility mode?

Compatibility mode adds a prefix to all the plugin’s shortcodes. This was put into place to help avoid conflicts with other themes or plugins that used the same shortcode (like `[button]` or `[box]`)

### How do I enable compatibility mode?

Place the following code in your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```
define( 'ACS_COMPAT', true ); // Arconix Shortcodes Compatibility Mode

```

Now when adding a shortcode, just make sure they start `ac-` (i.e. `[ac-box]content[/ac-box]`

### Where can I find more information on how to use the shortcodes?

* Visit the plugin’s [Documentation](http://arcnx.co/aswiki) for explanations on all the shortcodes
* Tutorials on advanced plugin usage can be found at [Arconix Computers](http://arconixpc.com/tag/arconix-shortcodes)

### How can I collapse all the accordions?

While you can set the accordions to all collapse when the page is first loaded, the jQuery Tools script that powers these accordions does not support closing all the accordions once one has been opened.

### The Accordions/Tabs/Toggles isn’t working

While you can certainly start a thread in the [support forum](http://arcnx.co/ashelp), there are some troubleshooting steps you can take beforehand to help speed up the process.

1. Check to make sure the javascripts are loading correctly. Load the page with the malfunctioning shortcode in your browser and view your page’s source (usually CTRL + U). Look for jQuery, jQuery Tools and Arconix Shortcodes JS files there. If you don’t see jQuery Tools or the Arconix scripts at all (they’re somewhere near the bottom of the page), then your theme’s `footer.php` file is likely missing `<?php wp_footer(); ?>`, which is necessary for the operation of mine and many other plugins. If you’re unable or unwilling to resolve the issue yourself, contact the theme developer for assistance.
2. Check to make sure only one copy of jQuery is being loaded. Many times conflicts arise when themes or plugins load jQuery incorrectly, causing it to be loaded multiple times in multiple versions. In order to find the offending item, start by disabling your plugins one by one until you find the problem. If you’ve disabled all your plugins and the issue still persists, try switching to a different them, such as TwentyTen or TwentyTwelve to see if the problem is with your theme. Once you’ve found the problem, contact the developer for assistance getting the issue resolved.

### I have a problem or a bug

### [Arconix Toggles and Support](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/arconix-toggles-and-support/)

The Arconix Toggles really help to clean up the view of my fire district’s website. Even though the plugin has not yet been tested for compatibility with version 5.2.2 of WordPress, it seems to be working fine with various browsers and devices. Upendra has been very helpful in providing answers to my questions regarding customizing the css for the toggles and concerns about accessibility issues.
The documentation would be more helpful if it listed ways to customize the css of the shortcodes. I’ve been able to change the title color, background color, and margins but not the button colors. If there was better documentation and settings for changing features, I would rate the plugin 5 stars.

* Other – Removed the googlemap shortcode. There are other plugins available that are better for the task. If you are currently using my googlemap shortcode, please add code from [this link](https://gist.github.com/j-gardner/0f3adc735eb9ec7b5b39) to your theme’s `functions.php` file to add the shortcode back in

#### 0.9.5

* Maybe one of these days I’ll get this right. Thanks to @gasie for setting me straight. This plugin is now loading jquery-tools without the a bundled jQuery. As such, I’ve added a jQuery dependency to my script registration which will load the WordPress supplied version. All of that simply means jQuery conflicts with other properly-coded plugins should be a thing of the past.

#### 0.9.4

* accidently supplied the wrong version of jquery-tools script

#### 0.9.3

* update the jquery-tools script to the latest v1.2.6

#### 0.9.2

* Only load the javascript if a shortcode requires it to function
* Fix a typo in the four\_fiths column function

#### 0.9.1

* Added a load attribute to the accordions shortcode. This attribute allows the user to define which accordion is open by default when the page loads. The default is 1 and will load with the 1st accordion visible, but supports 0 (all accordions load closed) through 5 (the 5th accordion is open on load).

#### 0.9

* Initial Release
