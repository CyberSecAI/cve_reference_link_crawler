Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `box` shortcode of the Arconix Shortcodes plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user input when handling the attributes of the `box` shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database. These scripts then execute when a user views the page containing the injected shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user accesses these pages, the malicious scripts execute in the user's browser. This can lead to various attacks, including:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to gain unauthorized access.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the website's appearance or content.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating drive-by downloads.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive data stored in the browser or on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `box` shortcode within the Arconix Shortcodes plugin.
- Attackers can inject malicious code via shortcode attributes, such as `color`, `icon`, `icon_size`, `icon_other`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with **Contributor-level access or higher** to the WordPress site. This means they must have the ability to create or edit posts/pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.
- No user interaction is needed other than viewing the infected page for the XSS to execute.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Arconix Shortcodes plugin versions **<= 2.1.13**.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version **2.1.14**.
- The fix involved changing the sanitization from `sanitize_html_class` to `sanitize_text_field` for shortcode attributes and ensuring that the icon HTML is properly escaped
- The plugin's changelog specifically mentions the fix as "Authenticated Stored XSS vulnerability in box shortcode for Contributor+ roles".
