{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control, specifically an authentication bypass vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to the FortiAuthenticator not enforcing the 'Mandatory password and OTP' setting for unimported remote users during RADIUS login, allowing them to bypass the second factor of authentication.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the second factor of authentication and gain unauthorized access by using an unimported LDAP account.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a RADIUS login portal.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs a valid username from an unimported LDAP account."
