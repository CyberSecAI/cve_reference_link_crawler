- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating exit popups.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, allowing attackers to induce logged-in administrators to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify the exit popup settings of the plugin, potentially injecting malicious content or redirecting users to a malicious site. In the provided proof of concept, the attacker changes the custom content of the popup to "Hacked - Malicious code."
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, submits a request to the vulnerable plugin's settings page to modify the exit popup settings without the administrator's knowledge or consent. This is done through a CSRF attack, exploiting the lack of proper token verification.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious HTML page. The attacker does not need to have any privileges on the target WordPress site to carry out this attack.
