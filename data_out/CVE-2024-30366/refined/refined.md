  "summary": "The provided content details a use-after-free vulnerability in Foxit PDF Reader related to handling AcroForms, where a lack of object validation before operation leads to potential remote code execution.  Additionally, other Foxit security bulletins indicate that out-of-bounds read/write vulnerabilities when parsing certain U3D files or doc objects can also lead to remote code execution or information disclosure, which are also being attributed to CVE-2024-30366 by the provided Foxit Security Advisory."
