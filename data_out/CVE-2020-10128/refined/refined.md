- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CSV Excel Macro Injection
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to CSV Excel Macro injection in two separate locations: Collection and Featured Results.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious macros into CSV files, which could be executed when a user opens the file in Microsoft Excel or similar software.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user exports data from the application into a CSV file, and the CSV file contains injected formulas.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would likely require access to the SearchBlox application to add content containing malicious formulas to a collection or featured results.
