- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper memory initialization when parsing responses from AT+CMT commands in oFono.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uninitialized variable leading to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker who has gained the ability to execute code on the modem can disclose sensitive information. It can also be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code as root.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker who has gained code execution on the target modem can send crafted AT+CMT commands to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target modem.
