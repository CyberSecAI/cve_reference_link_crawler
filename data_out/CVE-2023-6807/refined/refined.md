- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the plugin's custom meta output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages, which will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies or redirecting users to malicious websites.
