Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-31714:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the Chitor-CMS application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Pre-authentication SQL Injection:** Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the `/edit_school.php?id=` endpoint. This endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection and does not require prior authentication to be exploited.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in `/edit_school.php`, before using it in SQL queries.
- **Vulnerable versions:** Chitor-CMS versions prior to 1.1.2 are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other application data.
- **Database Manipulation:** With successful SQL injection, an attacker could modify or delete existing data.
- **Complete database compromise:** The attacker could gain complete control of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `/edit_school.php` endpoint with a malicious `id` parameter containing SQL injection code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Chitor-CMS instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- **Exploit Availability:** A Python script that exploits this vulnerability is publicly available and provided in the exploit-db content.
- **Patch Information:** The vulnerability was patched on April 16, 2023, with commit `69d3442`. The patch includes the use of `mysqli_real_escape_string` to sanitize input data.
- **Vulnerable files:** The vulnerability was located in `/edit_school.php`, `/edit_school_class.php` and `sand_box.php`
- **Mitigation:** The provided code includes sanitizing input using `mysqli_real_escape_string` in the `Validate_input` function
