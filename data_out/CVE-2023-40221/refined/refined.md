- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The absence of input sanitization when loading certain sections of the web application. Specifically, when handling the MAIL_RCV parameter in the MAIL SERVER section.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Code injection vulnerability (CWE-94).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code when a legitimate user accesses the vulnerable section of the web application. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities including information theft, modification of device configuration, denial of service etc.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, through the web interface of the affected device. Specifically, by injecting malicious code via the MAIL_RCV parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated, but requires the victim to access the web section where the injected code is displayed in order to execute. The device must be network accessible.
