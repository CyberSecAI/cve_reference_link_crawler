- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `PasswordPlaceholderConfigurer` class in Apache Kylin uses a hardcoded key and IV for its encryption algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of a hardcoded key and IV in the encryption algorithm makes the encrypted passwords vulnerable to decryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can decrypt passwords that were encrypted using the vulnerable `PasswordPlaceholderConfigurer` class and stored in Kylin's configuration file. This would allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive data or systems.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs access to the configuration files where encrypted passwords are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the knowledge of the hardcoded key and IV and also have access to the Kylin configuration files containing the encrypted passwords.
