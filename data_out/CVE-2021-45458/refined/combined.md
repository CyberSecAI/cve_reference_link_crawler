Subject: CVE-2021-45458: Apache Kylin: Hardcoded credentials

Severity: moderate

Description:

Apache Kylin provides encryption classes PasswordPlaceholderConfigurer to help users encrypt their passwords. In the encryption algorithm used by this encryption class, the cipher is initialized with a hardcoded key and IV.  If users use class PasswordPlaceholderConfigurer to encrypt their password and configure it into kylin's configuration file, there is a risk that the password may be decrypted.
This issue affects Apache Kylin Apache Kylin 2 version 2.6.6 and prior versions; Apache Kylin 3 version 3.1.2 and prior versions; Apache Kylin 4 version 4.0.0 and prior versions.

Mitigation:

Users of Kylin 2.x & Kylin 3.x should upgrade to 3.1.3 or apply patch <https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1782>.
Users of Kylin 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.1 or apply patch <https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1781>.

After upgrading, users can configure the value of `kylin.security.encrypt.cipher.ivSpec` in kylin.properties for encryption algorithm, and then re-encrypt the password they need to encrypt.
