```text
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Academy LMS plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Broken Access Control. The plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functionalities, allowing unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.

Impact of exploitation: An unprivileged user (specifically a "student" according to the report) could potentially execute actions meant for users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies case by case but generally leads to unauthorized access and potentially modification of data or system functionalities that should be restricted.

Attack vectors: The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of proper access controls within the plugin's functions.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user, specifically a student in this case.
