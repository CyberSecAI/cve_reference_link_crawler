Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-31464:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from how XWiki handles password information when an object (xobject) containing it is deleted. Specifically, when a diff is generated between versions of a document where a user object was deleted, the password hash was being displayed in the diff instead of being obfuscated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Data Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is a data leak. The password hash, which should be kept secret, is exposed in the diff view.
- **Insufficient data sanitization/obfuscation:** The diff feature was not correctly obfuscating password data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:** An attacker who can view the diff of an edited document where a user xobject has been deleted, can obtain the user's password hash.
- **Password cracking:** The leaked hash can be subjected to cracking attempts, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the user's account.
- **Impact on extensions:** The vulnerability also affects any extension storing passwords in xobjects, depending on the page's rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Diff feature:** The vulnerability is triggered through the diff feature of the XWiki platform, specifically when viewing changes to document where a user object was deleted.
- **Direct Access**: Accessing the diff feature directly through the UI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges, specifically the ability to edit user pages, and the ability to view document history/diffs. Typically this requires Admin rights.
- **Page Edit rights:** Users with edit rights on the page containing the xobject could trigger the vulnerability, depending on the object.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by checking if the data comes from a password field.
- The provided github links show the commits that fixed the issue, which modify `XWikiDocument.java` and `BaseObject.java` to ensure the xclass reference is set even when the xobject is deleted, and to retrieve the xclass to avoid leaking the password.
- The issue was tracked under the JIRA ticket XWIKI-19948.
- The vulnerability was fixed in XWiki versions 14.10.19, 15.5.4 and 15.9-rc-1.
