# Password hash might be leaked by diff once the xobject holding them is deleted

Moderate

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-v782-xr4w-3vqx
Apr 10, 2024

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0-rc-1

## Patched versions

15.9-rc-1,14.10.19,15.5.4

## Description

### Impact

It is possible to access the hash of a password by using the diff feature of the history whenever the object storing the password is deleted. Using that vulnerability it's possible for an attacker to have access to the hash password of a user if they have rights to edit the users' page.

Now with the default right scheme in XWiki this vulnerability is normally prevented on user profiles, except by users with Admin rights. Note that this vulnerability also impacts any extensions that might use passwords stored in xobjects: for those usecases it depends on the right of those pages.

There is currently no way to be 100% sure that this vulnerability has been exploited, as an attacker with enough privilege could have deleted the revision where the xobject was deleted after rolling-back the deletion. But again, this operation requires high privileges on the target page (Admin right). A page with a user password xobject which have in its history a revision where the object has been deleted should be considered at risk and the password should be changed there.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.4 and 15.9-rc-1 by performing a better check before dislaying data of a diff, to ensure it's not coming from a password field.

### Workarounds

Admins should ensure that the user pages are properly protected: the edit right shouldn't be allowed for other users than Admin and owner of the profile (which is the default right).

Now there's not much workaround possible for a privileged user other than upgrading XWiki.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
