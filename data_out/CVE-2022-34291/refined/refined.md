- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack corruption while parsing PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119) leading to stack corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information leak in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted malicious PCB file in the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious file using the vulnerable software. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
