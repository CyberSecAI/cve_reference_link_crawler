SUMMARY

Siemens PADS Standard/Plus Viewer is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities that could
be triggered when the application reads ﬁles in PCB format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious
ﬁle with the affected application, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code
execution in the context of the current process

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

PADS Standard/Plus Viewer:
All versions

Currently no ﬁx is planned
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted PCB ﬁles in PADS Standard/Plus Viewer

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
