Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-45196:

**Verification:**

The provided content is a commit diff from a pull request that appears to be addressing an issue related to HTTP redirections in the context of database drivers, which is a common vulnerability vector, potentially related to CVE-2023-45196. The changes disable `follow_location` and `max_redirects` in the `stream_context_create` calls within the HTTP drivers for Elastic, ClickHouse, and SimpleDB. This is to prevent redirection, and therefore can be related to a vulnerability described in CVE-2023-45196.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTTP redirects within the database drivers of the Adminer tool. Specifically, the `file_get_contents` function, used to make HTTP requests, was configured to follow redirects, potentially leading to security issues if the server redirects to a malicious location.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Uncontrolled HTTP Redirections:** The drivers were vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) like attacks because they followed HTTP redirects without proper validation, allowing an attacker to potentially make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources, by controlling the target URL and causing the application to make requests on their behalf.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information from internal resources not meant to be exposed to the external world. This could include server configurations, internal services, or other confidential data.
    *  **Denial of Service:** If the attacker is able to redirect the application to an internal resource, they could also cause a denial of service by requesting a large resource or overwhelming the internal server
    *   **SSRF Attacks:** The server could be coerced to make arbitrary requests, potentially enabling further attacks within the internal network or to external systems.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Database Server:** An attacker controlling a database server could send a redirect response that the vulnerable client will follow, potentially targeting internal network resources.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Control over Database Server:** The attacker needs to have some control over the database server that the Adminer tool is connecting to, such that they can send a redirection response.

**Technical Details from the Diff:**

The commit disables the redirection by adding the following to `stream_context_create` in HTTP based drivers:

```
'follow_location' => 0,
'max_redirects' => 0,
```

This is done for the `elastic.inc.php`, `clickhouse.php`, and `simpledb.php` drivers. This change prevents `file_get_contents` from automatically following HTTP redirects, mitigating the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

The commit message "Disable redirections in HTTP based drivers" confirms the vulnerability and its fix.

The commit diff shows the changes made to `adminer/drivers/elastic.inc.php`, `plugins/drivers/clickhouse.php`, and `plugins/drivers/simpledb.php` files.

The code changes disable redirects in the `file_get_contents` function calls by setting `follow_location` and `max_redirects` to `0`.
