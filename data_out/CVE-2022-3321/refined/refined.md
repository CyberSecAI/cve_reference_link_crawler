- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect logic in the WARP iOS mobile client where enabling "Disable for cellular networks" and "Disable for Wi-Fi networks" simultaneously leads to the WARP client disconnecting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the client's handling of the two disable switches, causing it to bypass the Lock WARP switch feature when both are enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could bypass the Lock WARP switch feature, thereby bypassing the restrictions and policies enforced by the Zero Trust platform. This could lead to unauthorized network access and potentially expose data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the settings within the WARP iOS mobile client by simultaneously enabling "Disable for cellular networks" and "Disable for Wi-Fi networks".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the WARP iOS mobile client settings on a device where the Lock WARP switch is enabled.
