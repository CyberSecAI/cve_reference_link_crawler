{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of data within the 'awl_lg_settings_' attribute when processing the 'NPG' shortcode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "PHP Object Injection via deserialization of untrusted data"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject a PHP Object. While no POP chain exists within the plugin itself, the presence of a POP chain through another plugin or theme on the system could lead to arbitrary file deletion, retrieval of sensitive data, or execution of code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'NPG' shortcode and its 'awl_lg_settings_' attribute, which is decoded and unserialized.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor access or higher to exploit this vulnerability."
