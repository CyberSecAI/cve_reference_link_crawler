# Oracle Security Alert for CVE-2016-0636

## Oracle Security Alert for CVE-2016-0636

### Description

This Security Alert addresses CVE-2016-0636, a vulnerability affecting Java SE running in web browsers on desktops. This vulnerability is not applicable to Java deployments, typically in servers or standalone desktop applications, that load and run only trusted code. It also does not affect Oracle server-based software.

This vulnerability may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. To be successfully exploited, an unsuspecting user running an affected release in a browser will need to visit a malicious web page that leverages this vulnerability. Successful exploits can impact the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the user's system.

 **Due to the severity of this vulnerability and the public disclosure of technical details, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply the updates provided by this Security Alert as soon as possible.**

### Supported Products Affected

Oracle Java SE 7 Update 97, and 8 Update 73 and 74 for Windows, Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X are affected.

### Patch Availability Table and Risk Matrix

Java SE fixes in this Security Alert are cumulative; this latest update includes all fixes from previous Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Security Alert contains 1 new security fix for Oracle Java SE.  This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cve-2016-0636-verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

| CVE# | Component | Protocol | Sub­component | Remote Exploit without Auth.? | CVSS VERSION 2.0 RISK (see [Risk Matrix Definitions](/security-alerts/advisorymatrixglossary.html)) | | | | | | | Supported Versions Affected | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base Score | Access Vector | Access Complexity | Authen­tication | Confiden­tiality | Integrity | Avail­ability |
| CVE-2016-0636 | Java SE | Multiple | Hotspot | Yes | 9.3 | Network | Medium | None | Complete | Complete | Complete | Java SE: 7u97, 8u73, 8u74 | See Note 1 |

#### Notes:

1. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
