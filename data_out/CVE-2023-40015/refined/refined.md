The content is related to CVE-2023-40015.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Vyper compiler evaluates arguments in certain expressions from right to left instead of left to right, leading to unexpected behavior when side effects are involved.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect argument evaluation order: The compiler evaluates arguments from right to left for operations like `unsafe_add`, `unsafe_sub`, `unsafe_mul`, `unsafe_div`, `pow_mod256`, bitwise operations (`|`, `&`, `^`), and comparisons (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`),  `in`, `not in` (when lhs and rhs are enums). This is a deviation from the expected left-to-right evaluation.
- Side-effect reliance: The reversed order of evaluation can cause issues when one of the arguments produces side effects that other arguments depend on. Side-effect producing operations include: state modifying external/internal calls, raw_call, pop() on dynamic array, `create_minimal_proxy_to`, `create_copy_of`, `create_from_blueprint`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unexpected program behavior: The reversed evaluation order can lead to incorrect results, as shown in the provided examples. The value of a variable may be read before being modified when the developer expects otherwise.
- Potential for logic errors: Developers may write code that depends on a left-to-right evaluation order and introduce bugs when using the affected operations.
- Vulnerability to specific side-effect combinations: Exploitation is possible if the arguments of an affected operation have side effects that interact with each other.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting affected Vyper code: Attackers can manipulate arguments of the identified operations when side effects are involved, leading to unexpected behavior.
- Targeting smart contracts: This can be exploited in smart contracts written in Vyper.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to influence Vyper code: The attacker needs to be able to introduce or control the code in a smart contract or other Vyper application using the listed operations.
- Understanding of Vyper's evaluation order: The attacker needs to be aware of the reversed argument evaluation order and use it strategically to produce undesirable behavior.
