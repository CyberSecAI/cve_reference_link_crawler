Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of authentication for API requests in the Boodskap IoT Platform. The platform processes API requests even when they lack valid cookies or API keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authentication checks for API endpoints. This allows unauthenticated users to send requests that should require authorization.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The use of a user ID in the `/api/user/upsert/<userid>` endpoint without proper authorization checks leads to an insecure direct object reference vulnerability, where an attacker can directly target and modify other users' data using their ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can assign themselves an administrator role by crafting a request to the `/api/user/upsert/<userid>` endpoint.
*   **Unauthorized Modification of User Data:** An attacker can modify user profiles and other user-related data without authentication by sending requests to the same vulnerable endpoint, effectively bypassing access control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated API Request:** The attack vector is sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `/api/user/upsert/<userid>` endpoint without providing any authentication credentials, such as cookies or API keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Boodskap IoT Platform server.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable API endpoint `/api/user/upsert/<userid>` and the expected format for the request body.
*   **User ID:** The attacker needs to know at least one valid user id to target the request towards.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided example request demonstrates how an attacker can modify their user profile and assign themselves the "admin" role, by crafting the request body.
* The HTTP response shows that the request was successful ("code":"SUCCESS").
