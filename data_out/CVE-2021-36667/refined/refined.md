Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-36667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection flaw in the local HTTP server of the Druva inSync Mac client. This arises from an unsanitized call to the Python `os.system` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The application takes user-controlled input and uses it in a system call without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing execution of arbitrary operating system commands. Specifically, this occurs via the `filename` parameter in the `/copy_to_clipboard` endpoint of the local HTTP server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary OS command execution:** An attacker with local user-level privileges can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the system.
- **Non-root user context:** The commands are executed as the user running the inSync client, not as root. This limits the direct impact in comparison to some of the other vulnerabilities detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint of the local HTTP server of the inSync client.
- The attacker must have local access to the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user-level access:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the target macOS system.
- **Network access:** The attacker does not require network access from a remote location, but will need to be able to make HTTP requests on the local machine.
