**Overall Severity Classification:**High

# Summary

The inSync Client versions were susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow malicious users with user-level privileges to inject code and escalate privileges to root by chaining these flaws. These vulnerabilities cannot be exploited remotely and are exploitable only if the malicious user has user-level access to the device. Druva has released an inSync Client update that overcomes these vulnerabilities. Customers are strongly advised to upgrade to the latest version to remediate these vulnerabilities. See the [customer action required](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rKGAFLxpUJrRlGIMJ-ZFS4QLTjRK0CPVkcx3nCF98z0/edit#heading=h.fno1e8s6ihtu) section for more details.
