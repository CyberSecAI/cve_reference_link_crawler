## Nagios Success Stories

We’ve worked with thousands of incredible businesses of all sizes across the globe. Hear what they have to say.

[View Case Studies](https://www.nagios.com/case-studies/)

We are a telecommunications company and the leader in our region. Our monitoring goals were fulfilled with Nagios. We had all of our devices monitored 24/7 and were able to take advantage of all the reports and tools that Nagios has to offer.

![comteco](https://www.nagios.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/comteco.webp)

The biggest advantage of Nagios for us is its customizations. Nagios has simplified a very large job, allowed us to make the necessary customizations needed and provided us with a community that is a valuable resource when a new requirement comes up.

![IBM](https://www.nagios.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IBM_logo-1-1.svg)

Before monitoring, we couldn’t even spend the bulk of our time fighting fires; we were spending time finding them. Now, our system is nearly self-healing. Nagios is super easy to install and configure, runs on standard bash scripts, and allows us to automate anything.
