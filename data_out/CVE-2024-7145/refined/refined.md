Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The JetElements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion due to the lack of proper sanitization of the 'progress\_type' parameter. This allows for path traversal, where an attacker can specify file paths outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin improperly handles user-supplied input, specifically the 'progress_type' parameter, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to manipulate file paths to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient validation or sanitization of the 'progress_type' parameter enables the exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including and executing arbitrary PHP files, attackers can run malicious code on the server.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** Attackers can potentially bypass access controls by including files that should not be accessible.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive information by including files containing configuration details, credentials, or other private data.
*   **Full System Compromise:** In severe cases, this vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP request where the 'progress_type' parameter is supplied by the attacker.
*   **'progress_type' Parameter:** The specific vulnerable parameter is 'progress_type'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** Requires network access to the affected WordPress site.
