Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `name` parameter in the `contact_us_action.php` file. User-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `contact_us_action.php` file.
- Insufficient user input validation of the `name` parameter.
- Direct use of unsanitized user-provided input in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering or modification.
- Potential for comprehensive system control.
- Service interruption is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `name` parameter in the `contact_us_action.php` file using HTTP GET requests.
- Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious SQL code within the `name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `contact_us_action.php` file.
- No login or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) payload includes a time delay function (`SLEEP(5)`) to confirm the injection.
- Example payload:
  ```
  name=qqq' AND (SELECT 3011 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))KqxK) AND 'wOhI'='wOhI&subject=Order inquiry&email=qqq@qq.com&contact_number=1111111111&description=111
  ```
- SQLMap was used to confirm the vulnerability.

**Suggested Remediation:**
- Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
- Implement input validation and filtering.
- Minimize database user permissions.
- Conduct regular security audits.
