          "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetWizard1` and `formSetWizard2` functions within the D-Link DIR-605L 2.13B01 BETA firmware. The vulnerability is due to the `Var` variable receiving the `curTime` parameter from a POST request without proper bounds checking. The attacker controls the `curTime` input, leading to a buffer overflow via the `sprintf` function.",
