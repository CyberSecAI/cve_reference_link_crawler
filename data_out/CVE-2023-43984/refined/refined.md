- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of permissions control and predictable (or easily brute-forcable) filename for exported CSV files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor). The module does not properly restrict access to exported CSV files containing personal information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to and disclosure of personal information, such as name, surname, email, postal address, and phone number from the `ps_customer` table, leading to a GDPR violation.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction is required. An attacker can remotely access the exported CSV files if they know or can guess the file name.
