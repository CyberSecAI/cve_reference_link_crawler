Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-provided input parameters within certain FortiManager CLI commands. Specifically, parameters such as hostname, user, password, and target file name used in "diagnose" commands for exporting files (like umlog and fmwslog) via FTP/SFTP are not properly sanitized. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary operating system commands through unsanitized user inputs. This arises because the vulnerable commands pass user-supplied strings directly to the underlying OS shell for execution.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** Input parameters for the CLI commands are not sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious commands.
- **Insufficient process privileges:** The processes that handle user inputs and execute commands run with root privileges, which means injected commands execute with root privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  Since the processes run with root privileges, attackers gain root access to the device.
- **Full System Compromise:** Achieving an interactive shell as root grants an attacker complete control over the compromised system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **CLI Access:** The vulnerability is triggered through the FortiManager CLI.
- **Command Injection:** The attack is achieved by injecting shell commands into the vulnerable parameters of specific "diagnose" commands (e.g., when exporting files to FTP/SFTP).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account with "System Settings" privileges on the FortiManager device.
- **CLI Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the CLI interface of the FortiManager device.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable commands and parameters:** The attacker needs to know which CLI commands are vulnerable and which parameters are susceptible to injection.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by injecting a shell command into the `directory` parameter of a `diagnose system export umlog` command.
- The vulnerability exists in FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiPortal products.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" by the original reporting party and "High" by Fortinet.
- The fix involves upgrading to specific versions of FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiPortal to prevent the command injection.
- No workarounds are available.
