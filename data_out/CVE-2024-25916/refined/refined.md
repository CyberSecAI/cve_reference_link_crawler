- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The My Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a malicious actor to inject arbitrary JavaScript, potentially leading to redirects, advertisements, or other malicious HTML payloads that execute when users visit the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the vulnerable input fields or parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level privileges to inject the malicious script.
