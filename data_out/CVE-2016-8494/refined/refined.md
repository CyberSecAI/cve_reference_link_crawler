- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A webui administrator can create a new theme that executes arbitrary code on the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of user-supplied input when creating a theme, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Escalation of privilege, allowing an administrator with webui access to gain root access.
- **Attack vectors:** Through the webui interface by creating a malicious theme.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator access to the webui.
