**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20240701-0001
**Version:**
23.0

**Last updated:**
11/14/2024

**Status:**
Interim.

**CVEs:** CVE-2024-6387

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate OpenSSH. OpenSSH versions 8.5p1 prior to 9.8p1 are susceptible to a vulnerability referred to as regreSSHion which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

E-Series SANtricity OS Controller Software 11.x:

Affected only in version 11.80.1 when ssh login is enabled.

ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility:

Affected only in version 9.14.1.

ONTAP 9 (formerly Clustered Data ONTAP):

Theoretically exploitable in versions 9.11.1 and higher - the exploit has not been demonstrated on FreeBSD.

The default values for LoginGraceTime and MaxStartups are 30 seconds and 10:30:60 which reduce the chance of successful exploit.
