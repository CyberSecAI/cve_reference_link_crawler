I sent an email to secure@microsoft.com earlier today, and this is their official statement:

[PowerShell/Announcements#63](https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements/issues/63)

<https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-6387>

You can all sleep well now! :)

| Qualys currently states OpenSSH versions starting 8.5p1 and prior to 9.8p1 are vulnerable. For Windows: Detection relies on the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\sshd registry key to get the sshd.exe file path and checks for file version information from sshd.exe file.  We are also curious, if Windows is affected. |

| On the surface, it doesn't appear like the Windows builds *should* be affected given that the signal handlers were rewritten for Windows and don't call the function stated in the various disclosures. It would be good for someone with my recent time on the project from Microsoft to confirm my assertion though. Regardless, I suspect Microsoft may just patch it anyhow to avoid having the argument. |
