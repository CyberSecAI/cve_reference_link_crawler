Hi,

Regarding the race condition fixed in OpenSSH 9.8. A mitigation to
prevent exploitation of this bug is to disable the login grace timer
by setting LoginGraceTime=0 in sshd_config. This will however make
it much easier for an attacker to deny service to sshd.

Similarly, the much more minor keystroke timing bug can be avoided
by disabling the feature using ObscureKeystrokeTiming=0.

Some users will understandably prefer to patch their OpenSSH rather
than upgrade to the newest version, so here are minimal patches for
both problems.

1) Critical race condition in sshd

diff --git a/log.c b/log.c

2) Minor logic error in ObscureKeystrokeTiming
