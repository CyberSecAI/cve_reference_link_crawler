Hi Jacob, all,

A side note, just in case: only our exploit against Ubuntu 6.06.1 uses a
very long user name; our exploits against Debian 3.0r6 and Debian 12.5.0
simply use "nobody" (but it could be any existing user name).

There are various already-existing limits along the way, but the first
one is PACKET_MAX_SIZE, which limits the size of a packet (and hence the
strings it contains) to 256KB (and this is pre-authentication, so no
compression tricks are possible, here).

Thank you very much! With best regards,
