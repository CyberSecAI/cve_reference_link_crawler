# CVE-2024-6387: openssh[¶](#cve-2024-6387-openssh "Permanent link")

## Title[¶](#title "Permanent link")

CVE-2024-6387: regreSSHion: remote code execution (RCE) in OpenSSH server, exploitable at least on glibc-based Linux systems

## Summary[¶](#summary "Permanent link")

As [discovered by Qualys](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/01/3) and
[summarized by OpenSSH upstream](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/01/1):

A critical vulnerability in sshd(8) was present in Portable OpenSSH versions 8.5p1 [to] 9.7p1 (inclusive) that may allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

Successful exploitation has been demonstrated on 32-bit Linux/glibc systems with ASLR. Under lab conditions, the attack requires on average 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum the server will accept. Exploitation on 64-bit systems is believed to be possible but has not been demonstrated at this time. It's likely that these attacks will be improved upon.

Public disclosure date: July 1, 2024

## EL9[¶](#el9 "Permanent link")

* Fixed in version: `8.7p1-38.el9_4.security.0.5` available July 1, 2024

## EL8[¶](#el8 "Permanent link")

* Unaffected

## Mitigation[¶](#mitigation "Permanent link")

Set `LoginGraceTime 0` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and do a `systemctl restart sshd`.

A drawback of this mitigation is that it will make the SSH server more susceptible to denial of service attacks.
