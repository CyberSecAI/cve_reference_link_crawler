| The latest release of the hpn-ssh was based on OpenSSH 9.7, which is vulnerable to the regression of [CVE-2006-5051](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mq5h-r3rg-j9hg "CVE-2006-5051"), according to [the report](https://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt)  Thought it is worth raising concern about that problem, I wish I did not intervene in the normal process of development. |

| We've just been made aware of this but we already had started work on porting to 9.8. I hope to have a release ready by the end of the day but that may slip until tomorrow. |

| We've had to change plans and we have backported the fix from 9.8 to the 9.7 code base. This is available in master with the tag hpn-18.4.2.  The 9.8 port is taking longer than expected - especially with the packages. We thought this was the best move forward at this time. We will get to 9.8 as soon as we can but the US holiday will delay things. |

| Debian packages should now be available from [https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/rapier1](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home%3A/rapier1)  Functional Ubuntu packages should also be available from the launchpad PPA. |
