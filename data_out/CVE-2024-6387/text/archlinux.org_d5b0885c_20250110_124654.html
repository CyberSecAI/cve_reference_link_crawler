## The sshd service needs to be restarted after upgrading to openssh-9.8p1

July 1, 2024 - Robin Candau

After upgrading to `openssh-9.8p1`, the existing SSH daemon will be unable to accept new connections (see <https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/openssh/-/issues/5>).

When upgrading remote hosts, please make sure to restart the sshd service
using `systemctl try-restart sshd` right after upgrading.

We are evaluating the possibility to automatically apply a restart of the sshd service on upgrade in a future release of the openssh-9.8p1 package.
