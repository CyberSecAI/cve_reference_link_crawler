| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c0)  Marco Benatto    2024-06-27 15:50:11 UTC  ``` We discovered a vulnerability (a signal handler race condition) in OpenSSH's server (sshd): if a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously, but this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe (for example, syslog()).  On investigation, we realized that this vulnerability is in fact a regression of [CVE-2006-5051](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5051) ("Signal handler race condition in OpenSSH before 4.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), and possibly execute arbitrary code"), which was reported in 2006 by Mark Dowd.  This regression was introduced in October 2020 (OpenSSH 8.5p1) by commit 752250c ("revised log infrastructure for OpenSSH"), which accidentally removed an "#ifdef DO_LOG_SAFE_IN_SIGHAND" from sigdie(), a function that is directly called by sshd's SIGALRM handler.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-03 14:32:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:4312 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4312](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4312)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-05 21:32:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:4340 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4340](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4340)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-08 21:08:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2024:4389 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4389](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4389)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-17 00:38:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14  Via RHSA-2024:4479 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4479](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4479)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-17 01:35:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13  Via RHSA-2024:4484 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4484](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4484)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 17:50:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15  Via RHSA-2024:4474 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4474](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4474)   ```   [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c21)  lyly    2024-10-23 03:37:44 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` (In reply to errata-xmlrpc from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c19)) > This issue has been addressed in the following products: >  >   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 > <https://retrobowl25.com> > Via RHSA-2024:4474 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4474](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4474)  Hope these errors don't happen again.   ```   [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c22)  EllieBit    2024-12-09 09:52:34 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` If you are looking for an exciting game to entertain yourself, try <https://retrobowl25.io//> right now—it will provide you with thrilling and captivating football experiences.   ```   [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=2294604#c23)  ellieBit    2024-12-10 01:54:51 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` <https://retrobowl25.io/> is a great choice for those who love football; give it a try and feel the excitement in every match—you won't be disappointed   ``` |  |
