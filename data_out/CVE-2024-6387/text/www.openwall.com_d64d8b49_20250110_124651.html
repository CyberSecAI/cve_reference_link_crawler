Subject: Re: Announce: OpenSSH 9.8 released

Some nitpicks:

CVE-2006-5051 found by Mark Dowd, which was the original bug that got
relatively recently reintroduced as CVE-2024-6387, still has in its
description an erroneous reference to GSSAPI:

> Signal handler race condition in OpenSSH before 4.4 allows remote
> attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), and possibly execute
> arbitrary code if GSSAPI authentication is enabled, via unspecified
> vectors that lead to a double-free.

It was understood back in 2006 that this bug's exposure did not in fact
depend on GSSAPI:

I suggest removing " if GSSAPI authentication is enabled" from
CVE-2006-5051 description.  Maybe someone reading this can correct that.

Maybe I pay too much attention to historical detail, but this error in
CVE-2006-5051 did cause the question of GSSAPI (ir)relevance to come up
in CVE-2024-6387 discussions at least twice (that I know of).

Dug Song and I designed the original fake keystroke echo packets
mitigation, and per our advisory/article back then this was "initially
applied to OpenSSH starting with version 2.5.0.  OpenSSH 2.5.2 contains
the more complete versions of the fixes and solves certain
interoperability issues associated with the earlier versions."

<https://www.openwall.com/articles/SSH-Traffic-Analysis>

After the 9.8 release, I've added an update (clearly marked as such) to
the article above to refer to the issue reintroduction and the new fix.
I was also surprised by the reference to 2.9.9 above, so I checked
OpenSSH-portable commits.  To me, our original references to 2.5.x look
correct, and I have no idea where 2.9.9 came from.

Luckily, those old version references are not part of the CVE-2024-39894
description, so nothing to correct there.
