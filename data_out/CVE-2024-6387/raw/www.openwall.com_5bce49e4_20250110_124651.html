Hi Alexander,

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I've finally reviewed the links and re-read the thread.  Looks like
&gt; we're OK to proceed with adding CentOS Project's Hyperscale SIG as a
&gt; linux-distros member.
&gt; 
&gt; Michel, please e-mail me off-list with PGP keys for all of you who need
&gt; to be subscribed for Hyperscale.  I also need to know who will be
&gt; managing this subscription on your end (informing me of any changes in
&gt; who's to stay subscribed).
&gt;
Thank you! I'll email once I have collected all the keys.

&gt; &gt; All three of us are Fedora developers - but AIUI, we will not and can not use
&gt; &gt; membership here to contribute Fedora patches - until the embargo is
&gt; &gt; over.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For Hyperscale itself we plan to use the head start to have local builds
&gt; &gt; ready to go, and commit and do a public build as soon as the embargo is
&gt; &gt; over; if it needs collaboration we can use private Git repos and E2EE
&gt; &gt; private chats to discuss the fix among ourselves.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is, to the best of my knowledge, similar to how AlmaLinux handles
&gt; &gt; embargoed security issues - the fix is ready to go but is only made
&gt; &gt; available once the embargo is lifted.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now - wearing our Fedora hats, we certainly would try and help get this
&gt; &gt; fixed in Fedora once the embargo is over (as we've done before) - and
&gt; &gt; knowing a CVE is going to be made public would certainly help (e.g.
&gt; &gt; trying to make sure one of us is around) - but we won't be participating
&gt; &gt; in the list wearing our Fedora hat, or discuss embargoed issues with
&gt; &gt; people not on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; This understanding is correct.  The membership and embargoed info is
&gt; only for the specific distro "except with the reporter's explicit
&gt; approval".  This exception means that you may occasionally ask whoever
&gt; reported the issue to linux-distros for permission to use the
&gt; information e.g. also for preparing a fix for Fedora even though you're
&gt; subscribed for Hyperscale.  To avoid miscoordination, please keep such
&gt; requests also CC'ed to the list.  Uses of this exception have been very
&gt; rare so far, and it is expected that you wouldn't use it often, or else
&gt; it'd make more sense to discuss the additional distro becoming a member.
&gt;
Thanks. Good to know this exception exists, but I'm hoping to prod
Fedora to onboard itself as a member anyway.

&gt; FWIW, Fedora's fix for CVE-2024-6387 was quite timely as-is:
&gt; 
&gt; commit dcbca7b947cf82c30d6f477a26efd2f765204fe6
&gt; Author:     Gordon Messmer &lt;gordon.messmer&#64;...il.com&gt;
&gt; AuthorDate: Mon Jul 1 20:49:16 2024 -0700
&gt; Commit:     Gordon Messmer &lt;gordon.messmer&#64;...il.com&gt;
&gt; CommitDate: Tue Jul 2 00:48:16 2024 -0700
&gt; 
&gt;     Patch 9.6p1 for CVE-2024-6387
&gt; 
&gt; * Mon Jul 01 2024 Gordon Messmer &lt;gordon.messmer&#64;...il.com&gt; - 9.6p1-12
&gt; - Patch 9.6p1 for CVE-2024-6387
&gt; 
&gt; On one hand, this confirms that Fedora cares.  On the other, for an
&gt; issue with a trivial patch, I don't know if Fedora could have done much
&gt; or anything more to prepare.
&gt; 
It was timely .. but there was some scramble in Fedora's security room
the morning the embargo was lifted. It turns out the development Rawhide
branch was not in a buildable state at that moment - not a big deal, I
pointed out at the time that it's more important to fix the stable
releases - but with access to the embargo, someone could have fixed the
Rawhide build in preparation I suppose.

&gt; OpenSSH 9.8 released on July 1 also fixed "Logic error in ssh(1)
&gt; ObscureKeystrokeTiming", which became CVE-2024-39894 by July 3:
&gt; 
&gt; <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/03/6">https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/03/6</a>
&gt; 
&gt; Per upstream, this issue affects "9.5 through 9.7 (inclusive)", so I
&gt; guess Fedora's package based on 9.6p1 is vulnerable.  There doesn't
&gt; appear to be a fix in the package yet.  I see this is being tracked in:
&gt; 
&gt; <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2295615" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2295615</a>
&gt; 
&gt; which is assigned to Dmitry Belyavskiy, who is also the maintainer of
&gt; the OpenSSH package in RHEL and CentOS Stream.  RHEL is not affected and
&gt; the issue is low severity, so will probably take a long while to fix in
&gt; Fedora via Red Hat.  Maybe something the community could do quicker?
&gt; This is not directly related to possible linux-distros membership; this
&gt; issue wasn't even on linux-distros.
&gt;
Yeah - the CVE fixes were done by a non-maintainer anyway (Dmitry
understandably has his hands full with fixing RHEL and CentOS Stream).
This is tangential - but having a well-coordinated security team in
Fedora, that participates in this list and in linux-distros, would
likely help - e.g. by ensuring that the ACL of key packages like openssh
correlates to who often contributes to it, and by making sure issues
like these get addressed sooner rather than later.
