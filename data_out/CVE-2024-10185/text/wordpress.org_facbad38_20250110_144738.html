## FAQ

### How do I display YouTube Shorts from a specific YouTube Channel?

To display YouTube shorts, simply set the channel ID and set the layout to Shorts showcase like this:

[sw-youtube channel=”UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug” layout=”showcase”]

### How do I display YouTube videos from a specific YouTube Channel?

[sw-youtube channel=”UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug”]

### How do I display YouTube videos from a specific YouTube Playlist?

[sw-youtube playlist=”UUAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug”]

### How do I display YouTube live streams from a list of YouTube Channels?

[sw-youtube livestream=”UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw,UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug”]

### How do I create a YouTube API key?

This plugin requires a YouTube API key in order to pull data from YouTube. An API key from YouTube comes with an API quota of 10,000 units per day. For most sites, this YouTube API key quota will be enough to display all the YouTube channel content you wish.

I was hesitant to download it as well, since it didn’t have many reviews, but I gave it a try, and WOW it works really great! Not only that, I wanted some customisation, and I got support on Sunday, and solved by Monday. A+ if you ask me!

There is a lot of functionnality in this plugin, in my opinion it is the best plugin to embed youtube shorts and youtube videos for free. Then after installing it, the support helped me until everything was fixed.
Must have, I recommend it !

As always Streamweasels launches the best plugins for your wordpress site. You will be able to embed your youtube videos in different views and you will be able to show different live streamers, playlists or your favorite list. The free version is already very complete and the paid version is the best and you will have the best support even on discord!!
