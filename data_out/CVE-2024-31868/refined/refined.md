Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-31868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper encoding or escaping of output when loading Helium package information. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize the `helium.json` file's content before rendering it, making it susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `helium.json` file, which will then be executed by the victim's browser when the application renders this information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session who uses the vulnerable Zeppelin instance.
-   **Data Theft & Session Hijacking:** This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data, potentially resulting in account hijacking.
-   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could modify the content displayed on the Zeppelin interface.
-   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website or initiate downloads of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Modified `helium.json`:** An attacker needs to modify the `helium.json` file with malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Modify `helium.json`:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the content of the `helium.json` file. This could involve gaining access to the system hosting the file or exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system or application to achieve this.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.11.1 of Apache Zeppelin.
- The vulnerability affects versions 0.8.2 before 0.11.1.
