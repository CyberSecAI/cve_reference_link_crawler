- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zephyr Bluetooth host incorrectly trusts the `error_code` field of the encryption change event, instead of the `encrypt` field. This allows a malicious Bluetooth peripheral to falsely indicate a successful encryption procedure despite it being rejected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper handling of the encryption change event status.
    - Trusting the `error_code` field over the `encrypt` field.
    - Vulnerability present in multiple protocol layers (l2cap, att, smp, application).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Security vulnerability that exposes a number of protocol layers.
    - Isochronous channels (e.g. audio stream) may be established on a supposedly encrypted but actually unencrypted link.
    - Loss of data confidentiality, as data is transmitted without encryption.
    - Potential for integrity loss if an attacker can modify unencrypted data.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Malicious Bluetooth peripheral sending a rejection with an error code indicating success.
    - Attack occurs within Bluetooth range.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs a custom-made Bluetooth peripheral capable of sending the malicious `REJECT_IND` or `REJECT_EXT_IND` packets with a success code.
    - The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable Zephyr device (Adjacent).
