The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in a free and open-source inventory management system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is located in the `/app/ajax/search_sales_report.php` file. The `customer` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization or parameterization when used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
* An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to:
    *  Access sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, customer data).
    *  Modify data (e.g., change prices, delete records).
    *  Potentially gain control of the underlying database server depending on the database user privileges and the underlying system
    * Obtain information about the database structure.

**Attack vectors:**
* The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP requests, specifically via a POST request to `/app/ajax/search_sales_report.php`.
* The vulnerable parameter is `customer`, which is submitted via the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
* No authentication or authorization is explicitly mentioned as a requirement. Based on the provided code and content, it can be assumed the vulnerability can be reached by an authenticated user with access to the sales report feature, or potentially by an unauthenticated user depending on the application's logic.

**Additional notes:**
* The provided content includes a proof of concept (POC) HTTP request and screenshots from SQLmap, demonstrating the successful exploitation of the vulnerability. The provided SQL payload uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` to inject data into the response, further demonstrating the successful exploitation of the vulnerability.
* The application is hosted on `www.sourcecodester.com`, indicating a third party application that is likely publicly available.
* The provided exploit details are more extensive than a typical CVE description.
