Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-2773 from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The MySQL server's pid file can be created in a world-writeable directory. This is due to an unspecified vulnerability in how the pid file is created and handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The core issue is that the MySQL server process has the ability to create its process ID (pid) file in a location where any user can write to it. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege, and opens up a possibility of symlink attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation (potential):** While not directly stated to lead to privilege escalation, this is a common path of attack for insecurely created pid files. By having write access to a pid file that is used by a privileged process, a malicious user can try to manipulate the contents of the pid file to point to a malicious program.
*  **Denial of Service (potential):** While less likely, manipulation of the pid file can lead to service crashes. 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system because it involves file system manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a user on the system with the ability to write to the directory in which the pid file is created.
*   **Ability to write to the MySQL pidfile:** The attacker must have write access to the directory where the pidfile resides.

**Additional details from the provided documents**

*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat's advisory (RHSA-2018:3655) confirms the "pid file can be created in a world-writeable directory" as the description for CVE-2018-2773. The fix involves upgrading `rh-mysql57-mysql` to version 5.7.24.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu's advisories (USN-3629-1, USN-3629-2) list CVE-2018-2773 as part of a larger set of MySQL vulnerabilities fixed by upgrading to MySQL 5.5.60 or 5.7.22. USN-3629-2 specifically affects Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.
*   **NetApp:** NetApp's advisory (NTAP-20180419-0002) lists CVE-2018-2773 as one of the multiple vulnerabilities in MySQL that can lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, data access, or DoS. NetApp products incorporating Oracle MySQL are affected.
*  **Debian:** Debian's advisory (DSA-4176-1) mentions that the vulnerability is fixed in mysql-5.5 version 5.5.60-0+deb8u1 and also recommends to upgrade their mysql-5.5 packages.

**Summary**
The primary issue associated with CVE-2018-2773 is the potential for a local user to exploit insecure file permissions on the MySQL pid file to perform malicious activities which can lead to a denial of service or potential privilege escalation.
