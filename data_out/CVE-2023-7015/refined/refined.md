Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7015

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'tb' parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input, specifically the 'tb' parameter, before displaying it in a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   If a user is tricked into clicking a malicious link containing the exploit, the attacker's script will execute in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This allows for various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Performing actions on the user's behalf.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs. An attacker creates a malicious link that includes the injected script in the 'tb' parameter.
*   The attacker must then trick a user into clicking the malicious link. This is typically done through social engineering tactics such as phishing emails, malicious advertisements, or compromised websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link (social engineering or compromised site).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the File Manager Pro plugin up to and including version 8.3.4.
*   The vulnerability is patched in version 8.3.5.
*   The CVSS score is 6.1 (Medium).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tobias Wei√ühaar (kun\_19).
