The content provided relates to CVE-2024-0914.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a timing side-channel in the `opencryptoki` package when handling RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padded ciphertexts. This vulnerability is also known as the "Marvin Attack."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Timing side-channel in the processing of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padded ciphertexts, allowing an attacker to potentially deduce information by observing the time taken for decryption or signing operations.
- The vulnerability affects the `opencryptoki` packages, which contain version 2.11 of the PKCS#11 API, implemented for IBM Cryptocards.
- The root cause lies in the implementation of the RSA decryption and signing operations within `opencryptoki`, where the processing time of PKCS#1 v1.5 padding reveals information about the input ciphertext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to decrypt RSA ciphertexts or forge RSA signatures without access to the private key.
- In the context of a TLS server, an attacker could potentially record a session and decrypt it later.
- While the attack is more challenging with forward secure cipher suites, it's still possible under certain conditions by performing a massively parallel attack to forge a server signature before a client times out.
- Other interfaces performing RSA decryption in an automated manner, such as S/MIME, JSON web tokens, and hardware tokens (HSMs, smartcards), are also potentially vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a large amount of specifically crafted messages to a service using the vulnerable API and precisely measuring the timing of the responses.
- The attacker needs to be able to observe the time taken for decryption or signing operations.
- Network proximity to the victim might allow for a more practical attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with a service using the vulnerable `opencryptoki` API.
- Precise timing measurements of the response times from the vulnerable API is required for a successful attack.
- A large number of crafted messages must be sent to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- Co-location or network proximity to the victim system may be needed to carry out a practical attack.

**Additional Details:**

- The "Marvin Attack" is a variant of the Bleichenbacher attack, which exploits timing differences to decrypt RSA ciphertexts.
- The vulnerability affects a wide variety of implementations, even those previously believed to be immune.
- Fixes for this vulnerability involve constant-time implementations, meaning they are designed to process requests in the same time regardless of input data to prevent information leakage.
- It is recommended to disable the RSA ciphersuites in TLS, and use ECDH or DH-based key exchanges and RSA-OEAP padding when using RSA.
