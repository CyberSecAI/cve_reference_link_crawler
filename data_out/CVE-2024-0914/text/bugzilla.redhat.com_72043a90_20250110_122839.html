| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2260407#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-01-25 22:37:01 UTC  ``` Description: A timing side-channel in handling of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padded ciphertexts was discovered in the opencryptoki package. This side-channel can be used to perform RSA ciphertext decryption or signing without access to the private key. To achieve a successful decryption the attack would  need to send a large amount of specifically crafted messages to a service that uses the vulnerable API.  Fixed in: No fixed-in version yet, but a new release is expected in the next 3 weeks or so. Patches are already merged though.
