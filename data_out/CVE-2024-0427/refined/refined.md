- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape user-controlled input when it is reflected in some of its AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization and output encoding.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `position_modal` parameter of an AJAX request (`admin-ajax.php`), an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser when they access the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to entice a victim to click the malicious URL. No authentication is required for exploitation.
