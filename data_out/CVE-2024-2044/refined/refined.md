Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in pgAdmin4's session handling mechanism.
- pgAdmin4 uses file-based session management, storing session data as pickled objects on disk.
- The `FileBackedSessionManager.get` method, which retrieves session files based on a session ID from the user's cookie, is vulnerable.
- The method uses `os.path.join` to construct the path to the session file by concatenating the session ID with the `sessions` directory path.
- `os.path.join` does not prevent path traversal, allowing an attacker to manipulate the session ID to access arbitrary files by using `..` in the session ID.
- The content of the identified file is then deserialized using `pickle.load`, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Path Traversal:** The usage of `os.path.join` without proper sanitization on the session ID allows path traversal.
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The usage of `pickle.load` on user-controlled data allows for the execution of arbitrary code when a malicious pickle object is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running pgAdmin4.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Windows:**
    - An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious session cookie with a UNC path to a file located on a malicious SMB server (e.g., `//attacker_host/share/nt.pickle!a`).
    - When the server attempts to load the session, the malicious file is loaded and deserialized using pickle, leading to RCE.
- **Linux/POSIX:**
    - An authenticated attacker must have a valid user account to use the **Storage Manager** component to upload a malicious pickle file.
    - The attacker then crafts a session cookie with a path to the uploaded malicious pickle file (e.g., `../storage/<email>/posix.pickle!a`).
    - When the server attempts to load the session, the malicious file is loaded and deserialized using pickle, leading to RCE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Windows:**
    - Unauthenticated access to the pgAdmin4 web interface.
    - Ability to set an arbitrary cookie value.
    - Control over a publicly accessible SMB share.
- **Linux/POSIX:**
    - Valid user credentials for the pgAdmin4 instance.
    - Ability to upload files using the **Storage Manager** component.
    - Ability to set an arbitrary cookie value.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in pgAdmin4 versions up to and including 8.3.
- The vulnerability is fixed in pgAdmin 8.4.
- The vulnerability does not affect users running pgAdmin in desktop mode.
- The provided content also includes a detailed proof of concept and a disclosure timeline.
