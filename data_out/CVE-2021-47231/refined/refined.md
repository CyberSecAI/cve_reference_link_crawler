{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Memory leak due to unfreed usb_coherent buffers in the mcba_usb driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The driver allocates coherent buffers using usb_alloc_coherent in mcba_usb_start() but does not free them when the device is disconnected."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak, which can lead to system instability if the device is frequently connected and disconnected.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Repeatedly connecting and disconnecting the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer tool."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A user with the ability to connect and disconnect the USB device."
  },
  "patch": {
    "description": "The patch adds explicit usb_free_coherent calls in the mcba_urb_unlink function to free the allocated coherent buffers.",
    "changes": [
      "Added rxbuf and rxbuf_dma arrays in the mcba_priv struct to store allocated buffers and their DMA addresses.",
      "Modified mcba_usb_start() to store the allocated buffer and DMA address in the respective arrays.",
      "Modified mcba_urb_unlink() to free allocated coherent buffers using usb_free_coherent, iterating over the previously allocated rxbuf and rxbuf_dma arrays."
    ]
  },
  "details": "The mcba_usb driver allocates 20 coherent buffers when mcba_usb_start() is called. These buffers are not freed when the USB device is disconnected because the URB_FREE_BUFFER flag is not set and cannot be used with coherent buffers. This results in a memory leak that is detected by kmemleak. The fix explicitly calls usb_free_coherent() to free these buffers in mcba_urb_unlink() when the device is disconnected."
