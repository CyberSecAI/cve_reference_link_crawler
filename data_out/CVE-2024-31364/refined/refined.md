- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ELEX WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discounts plugin does not properly validate requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while authenticated. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into initiating it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication, but needs to target an authenticated user.
