Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23113:

**CVE-2022-23113**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Publish Over SSH Plugin performs insufficient validation of the file name. Specifically, it only checks if a file name is present, without proper sanitization, leading to path traversal.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with `Item/Configure` permission can exploit this vulnerability to discover the name of files on the Jenkins controller. This could potentially lead to further attacks, especially if sensitive files are exposed.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker with `Item/Configure` permission could craft a malicious file name to perform the path traversal.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have `Item/Configure` permission within Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional notes**
* The vulnerability exists in Publish Over SSH Plugin version 1.22 and earlier.
* At the time of the advisory publication, no fix was available for this vulnerability.
