- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials within the audit logs when extended logging mode is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Storage of sensitive information in clear text (CWE-532).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain access to sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to confidential information, including personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the audit logs on an affected system. For logs stored in the RoomOS Cloud, the attacker needs valid administrator-level credentials. The system also needs to have the extended logging mode enabled, which is disabled by default.
