- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `currency_code` parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can append additional SQL queries into existing queries, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive information from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the `currency_code` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated attackers with "Seller" level access or higher are required to exploit this vulnerability.
