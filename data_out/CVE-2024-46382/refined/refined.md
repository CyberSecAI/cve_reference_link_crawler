Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the AdminOrderController.java component. Specifically, the goodsId, goodsSn, and name parameters are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the AdminOrderController.java.

Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the database.

Attack vectors: The attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin/order/list` endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code into the `nickname` parameter (as demonstrated in the provided steps to reproduce) or potentially `goodsId` and `goodsSn` parameters, leading to SQL injection.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application and be able to send HTTP requests. Knowledge of the application's API is beneficial. They can trigger this vulnerability remotely with no authentication requirement mentioned in the provided content
