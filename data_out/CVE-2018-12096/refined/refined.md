The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in `liblnk`, a library for accessing Windows Shortcut Files (.LNK). This content specifically covers CVE-2018-12096, CVE-2018-12097, and CVE-2018-12098.

**CVE-2018-12096**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer over-read in `liblnk_data_string_get_utf8_string_size` function.
*   **Weakness:** The function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing a crafted LNK file.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure due to the heap-based buffer over-read.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted LNK file to the vulnerable library.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to provide a crafted .LNK file to the application using the vulnerable `liblnk` library.

**CVE-2018-12097**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer over-read in `liblnk_location_information_read_data` function.
*  **Weakness:** The function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing a crafted LNK file.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure due to the heap-based buffer over-read.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted LNK file to the vulnerable library.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to provide a crafted .LNK file to the application using the vulnerable `liblnk` library.

**CVE-2018-12098**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer over-read in `liblnk_data_block_read` function.
*   **Weakness:** The function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing a crafted LNK file.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure due to the heap-based buffer over-read.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted LNK file to the vulnerable library.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to provide a crafted .LNK file to the application using the vulnerable `liblnk` library.

The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, including:
