Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `edit_activity_query.php` file of the Internship Portal Management System. The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input for the `title`, `description`, `start`, and `end` parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to bypass authentication and access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Arbitrary Queries:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially compromising the entire database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate HTTP requests by including malicious SQL code within the parameters `title`, `description`, `start`, and `end` of the `edit_activity_query.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application to send the malicious HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of the application's endpoints:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerable endpoint `edit_activity_query.php` and the affected parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `edit_activity_query.php` file.
- The vulnerability is present in the Internship Portal Management System version 1.0.
- The vulnerability allows attackers to add additional SQL statements to predefined SQL statements in the web application.
