REST API behavior on module lock, security problem in client

* REST API: Changed the behavior if a module lock request failed from a HTTP 400 with [Nullpointer Exception] to HTTP 400 ([Lock failed reason Exception])
* Fixed a security problem in the client if one of your trading partners sent you prepared XML data and you opened the details of this transaction in the client. Files can be written to the computer on which the client process is running. The server process is not affected.
