- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the client application's handling of XML data received from trading partners. Specifically, if a trading partner sends prepared XML data and a user opens the transaction details in the client, files can be written to the computer running the client process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation when processing XML data from external sources. The client application does not adequately protect against malicious XML that could cause unintended file writing on the client machine.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker (a malicious trading partner) to write arbitrary files to the computer running the mendelson AS4 client. This can lead to various impacts, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service by filling the disk.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious trading partner sending specially crafted XML data through the mendelson AS4 system. When the receiving client user opens transaction details, the prepared XML triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a trading partner with the ability to send XML data to a mendelson AS4 system. They must be able to craft malicious XML data to exploit the vulnerability.
