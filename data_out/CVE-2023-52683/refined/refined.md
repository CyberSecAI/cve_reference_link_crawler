{
  "CVE-2023-52683": {
    "Description": "In lpit_update_residency() there is a possibility of overflow in multiplication, if tsc_khz is large enough (> UINT_MAX/1000). Change multiplication to mul_u32_u32().",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in multiplication.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is not explicitly mentioned, but an integer overflow could lead to incorrect calculations and potentially unexpected behavior or other issues related to the LPIT functionality. This could cause incorrect power management and lead to system instability.",
   "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability exists in the ACPI LPIT driver, and a malicious actor could potentially trigger the overflow by manipulating the `tsc_khz` value to be large enough during the system boot or runtime through ACPI table manipulation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with the ability to influence ACPI parameters, potentially through malicious firmware or through a crafted ACPI table, is required to exploit this vulnerability."
