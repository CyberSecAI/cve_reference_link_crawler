## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Which versions of ansi-regex are impacted by this vulnerability? Several scanners are flagging all versions of this library other than 5.0.1 and 6.0.1. I suspect some of the older versions aren't impacted, because the pattern variable is different (just spot checked I think v2.1.1 and v3).

Sorry, something went wrong.

Not sure because the security researchers are not doing their due diligence and are instead farming bounty money on e.g. huntr.dev, targeting the most used repositories for clout.

I'm really not sure what to do about this and it's eating a lot of time away. The vulnerability itself is not major - unless you're allowing long AND unsanitized user input to hit the API directly, the vulnerability doesn't affect you.

I have no idea which versions it actually affects because they didn't test it correctly.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Confirmed 4.1.0 and 3.0.0 as affected testing using the provided reproducer. 2.1.1 does not reproduce the issue.

3.0.0 is the first affected, as that's the first version that includes [69bebf6](https://github.com/chalk/ansi-regex/commit/69bebf6b8b1ac9b4d70a411109b88bb650972f65) that the problematic part of the regex.

Would someone be able to help me understand the exact formatting going on here?

I assume that the `\` backslashes are escaped because this is within a string, meaning `\u001B` must be represented as `\\u001B` ?

I copied the "proposed" escaped original into [regex101](https://regex101.com/r/UR7Ma5/1) and removed the escape characters to produce this:

`[\u001B\u009B][[\]()#;?]*(?:(?:(?:(?:;[-a-zA-Z\d\/#&.:=?%@~_]+)*|[a-zA-Z\d]+(?:;[-a-zA-Z\d\/#&.:=?%@~_]*)*)?\u0007)`

I then plugged that unescaped version [back in](https://regex101.com/r/UR7Ma5/2) to determine whether there were any problems with the pattern itself, and see that there is an incomplete/unclosed `(?:` which should probably be removed:

`[\u001B\u009B][[\]()#;?]*(?:(?:;[-a-zA-Z\d\/#&.:=?%@~_]+)*|[a-zA-Z\d]+(?:;[-a-zA-Z\d\/#&.:=?%@~_]*)*)?\u0007`

The next outer `(?: ... )` group appears to have no alternations or quantifiers, so can probably also be removed:

`(?:(?:;[-a-zA-Z\d\/#&.:=?%@~_]+)*|[a-zA-Z\d]+(?:;[-a-zA-Z\d\/#&.:=?%@~_]*)*)?\u0007)`

The next `(?: ... | ... )?` group does contain an alternation, and is qualified by its `?` quantifier. Immediately after this optional group, it looks for `\u0007` at the end.

Within both alternations, the character groups `[-a-zA-Z\d\/#&.:=?%@~_]` can be shortened: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` or `[a-zA-Z\d_]` can be replaced with `\w`, so: `[-\w\/#&.:=?%@~]`.

That would look like this:

`[\u001B\u009B][[\]()#;?]*(?:(?:;[-\w\/#&.:=?%@~]+)*|[a-zA-Z\d]+(?:;[-\w\/#&.:=?%@~]*)*)?\u0007`

So, within the first alternation, it matches a semicolon `;` followed by **one** or more of those character-group characters. Within the second alternation, it first looks for letters or numbers, followed by any number of semicolon `;` followed by **zero** or more of those character-group characters. I'm not sure whether that would want to be a `+` one-or-more, since that would allow "abc;;;;;;;;;" to match there instead of requiring characters between those semicolons.

If you look at [this example](https://regex101.com/r/UR7Ma5/3), I've changed the outer non-capturing `(?: ... )?` to a capturing group just for illustrative purposes so you can see how the semicolon is matched in one case but not in the other due to this **zero** or more quantifiers. You can see this when the semicolon is added to the text in [this next example](https://regex101.com/r/UR7Ma5/4).

If both `;[-\w\/#&.:=?%@~]` character groups are quantified with zero-or-more `*`, then subsequent semicolons `;;` will match, while if they are quantified with one-or-more `+`, the match fails due to subsequent semicolons `;;`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Neither 3.0.1, nor 4.1.1 are listed on <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-regex> (under Versions), btw.

Sorry, something went wrong.

> Would someone be able to help me understand the exact formatting going on here?

[@OnlineCop](https://github.com/OnlineCop) can you first help me understand what exactly is your question here? Are you trying to understand what the code is doing? Are you proposing a readability improvement? Or performance improvement? Sorry, you said a lot of things but I couldn't even understand what is your goal, roughly...

> I assume that the `\` backslashes are escaped because this is within a string, meaning `\u001B` must be represented as `\\u001B` ?

Yes, exactly.

In the original, lines 2-5 were looking for:

1. either `\u001B` (ESC) or `\u009B` (¢ cent sign) followed by 0 or more of these characters: `[]()#;?`

After that, it was looking for either:

2. any number of letters, numbers, semi-colons, or special characters that came before `\u0007` (BEL)

- There were a *lot* of 0-or-more groups, all of which was also within its own `(?:...)?` 0-or-1 (optional) group, before that BEL.

- It was definitely something that could cause ReDoS.

3. or an optional group of digits and semi-colons, followed by a single character in the range `[\dA-PR-TZcf-ntqry=><~]`.

- This optional group also had potential for a ReDoS.

In the revised version, lines 2-5 were looking for the same characters as 1. above, but increased the variety of characters allowed before `\u0007` and still has a lot of potential for ReDoS (possibly more than before).

I don't understand what exactly is supposed to be matched here. Both BEFORE and AFTER versions have a high probability to cause catastrophic backtracking. Are there any tests that should match either of the BEFORE or AFTER regexes?

Feel free to create a reproduction case that exploits exponential time complexity and file an issue. Otherwise I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
