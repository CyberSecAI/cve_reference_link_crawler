Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the imx UART driver's transmit state machine when used in RS485 mode. Specifically, when a TTY port is closed during an ongoing transmission (e.g., due to a userland application crash), the `imx_uart_shutdown` function disables the interface and the Transmission Complete (TC) interrupt. The `imx_uart_stop_tx` function then bails out on an incomplete transmission, expecting the TC interrupt to retrigger it. However, since the TC interrupt is disabled, the state machine gets stuck in the `SEND` state, leading to a deadlock. This leaves the TX_EN pin low, rendering the interface unusable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incomplete state transition handling in `imx_uart_stop_tx` when TC interrupts are disabled.
- Lack of proper handling of incomplete transmissions when the TTY port is closed unexpectedly.
- The logic assumes that a TC interrupt will always be available to retrigger the state machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The imx UART port becomes unusable due to the state machine deadlock. The RS485 transceiver's TX_EN pin remains low, preventing further communication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Closing the TTY port during an ongoing transmission. This could happen due to:
   - Userland application crash
   - Manual closing of the port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the TTY device using the imx UART driver in RS485 mode.
- The attacker must be able to trigger a scenario where the TTY port is closed during transmission. This could involve:
   - Having an application that uses the serial port and can be crashed.
   - Directly closing the serial port.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding a check in `imx_uart_stop_tx` to ensure that the TC interrupt is enabled before bailing on an incomplete transmission. This ensures that the state machine handling will reach the `WAIT_AFTER_SEND` state.
- The provided commit messages and diffs show the specific changes made to address the vulnerability.
- Multiple git commits address this issue, each with the same fix.
- The issue affects imx UART ports used in RS485 mode, where the RTS pin is used to drive the transceiver's TX_EN pin.
