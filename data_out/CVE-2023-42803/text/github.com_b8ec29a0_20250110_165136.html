### What does this PR do?

It fixes 3 things in total:

* Integration of `insertDocument` with presentation-uploader toast notification;
* Wrongly handled error within this endpoint;
* Validation of mime type for `insertDocument` endpoint and deletion of mistaken files.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Avoid placing this kind of function in the Controller... I think it fits better in the class `SupportedFileTypes` in `bbb-common-web`.

| I'm not able to send `.ppt` files:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5660191/203976841-f374e97c-7822-4d85-8bec-868385e64eb6.png)  The mime identified for the file is `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation`. It is weird because this mime was supposed to be used for `.pptx`, maybe these days `ppt` and `pptx` are using the same mime, not sure. |
