Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a division-by-zero error in the `vmpressure_calc_level()` function within the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem. This occurs due to an underflow in the `scan_control->nr_scanned` counter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Integer Underflow:** The code attempts to deduct `scan_control->nr_scanned` within the `evict_folios()` function. When `shrink_folio_list()` does not increment `nr_scanned` (e.g. due to a failed `folio_trylock()`), this can lead to an underflow if a second pass is performed to reclaim folios that became clean.
-   **Division by Zero:** The underflow in `nr_scanned` results in `scale` becoming zero, leading to a division-by-zero error in `vmpressure_calc_level()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Kernel Crash:** The division-by-zero error causes a kernel crash. The provided logs indicate `[exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101] process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b`.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The vulnerability is triggered during the memory reclamation process, specifically when `evict_folios()` is called to reclaim folios that have gone through page writeback and become clean. This is part of the multi-generational LRU (MGLRU) algorithm.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker would need to trigger a memory pressure situation that causes the kernel to execute the vulnerable code path in `evict_folios()` with a specific sequence of events that causes the underflow of the scan counter. This might involve allocating and deallocating memory to trigger the MGLRU reclamation process.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The fix involves removing the deduction of `scan_control->nr_scanned` in `evict_folios()`, because `scan_control->nr_scanned` has no established semantics and potential double counting has minimal risk.
-   The vulnerability is located in the `mm/vmscan.c` file.
-   The fix is identified by commit `8b671fe1a879923ecfb72dda6caf01460dd885ef`.
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `359a5e1416ca`.
