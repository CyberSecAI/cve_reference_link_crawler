  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability in the `grade` parameter within the `/view/timetable_update_form.php` file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to the leakage of sensitive user or system data, and may compromise overall system security. Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface by crafting a malicious SQL injection payload within the `grade` parameter of the `timetable_update_form.php` file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `grade` parameter."
