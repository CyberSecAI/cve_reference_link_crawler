**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

In the module “Account Manager - Sales Representative & Dealers - CRM” (prestasalesmanager) up to version 8.0.0 from Presta World for PrestaShop, a guest can download personal information without restriction by performing a path traversal attack.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2024-25840](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25840)
* **Published at**: 2024-02-27
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: prestasalesmanager
* **Impacted release**: <= 8.0.0 (9.0.0 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Presta World
* **Weakness**: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
* **Severity**: high (7.5)

## Description

The method `PrestaSalesManagerChatboxModuleFrontController::postProcess()` has sensitive action that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a Path traversal attack.

Note : We are forced to tag it as a high gravity due to the CWE type 22 but be warned that on our ecosystem, it must be considered critical since it unlocks hundreds admin’s ajax script of modules due to [this](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/6c05518b807d014ee8edb811041e3de232520c28/classes/Tools.php#L1247)

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller’s path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see “POST /” inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod\_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: none
* **Availability**: none

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## Possible malicious usage

* Stealing secrets to unlock admin controllers based on ajax script
* Exfiltrate all modules with all versions to facilitate pentesting
* Stealing table\_prefix to greatly facilitate SQL injections for kiddies who don’t know how to exploit DBMS design’s vulnerabilities or steal database access to login in exposed PHPMyAdmin / Adminer / etc.
* Bypass WAF / htaccess restrictions to read forbidden files (such as logs on predictable paths of banks’s modules inside /var/log/)

## Patch from 8.0.0

```
--- 8.0.0/modules/prestasalesmanager/controllers/front/chatbox.php
+++ 9.0.0/modules/prestasalesmanager/controllers/front/chatbox.php
...
-           $file = Tools::getValue('file');
+           $file = basename(Tools::getValue('file'));
-           $id_ticket = Tools::getValue('id_presta_product_enquiry');
+           $id_ticket = (int) Tools::getValue('id_presta_product_enquiry');

```
## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **prestasalesmanager**.
* NEVER expose a PHPMyAdmin / Adminer / etc without, at least, a htpasswd
* Activate OWASP 930’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall) and adjust it for your PrestaShop
