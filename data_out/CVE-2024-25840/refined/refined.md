The provided content is related to CVE-2024-25840.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `PrestaSalesManagerChatboxModuleFrontController::postProcess()` method of the `prestasalesmanager` module. Specifically, the `file` parameter obtained via `Tools::getValue('file')` is not sanitized, allowing for path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: The module fails to properly validate the file path provided by the user, enabling attackers to access files and directories outside the intended scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach**: Attackers can download personal information and potentially other sensitive files by traversing directories.
- **Stealing Secrets**: Attackers can steal secrets used to unlock admin controllers based on AJAX scripts.
- **Module Exfiltration**: Attackers can exfiltrate all modules with all versions, facilitating further penetration testing and identifying other vulnerabilities.
- **Database Compromise**: Attackers can obtain the database table prefix, which can make SQL injection attacks easier. They can also steal database access credentials leading to compromise of PHPMyAdmin/Adminer installations.
- **Bypassing Security Measures**: Attackers can bypass WAF/htaccess restrictions to access restricted files such as logs, including bank module logs.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **HTTP POST Request**: A simple HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint can trigger the path traversal vulnerability. The module's controller path can be concealed during exploitation and appear as a regular "POST /" request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication required**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users (guests).
- **No user interaction needed**: The vulnerability is directly exploitable with a crafted HTTP request.
- **Low Attack Complexity**: Exploitation of the vulnerability requires minimal technical expertise.
