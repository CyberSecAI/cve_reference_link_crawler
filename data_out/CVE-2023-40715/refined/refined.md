- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the storage of external server passwords in cleartext within the FortiTester database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext storage of sensitive information [CWE-312].
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the FortiTester database can retrieve plaintext passwords of external servers configured in the device, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the FortiTester database is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the FortiTester's database. This could be achieved through a variety of methods, such as compromising the server hosting the database, or exploiting another vulnerability that allows for database access.
