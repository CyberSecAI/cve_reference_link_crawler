- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The YaMaps for WordPress plugin (versions <= 0.6.28) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability allows the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper input sanitization or output encoding, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could allow malicious actors to inject scripts that can redirect users, display unwanted advertisements, or execute other HTML payloads. This could lead to unauthorized access to user sessions, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the website through a vulnerability in the plugin. The exact method of injection (e.g. specific input fields or parameters) is not specified in the provided content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts into the website. The content specifies that a "Contributor" level privilege is needed, implying this could be achieved using the plugin's features or through other means that permit user input.
