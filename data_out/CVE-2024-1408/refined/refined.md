Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1408

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** WordPress ProfilePress Plugin (versions <= 4.14.4)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `edit-profile-text-box` shortcode. User-supplied attributes, like 'type', are not properly handled, allowing malicious code injection.

**Weaknesses:**
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation.
- Lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.
- Lack of output escaping.

**Impact:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script will execute within their browser. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement
- Redirection to malicious sites
- Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vector:**
- The attack is executed by injecting malicious code within the `edit-profile-text-box` shortcode attributes. 
- This shortcode is then used within a WordPress page or post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   Authenticated attacker with contributor-level permissions or higher.
-  Ability to add or edit content (pages/posts) containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `FieldsShortcodeCallback.php` file.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 4.15.0 by implementing proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied attributes within the shortcode.
- The vulnerable shortcode is `[edit-profile-text-box]`.
