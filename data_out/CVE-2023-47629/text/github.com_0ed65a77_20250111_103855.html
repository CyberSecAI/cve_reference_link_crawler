# Privilege escalation through email sign-up

High

[david-leifker](/david-leifker)
published
GHSA-vj59-23ww-p6c8
Nov 13, 2023

## Package

docker

datahub-gms, datahub-frontend
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

< 0.12.1

## Patched versions

0.12.1

## Description

## Summary

Sign-up through an invite link does not properly restrict users from signing up as privileged accounts.

## Details

If a user is given an email sign-up link they can potentially create an admin account given certain preconditions. If the default datahub user has been removed, then the user can sign up for an account that leverages the default policies giving admin privileges to the datahub user.

## PoC

Given an invite link, sign up for an account with datahub as the username. If default permissions have not also been removed then the newly signed up account has admin privileges.

## Impact

All DataHub instances prior to the patch that have removed the datahub user, but not the default policies applying to that user.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
