{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on guest users configuring Wi-Fi access points. Specifically, the system allows guest users to access a Wi-Fi configuration dialog, even when they lack the necessary permissions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP). The system should prevent guest users, who typically have limited privileges, from accessing or modifying certain Wi-Fi settings.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A guest user could potentially modify or view Wi-Fi settings that should be restricted to more privileged users. This could lead to unauthorized access, network configuration changes, or information disclosure, depending on the specific capabilities exposed through the settings dialog.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a guest user attempting to access the Wi-Fi configuration dialog.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a guest user on an affected device."
