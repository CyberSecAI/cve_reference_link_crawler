Anybus-CompactCom 30 products are vulnerable to a XSS attack caused by the lack of input sanitation checks. As a consequence, it is possible to insert HTML code into input fields and store the HTML code. The stored HTML code will be embedded in the page and executed by host browser the next time the page is loaded, enabling social engineering attacks.
