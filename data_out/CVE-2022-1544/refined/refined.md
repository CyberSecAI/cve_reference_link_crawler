Based on the provided information, this commit addresses a CSV injection vulnerability, which is related to CVE-2022-1544

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data when exporting to CSV format. Specifically, certain characters like `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` at the beginning of a cell can be interpreted as formulas or commands by spreadsheet software, leading to CSV injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSV Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the possibility of injecting malicious content into a CSV file through formulas.
- **Insufficient Sanitization:** Before the fix, the `ExportHelper` did not sanitize values, which allowed special characters to be rendered as formulas in spreadsheet programs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** When the exported CSV is opened in a spreadsheet application, injected formulas could be executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious formulas could be used to extract data or redirect the user to malicious sites.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially alter data within the spreadsheet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** Malicious data could be injected via user input fields.
- **Exported Data:** The application generates CSV files that contain user-provided data without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Data Input:** The attacker would need the ability to input or manipulate data that is subsequently exported to CSV.
- **Victim Interaction:** The victim would need to open the maliciously crafted CSV file on their computer using a vulnerable spreadsheet program.

**Details:**
The commit introduces a `sanitizeValue` function which:
-  Replaces `"` with `""` to escape double quotes.
-  If a cell value starts with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`  or a new line character  it prepends a single quote (`'`) to it, effectively neutralizing formula execution.

The tests added assert that the injection of these characters are now properly sanitized.
