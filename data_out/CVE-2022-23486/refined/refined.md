- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of resource management in libp2p allows an attacker to cause excessive memory allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability arises from the ability of an attacker to cause a victim node to allocate a large number of small memory chunks. This is achieved by opening numerous streams on a single connection (using multiplexers like mplex or yamux), sending partial payloads, or tricking the victim into pre-allocating buffers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The victim's process runs out of memory and is killed by the OS. When executed continuously, this can cause a denial of service, particularly at scale when targeted at multiple nodes.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via network connections by opening many streams, sending partial payloads, or causing pre-allocation of buffers on a libp2p network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections with the victim node and send data to it to exploit the vulnerability. No specific privileges or user interactions are required.
