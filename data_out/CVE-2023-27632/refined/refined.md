- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Daily Prayer Time plugin versions <= 2023.03.08 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions on the plugin under their current authentication. This is a general description, and specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** CSRF attacks, where an attacker crafts a malicious request that is executed by an authenticated user's browser without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
