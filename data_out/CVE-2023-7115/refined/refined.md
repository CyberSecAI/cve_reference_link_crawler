Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-7115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the PageLayer plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input within its settings, specifically the "Address" field in the Information section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS.  The plugin does not sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the plugin's settings and executed when other users view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of any user accessing the affected page in the WordPress admin panel. This can lead to:
  - Account takeover
  - Data theft
  - Website defacement
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Address" field within the Information section of the PageLayer settings page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin or High-Privilege User:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, to access and modify the plugin's settings.
- **WordPress Admin Panel Access:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress admin panel.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting the following payload into the "Address" field: `</textarea><script>alert(1);</script><textarea>`. This payload exploits the lack of sanitization by injecting a `<script>` tag that executes JavaScript code.

**Additional Information:**
- **Fixed in version:** 1.8.1
- **CVSS Score:** 3.4 (Low)
- **CWE:** CWE-79
- **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
