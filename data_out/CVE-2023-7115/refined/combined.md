## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# PageLayer < 1.8.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Enter the following payload in the Address field within the Information section of Pagelayer Settings: </textarea><script>alert(1);</script><textarea>
2. Click "Save Changes" to trigger it.

### Affects Plugins
