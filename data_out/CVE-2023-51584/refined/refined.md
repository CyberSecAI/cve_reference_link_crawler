Root cause of vulnerability: An exposed dangerous method within the shutdown functionality of the Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro application.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application exposes a dangerous method that can be triggered through a shutdown operation.

Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

Attack vectors: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by triggering a shutdown operation.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application remotely and must induce an administrator to trigger the shutdown operation. User interaction (an administrator triggering a shutdown operation) is required for the exploit.
