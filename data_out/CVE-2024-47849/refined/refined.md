Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-47849:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the Cargo extension for MediaWiki not properly sanitizing or restricting SQL functions within backticks in user-provided queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (via backticks):** The Cargo extension's query parser incorrectly allows users to embed arbitrary SQL functions within backticks. This allows execution of functions that should be restricted or disallowed. Specifically, the `RAND()` function could be used, even though it was intended to be disallowed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary SQL Function Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute unauthorized SQL functions.
- **Potential Data Exposure or Modification:** While the provided example uses `RAND()`, this flaw could potentially be exploited to execute more damaging SQL commands, leading to unauthorized access to data, data modification, or even denial of service. The extent of the impact depends on the specific database permissions and available functions within that environment.
- **Unintended/Unexpected Behavior:** The specific example highlights the ability to use `RAND()`, which causes unpredictable data in returned results.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Special:CargoQuery Interface:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the `Special:CargoQuery` page, specifically by manipulating the `Field(s)` parameter of a user-defined query.
- **User-Supplied SQL:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL by inserting backticks and a function call, e.g.,  `IF(_pageNamespace = NULL, 'A', \`RAND\`())=out`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **MediaWiki User:** An attacker must have access to the `Special:CargoQuery` interface of a MediaWiki instance running the vulnerable version of the Cargo extension.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic knowledge of SQL is needed to craft malicious function calls within the query.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was implemented in commit `5e94b1625258` by looking for function calls inside backticks.
- The severity of the vulnerability was classified as "Low" due to the perceived lower risk.
- This issue affects Miraheze, which is also noted in the provided text.
