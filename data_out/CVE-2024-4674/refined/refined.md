Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `my_index` parameter within the `/view/show_friend_request.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS.  The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the web page. This allows them to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   Potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious website.
    *   Modify the content of the page, defacing the website.
    *   Download malware onto the user's system.
    *   Impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `my_index` parameter of the `/view/show_friend_request.php` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `my_index` parameter.
*   They would then need to lure a victim into visiting this URL, or find another method to have the victim's browser execute this malicious code.

**Payload Example:**

*   The provided payload is `my_index=my_index'"()%26%25<zzz><ScRiPt%20>alert(9203)</ScRiPt>`

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability exists in "Campcodes Complete Web-Based School Management System" version 1.0 and earlier.
* The vulnerability is located in the file `/view/show_friend_request.php`.
