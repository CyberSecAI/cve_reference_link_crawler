The provided content relates to CVE-2024-43847.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The monitor ring and the reo reinject ring in the ath12k driver share the same ring mask index.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- When the driver receives an interrupt for the reo reinject ring, the monitor ring is also processed.
- This leads to invalid memory access because monitor support is not fully enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Invalid memory access, which could lead to crashes, unpredictable behavior, or potential security vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by receiving an interrupt for the reo reinject ring in the ath12k driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to cause the driver to receive an interrupt for the reo reinject ring. This would likely require the ability to transmit packets or manipulate the network environment.
