- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations within the HTTP API service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability leading to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive information from the system. The attacker gains access to information in the context of the root user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack can be performed remotely through the HTTP API service on TCP port 443.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
