Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetDebugCfg` function of the Tenda G3V3.0 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formSetDebugCfg` function receives parameters `enable`, `level`, and `module` from a POST request, which are then used in an `sprintf` operation.
- The user-controlled input for these parameters is not properly validated, leading to a buffer overflow.
- Specifically, the `sprintf` function constructs a command string that is stored in a local `cmd` array. If the combined length of the user-supplied `enable`, `level`, and `module` exceeds the buffer capacity, a stack overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setDebugCfg` endpoint.
- The attacker controls the values of `enable`, `level`, and `module` parameters within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tenda router.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.

**Technical Details:**

- **Affected Firmware:** Tenda G3V3.0 V15.11.0.20
- **Vulnerable Function:** `formSetDebugCfg`
- **Vulnerable Code:**
```c
sprintf(
    (char *)cmd,
    "echo enable=%s level=%s > /var/debug/%s",
    (const char *)pEnable,
    (const char *)pLevel,
    (const char *)pModule);
```
- **Exploitation:** The provided PoC demonstrates sending a POST request to `/goform/setDebugCfg` with an overly long string in the `module` parameter:
```python
import requests
from pwn import*

ip = "192.168.84.101"
url = "http://" + ip + "/goform/setDebugCfg"
payload = b"a"*2000

data = {
        'module':payload,
    }
response = requests.post(url, data=data)
print(response.text)
```
