Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user input within the "SEO - Meta description" field in the Pages Menu of Quick CMS v6.7. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This occurs due to the application not properly sanitizing or encoding user-supplied data before storing it in the database and rendering it in web pages.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "SEO - Meta description" field within the Quick CMS admin panel. This stored payload is then executed when a user visits the page where the meta description is rendered.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the Quick CMS admin panel to modify the "SEO - Meta description" field. This means an attacker with administrative or content editing privileges can exploit this vulnerability.
