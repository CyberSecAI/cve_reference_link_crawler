{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Diebold Nixdorf ProCash 2100xe USB ATMs running Wincor Probase version 1.1.30 do not encrypt, authenticate, or verify the integrity of messages between the CCDM (cash and check deposit module) and the host computer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of encryption of communications between the CCDM and the host.",
      "Lack of authentication of communications between the CCDM and the host.",
      "Lack of integrity verification of communications between the CCDM and the host."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access can intercept and modify messages, such as the amount and value of currency being deposited. This could be used to commit deposit forgery, where the attacker makes an initial deposit of a small amount, modifies the messages to indicate a higher value, and then withdraws the increased amount.",
    "attack_vectors": "Physical access to the internal components of the ATM, allowing interception and modification of communications between the CCDM and the host computer.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs physical access to the internal components of the ATM to intercept and modify messages. They also need the technical ability to modify the message content."
