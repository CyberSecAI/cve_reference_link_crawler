## Diebold Nixdorf ProCash 2100xe USB ATM does not adequately secure communications between CCDM and host

#### Vulnerability Note VU#221785

Original Release Date: 2020-08-20 | Last Revised: 2020-08-24

---

### Overview

Diebold Nixdorf 2100xe USB automated teller machines (ATMs) are vulnerable to physical attacks on the communication channel between the cash and check deposit module (CCDM) and the host computer. An attacker with physical access to internal ATM components may be able to exploit this vulnerability to commit deposit forgery.

### Description

Diebold Nixdorf ProCash 2100xe USB ATMs running Wincor Probase version 1.1.30 do not encrypt, authenticate, or verify the integrity of messages between the CCDM and the host computer. An attacker with physical access to internal ATM components can intercept and modify messages, such as the amount and value of currency being deposited, and send modified messages to the host computer.

A similar vulnerability identified as [CVE-2020-10124](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail?vulnId=2020-10124) is decribed in [VU#815655](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815655). CVE-2020-10124 affects the bunch note acceptor (BNA) in ATMs supplied by a different vendor. The BNA is functionally similar to the CCDM.

### Impact

By modifying deposit transaction messages, an attacker may be able to commit deposit forgery. Such an attack requires two separate transactions. The attacker must first deposit actual currency and modify messages from the CCDM to the host computer to indicate a greater amount or value than was actually deposited. Then the attacker must make a withdrawal for an artificially increased amount or value of currency. This second transaction may need to occur at an ATM operated by a different financial institution (i.e., a not-on-us or OFF-US transaction).

### Solution

#### Obtain advice from vendor

Diebold Nixdorf released a document titled "Potential CCDM Deposit Forgery" on February 27, 2020 that details the recommended procedures for addressing this vulnerability. Contact the vendor to obtain the document.

#### Apply an update

The vendor has released an update to secure communications between the CCDM and the host computer. Contact the vendor regarding this software update.

#### Consider additional countermeasures

In addition to applying a software update, the vendor recommends limiting physical access to the ATM (including internal components), adjusting deposit transaction business logic, and implementing fraud monitoring. For details about these additional recommended countermeasures, contact the vendor.
