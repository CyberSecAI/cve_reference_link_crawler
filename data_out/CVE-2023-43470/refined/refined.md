Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `checklogin.php` file of the Online Voting System. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `checklogin.php` script directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Data Breach: Accessing or modifying sensitive information in the database (e.g., user credentials, voting records).
    *   Denial of Service: Disrupting the system's operation.
    *   Complete System Compromise: Depending on database privileges, the attacker may gain control over the server or underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP request to the `checklogin.php` file.
*   **Login Form:** The username and password fields in the login form are used to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** Basic understanding of SQL syntax is needed to craft the injection payload.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in the login process, so the attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to inject SQL code into the username field of the login form.
*   The POC uses a `SLEEP()` function to verify the SQL injection is successful via a time-based attack.
*   The SQLMap results confirm that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   The vulnerable code snippet (from the Github repo's README) shows the `username` parameter is directly inserted into a query.

```php
$myusername=$_POST['myusername'];
$mypassword=$_POST['mypassword'];

$sql="SELECT * FROM $tbl_name WHERE username='$myusername' and password='$mypassword'";
```
**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including a POC, code snippets, and SQLMap results.
*   The vulnerable product is the Online Voting System v1.0
*   The vulnerable component is the `checklogin.php` file.
