Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-10018

**Vulnerable Software:** Mapplic and Mapplic Lite WordPress plugins (versions <= 6.1 and 1.0, respectively)

**Root Cause:** The plugins are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). They load SVG files by making a request to a URL provided by the user without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugins allow an attacker to specify a URL from which to load an SVG map. This enables the attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By using the SSRF vulnerability, an attacker can point the plugin to a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript. Because the plugin then includes the content of the SVG into the page, the JavaScript is executed by the client browser, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can use the SSRF to make requests from the server. This could be used to scan internal networks or interact with services not directly accessible to the public.
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a website through an SVG file using SSRF, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This can result in cookie stealing, session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a crafted request to the WordPress plugin that specifies a malicious URL for an SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated (Public access).
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided patch information shows that the fix involved sanitizing the loaded SVG content to remove any `<script>` tags to prevent XSS.
*   The vulnerability was present in Mapplic versions up to 6.1, and in Mapplic Lite versions up to 1.0. The patched versions are 6.2 and 1.0.1 respectively.
