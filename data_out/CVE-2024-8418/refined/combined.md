## Description

![@czarnas](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161315?v=4&size=48)[czarnas](https://github.com/czarnas)opened [on Aug 28, 2024](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns/issues/500#issue-2491661448)
### Issue Description

The issue I have is that my podman containers stops resolving internal & external DNS after some time ~1h.

If I restart whole podman or reboot system I can resolve all of the dns records and ping between containers or external network.

After ~1h I can no longer resolve dns, or ping between containers, or outside network.

I'm running named bridge network.

**Issue started to show up after upgrade from podman 5:5.1.2-1.fc40 -> 5:5.2.1-1.fc40 & maybe what's most important netavark 1.11.0-1.fc40 -> 2:1.12.1-1.fc40

aardvark-dns 1.11.0-1.fc40 -> 2:1.12.1-1.fc40**

### Steps to reproduce the issue

Steps to reproduce the issue

1. Start the system
2. compose up containers
3. after ~1h no longer able to ping between containers

### Describe the results you received

Right after container start:

```
DNS Check:
root@ca958a38fca0:/# nslookup gitea
Server:         10.89.0.1

Non-authoritative answer:

```

After 1h

```
root@f7e795eac0a0:/# nslookup gitea
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

root@f7e795eac0a0:/# ping google.com
ping: bad address 'google.com'

```

Journalctl contains following entries:

### @Luap99 **[Luap99](/Luap99)** commented [Sep 2, 2024](#issue-2500891386)

Right now for a single network all requests where processed serial and

with tcp a caller is able to block us for a long time if it just opens

the connection but sends very little or no data. To avoid this always

spawn a new task if we accept a new tcp connection.

We could do the same for udp however my testing with contrib/perf/run.sh

has shown that it slows things down as the overhead of spawning a task

is greater than the few quick simple map lookups so we only spawn where

needed. We still have to spawn when forwarding external requests as this

can take a long time.

Fixes [#500](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns/issues/500)

Add a 3s timeout to all tcp connections, we do not want clients to keep
the connections open forever. Also do not allow more than one message
per connection.

The API is a bit weird, we first get the message then have to poll again
where it return None otherwise the reply will not be send.
