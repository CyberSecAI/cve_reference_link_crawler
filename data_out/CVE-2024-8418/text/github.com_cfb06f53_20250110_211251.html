### @Luap99 **[Luap99](/Luap99)** commented [Sep 2, 2024](#issue-2500891386)

Right now for a single network all requests where processed serial and

with tcp a caller is able to block us for a long time if it just opens

the connection but sends very little or no data. To avoid this always

spawn a new task if we accept a new tcp connection.

We could do the same for udp however my testing with contrib/perf/run.sh

has shown that it slows things down as the overhead of spawning a task

is greater than the few quick simple map lookups so we only spawn where

needed. We still have to spawn when forwarding external requests as this

can take a long time.

Fixes [#500](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns/issues/500)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Add a 3s timeout to all tcp connections, we do not want clients to keep
the connections open forever. Also do not allow more than one message
per connection.

The API is a bit weird, we first get the message then have to poll again
where it return None otherwise the reply will not be send.
