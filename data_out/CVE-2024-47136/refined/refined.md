Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read when processing some incorrect PLC instructions within project files. This occurs when a specially crafted project file, saved with Kostac PLC Programming Software version 1.6.9.0 or earlier, is opened by the software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125): The software reads data from a memory location outside the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker may be able to read sensitive information from memory.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Although not explicitly stated for this specific CVE, the associated vulnerabilities include DoS and Arbitrary Code Execution, indicating a potential for DoS through out-of-bounds reads as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted project file (KPP file) that was saved using Kostac PLC Programming Software version 1.6.9.0 or earlier.
- The user must open the malicious project file with a vulnerable version of the software (1.6.14.0 or earlier)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious project file (KPP) and have it opened by a user of the vulnerable Kostac PLC Programming Software. No special privileges are needed since it is a user-initiated action.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the project files (.kpp files), specifically when processing incorrect PLC instructions.
- The vendor has released version 1.6.15.0 or later which addresses this issue.
- Project files saved using version 1.6.9.0 or earlier should be re-saved using version 1.6.10.0 or later to enable the tamper-proof feature.
