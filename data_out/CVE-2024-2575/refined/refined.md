Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an authorization flaw in the `/task-details.php` file of the SourceCodester Employee Task Management System 1.0. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate user authorization when accessing task details based on the `task_id` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control. An attacker can manipulate the `task_id` parameter in the URL to access task details that belong to other users, without requiring authentication. This is an instance of CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).
    *   **Improper Authorization:** The system's authorization mechanism is flawed, failing to prevent users from accessing resources they are not supposed to view. This relates to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and potentially CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment).
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to task details can expose sensitive information.
    *   **Integrity Violation:** An attacker could potentially modify task information or manipulate data belonging to another user.
    *   **Availability Issues:** The vulnerability may allow for disruption or denial of service, although this is less emphasized.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** The attack can be launched remotely.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication, making it easily exploitable.
    *   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the `task_id` parameter in the URL to access other users' task details.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
    *   The attacker needs to know the format of the `task_id` and how to manipulate it.

**Additional Information:**
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
*   The vulnerability is easily exploitable.
*   The vulnerability can be discovered through Google Hacking by searching for `inurl:task-details.php`.
*   There are no known countermeasures, suggesting that patching or replacing the vulnerable system is necessary.
