```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `decodePwd` function in Tenda FH1201 firmware is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function copies the user-controlled `pptpPPW` parameter from a POST request into a local buffer without proper bounds checking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to lack of bounds checking when copying user-provided input to a fixed-size buffer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially overwrite adjacent stack memory, leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/AdvSetWan` endpoint with the `wanmode` set to '3' and a long string as the `pptpPPW` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Tenda FH1201 device. This likely requires network access to the device and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint."
