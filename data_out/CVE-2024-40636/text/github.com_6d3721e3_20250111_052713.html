## Description

### Summary

When utilizing multiple Eureka server service URLs with basic auth and encountering an issue with fetching the service registry, an error is logged with the Eureka server service URLs but only the first URL is masked.

### Details

Package: Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka

Package version: 3.2.1

Branch: "release/3.2"

File name: `DiscoveryClient.cs`

Line number: 325

Code in question: `_logger.LogError(e, "FetchRegistry Failed for Eureka service urls: {EurekaServerServiceUrls}", new Uri(ClientConfig.EurekaServerServiceUrls).ToMaskedString());`

Error message in logs: `FetchRegistry Failed for Eureka service urls: https://****:****@eureka1.com:443/eureka,https://user:password@eureka2.com:443/eureka`

I thought `new Uri(clientOptions.EurekaServerServiceUrls)` would throw a `UriFormatException` since there are multiple URLs but my logs are showing two URLs regardless.

### PoC

1. Set Eureka config with multiple server URLs with basic auth
2. Apologies for not being more descriptive for this step, but I believe we would just need to trigger an exception in `FetchFullRegistryAsync`.
3. Check the logs and should see the error

### Impact

Vulnerability: Credential leakage in the logs

Who does it impact?: Users who are using peer awareness with Spring Eureka

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-40636

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
