- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a use-of-uninitialized-pointer in the `Forward Open connection_management_entry` functionality. Specifically, when processing a `LargeForwardOpen` request, the `remaining_path` variable is set to the value of `connection_path_size` directly from the request. If the `connection_path_size` is set to `0x00` and no connection path is provided, parsing is bypassed but the code execution continues.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Use of an uninitialized pointer: The `g_connection_management_list` is initialized with null bytes, but these entries are not overwritten with a valid connection function when no connection path is given in the request and no valid connection is established. The code then tries to dereference the uninitialized function pointer from this list leading to a crash.
    - Lack of input validation: The code does not properly validate the `remaining_path` variable, or ensure that a valid connection management entry exists before attempting to call the `open_connection_function`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a server crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted EtherNet/IP request with a connection path size set to 0x00 and no connection path provided.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send EtherNet/IP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is required.
