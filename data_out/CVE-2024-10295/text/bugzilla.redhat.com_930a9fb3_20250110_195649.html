Sending a non-base64 'basic' auth with special characters can cause APICast to incorrectly authenticate a request. A malformed basic authentication header containing special characters bypasses authentication and allows unauthorized access to the backend. This issue can occur due to a failure in the base64 decoding process, which causes APICast to skip the rest of the authentication checks and proceed with routing the request upstream. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2321258#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-23 10:27:26 UTC  ``` When a request contains an invalid base64-encoded header (e.g., Authorization: Basic 1234?), APICast does not properly handle the decoding failure. Instead, it skips the remaining authentication steps and processes the request, allowing unauthorized access to the backend service. This can lead to potential security risks as unverified requests are processed by the backend.   ``` |  |
