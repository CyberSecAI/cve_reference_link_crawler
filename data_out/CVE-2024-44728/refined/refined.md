Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Sourcecodehero Event Management System 1.0. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the `Full Name`, `Address`, `Email`, and `contact#` parameters in `/clientdetails/admin/register.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it stores unsanitized input in the database, which is then displayed back to users without proper encoding, allowing execution of injected scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Execution of arbitrary script code:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they view the affected page.
- **Theft of cookie-based authentication credentials:** Attackers can use the injected script to steal session cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
- **Potential for further attacks:** This can include data manipulation and other malicious activities within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface of the application, specifically within the admin panel at `/clientdetails/admin/register.php`.
- **Form submission:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable parameters by submitting a form via the user interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Event Management System. This is required to access the `/clientdetails/admin/register.php` page where the vulnerable parameters are located.
- **Ability to manipulate web forms:** The attacker needs to be able to fill the form parameters with a malicious payload.

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof of concept uses a simple JavaScript payload (`<ScRiPt>confirm(document.cookie)</ScRiPt>`) to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability, which causes an alert box to pop up, displaying the user's cookie information.
- The vulnerability is persistent; the XSS payload is stored in the database and triggers each time the data is loaded.
