# Exploit Report: Sourcecodehero Event Management System 1.0 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting

* **Exploit Title:** Sourcecodehero Event Management System 1.0 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
* **Date:** 13-08-2024
* **Exploit Author:** Aslam Anwar Mahimkar
* **Vendor Homepage:** [sourcecodehero.com](https://sourcecodehero.com/)
* **Software Link:** [Event Management System Project](https://sourcecodehero.com/event-management-system-project-in-php-and-mysql-with-source-code/)
* **Version:** 1.0
* **Tested On:** Kali Linux
* **CVE:** CVE-2024-44728

## Description

The Sourcecodehero Event Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via parameters `Full Name`, `Address`, `Email`, and `contact#` in `/clientdetails/admin/register.php`. The system fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary script code. This can result in the execution of the script in the browser of an unsuspecting user, which may lead to the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.

## Proof of Concept

1. **Access the Admin Panel:**

   * Navigate to: <http://localhost/event/admin/>
2. **Log In:**

   * Use the credentials: `admin:client123`
3. **Navigate to Create Users:**

   * Go to: <http://localhost/event/admin/index.php?page=audience>
4. **Submit the XSS Payload:**

   * Fill the form parameters `Full Name`, `Address`, `Email`, and `contact#` with the payload:
     ```
     ><ScRiPt>confirm(document.cookie)</ScRiPt>h0la
     ```
   * Save the form.
5. **Verify the XSS:**

   * Refresh the page and observe that the alert with the cookie data continues to pop up, indicating that the XSS is triggered permanently.

## Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

* Execution of arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site.
* Theft of cookie-based authentication credentials.
* Potential for further attacks such as session hijacking or data manipulation.

## Recommendations

* **Sanitize User Inputs:** Ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated to prevent XSS attacks.
* **Implement Output Encoding:** Use proper output encoding mechanisms to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
