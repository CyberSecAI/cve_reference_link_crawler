## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Food Manager < 1.0.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Food manager > Add Food" and add an example food
2. Edit the added food and go to Food data -> options / Add ons / Toppings -> Add the following XSS payload: `test"><img src=x onerror=confirm(document.domain)>` and fill out the other fields
3. Publish the food, you will see an XSS got triggered
