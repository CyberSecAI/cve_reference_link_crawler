- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high-privilege user (admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed when other users access the affected page.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1.  Navigate to "Food manager > Add Food".
    2.  Add an example food item.
    3.  Edit the food item, and in "Food data -> options / Add ons / Toppings", inject an XSS payload such as `test"><img src=x onerror=confirm(document.domain)>`.
    4. Publish the food item, which will trigger the XSS when viewed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have admin-level privileges.
