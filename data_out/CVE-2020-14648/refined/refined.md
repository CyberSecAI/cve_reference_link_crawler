  "vulnerability": "CVE-2020-14648",
  "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the lsilogicRegisterWrite function. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Oracle VirtualBox versions prior to 5.2.44, prior to 6.0.24, prior to 6.1.12",
    "openSUSE Leap 15.1",
    "openSUSE Leap 15.2",
    "Gentoo app-emulation/virtualbox versions < 6.1.12"
