The Tickera â€“ WordPress Event Ticketing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the tc_dl_delete_tickets AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete all tickets associated with events.
