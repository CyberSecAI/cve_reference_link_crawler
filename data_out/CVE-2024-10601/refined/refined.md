Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `$where_repeat` parameter in the `general/address/private/address/query/delete.php` file within Tongda OA. This parameter is directly used in a SQL query without sufficient sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. By manipulating the `$where_repeat` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and application data.
- The attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- Depending on the database user's privileges, the attacker might even be able to gain control of the server.
- In the provided exploit, the attacker is seen extracting the name of the database `td_oa`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `delete.php` endpoint.
- The attack vector involves manipulating the `where_repeat` query parameter in the URL.
- The attacker doesn't appear to need to be authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Tongda OA application.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to construct malicious SQL payloads for the `$where_repeat` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub issue includes proof-of-concept exploit attempts demonstrating how to inject SQL code and extract data.
- The vulnerable software is identified as Beijing Tongda Xinke Technology Co., Ltd Tongda OA v2017-v11.10.
- The attacker can perform blind SQL injection by checking the database name by using `substr(DATABASE(),x,1)`
