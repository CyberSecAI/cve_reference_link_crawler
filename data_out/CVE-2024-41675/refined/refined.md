Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Datatables view plugin in CKAN did not properly escape record data retrieved from the DataStore.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically, stored XSS. The plugin displayed data without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing malicious code to be injected and executed within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the DataStore, which would then be executed when a user views the data via the Datatables view plugin. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Due to the high impact on confidentiality, an attacker could potentially access sensitive information that the user has access to.
*   **Integrity Issues:** Although the provided CVSS score indicates no impact on integrity, a successful XSS attack could allow the attacker to modify displayed content on the web page, affecting the integrity of the user's view.
*   **Availability Issues:** The CVSS score indicates no impact on availability, however, a successful XSS attack could disrupt the user's experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges to exploit this vulnerability. This likely refers to the ability to upload or modify data in the DataStore.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required because the user must view the page with the malicious data displayed via the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Data Modification/Upload:** An attacker needs to be able to insert malicious content into the DataStore, which is then retrieved by the application and rendered in a vulnerable manner.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in CKAN versions >=2.7.0.
*   The issue is resolved in versions 2.10.5 and 2.11.0
*   The fix involved escaping the data using `html.escape` before rendering it in the datatables view.
*   A workaround involves preventing the import of tabular data from untrusted sources.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
