The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44391.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cgiserver.cgi` program in Reolink RLC-410W IP cameras does not properly validate the JSON input for the "param" field in various API commands. Specifically, the code assumes the "param" value will always be a JSON object, and attempts to use the subscription operator on it. When it receives a non-object value, like an empty string, it leads to an assertion failure and causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash, ultimately rebooting the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The program fails to check the type of the "param" value before attempting to parse it as a JSON object.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The assertion failure leads to the termination of the `cgiserver.cgi` process, which results in a device reboot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause the camera to reboot by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an invalid "param" value, disrupting the camera's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- The request must include a JSON body where the `param` field in the "GetEnc" command is an empty string or other non-object JSON value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera.
- While some of the vulnerabilities listed require an authenticated user, the vulnerability can be triggered without authentication using another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420), making the impact greater.
