Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3244

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `restore_settings` function within the "Comments Like Dislike" WordPress plugin. This function is accessible via an AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `restore_settings` function lacks a proper capability check, allowing users with minimal permissions (like subscribers) to execute it.
- **Insecure AJAX Action:** The AJAX action `cld_settings_restore_action` is not properly restricted to authorized users only.
- **Partial Patching:** While the nonce was present, it was still accessible to subscriber-level users (as noted, this was partially patched in version 1.2.0, but the nonce was still present to subscriber level users).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can reset the plugin's settings to their default values by exploiting the missing authorization, potentially causing unwanted changes or disruption to site functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an AJAX call to the `cld_settings_restore_action` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (at least a subscriber) to make the request.
- The attacker does not need to trick an admin into performing an action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- The attacker must be able to craft and send an AJAX request to the vulnerable endpoint.
