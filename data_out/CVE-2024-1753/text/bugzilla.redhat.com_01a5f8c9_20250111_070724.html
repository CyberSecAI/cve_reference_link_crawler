| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2265513#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2024-02-22 14:04:16 UTC  ``` When performing bind mounts as part of a build-time RUN step, the ‘source’ argument is not validated to ensure that it exists within the root filesystem. A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image with a symbolic link to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operation to mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands inside the RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem, allowing for full container escape at build time.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2265513#c4)  Anten Skrabec    2024-03-18 14:12:17 UTC  ``` Created buildah tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2270125](show_bug.cgi?id=2270125 "CLOSED EOL -
