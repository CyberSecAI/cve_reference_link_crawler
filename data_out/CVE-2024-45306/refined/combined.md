# heap-buffer-overflow in Vim >= 9.1.0038 and Vim < 9.1.0707

Moderate

[chrisbra](/chrisbra)
published
GHSA-wxf9-c5gx-qrwr
Sep 1, 2024

## Package

vim

## Affected versions

all versions between v9.1.0038 and v9.1.0706

## Patched versions

v9.1.0707

## Description

# heap-buffer-overflow in Vim >= 9.1.0038 and Vim < 9.1.0707

**Date**: 31.08.2024

**Severity**: Low

**CVE**: CVE-2024-45306

**CWE**: Heap-based buffer overlow (CWE-122)

### Summary

a heap-buffer overflow was found in Vim.

### Impact

Patch [v9.1.0038](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v9.1.0038) optimized how the cursor position is calculated and

removed a loop, that verified that the cursor position always points

inside a line and does not become invalid by pointing beyond the end of

a line. Back then we assumed this loop is unnecessary.

However, this change made it possible that the cursor position stays

invalid and points beyond the end of a line, which would eventually

cause a heap-buffer-overflow when trying to access the line pointer at

the specified cursor position.

It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation that the cursor

points to an invalid position. That's why patch v9.1.0707 does not

include a test case.

Impact is low since we have only seen a crash when feeding some fuzzy

generated files at Vim and not during a real editing session. However

this may lead to a crash.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting

this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0707

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

patch 9.1.0707: [security]: invalid cursor position may cause a crash

Problem:  [security]: invalid cursor position may cause a crash
          (after v9.1.0038)
Solution: Set cursor to the last character in a line, if it would
          otherwise point to beyond the line; no tests added, as it
          is unclear how to reproduce this.
