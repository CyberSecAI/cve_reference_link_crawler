patch 9.1.0707: [security]: invalid cursor position may cause a crash

```
Problem:  [security]: invalid cursor position may cause a crash
          (after v9.1.0038)
Solution: Set cursor to the last character in a line, if it would
          otherwise point to beyond the line; no tests added, as it
          is unclear how to reproduce this.
