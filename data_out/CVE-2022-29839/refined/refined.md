- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient protection of credentials in the Remote Backups application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Credentials for the remote backups application are not encrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to a relevant endpoint can use the exposed credentials to access protected data.
- **Attack vectors:** Gaining access to the endpoint where the credentials are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to gain access to the endpoint where the remote backups credentials are stored.
