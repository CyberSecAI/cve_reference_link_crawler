```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Incomplete cleanup of WebSocket connections leading to resource exhaustion.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to a failure to properly close WebSocket connections.
  - Impact of exploitation: Attackers can cause a Denial of Service by keeping WebSocket connections open, leading to increased resource consumption on the server.
  - Attack vectors: Sending incomplete WebSocket closing handshakes
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to be able to establish WebSocket connections with the vulnerable server.
