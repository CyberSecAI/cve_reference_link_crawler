Package        : tomcat9

CVE ID         : CVE-2024-23672 CVE-2024-24549
Debian Bug     : 1066877 1066878

Two security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.

CVE-2024-24549

     Denial of Service due to improper input validation vulnerability for
     HTTP/2. When processing an HTTP/2 request, if the request exceeded any of
     the configured limits for headers, the associated HTTP/2 stream was not
     reset until after all of the headers had been processed.

CVE-2024-23672

     Denial of Service via incomplete cleanup vulnerability. It was possible
     for WebSocket clients to keep WebSocket connections open leading to
     increased resource consumption.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
9.0.31-1~deb10u12.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.
