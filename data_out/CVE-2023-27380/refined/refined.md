The provided content is related to CVE-2023-27380.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `USSD_send` function within the `admin.cgi` file. This function constructs and executes a command using the `popen` function. The `ussd_code` parameter from an HTTP POST request is directly injected into the command string without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The primary weakness is the direct injection of the attacker-controlled `ussd_code` parameter into the command string, which allows for arbitrary command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected device. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device, allowing the attacker to:
- Gain full control over the device
- Exfiltrate sensitive information
- Disrupt the deviceâ€™s normal operations

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi` endpoint.
- The request must include the `section` parameter set to `USSD_send`.
- The `ussd_code` parameter is the entry point for the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated as a user with write privileges on the device to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- The device must have a functioning GSM module for the vulnerable code path to be reached.
