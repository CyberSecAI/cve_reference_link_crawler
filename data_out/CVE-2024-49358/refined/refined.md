- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The API endpoint `/v1/users/login` in ZimaOS returns different responses depending on whether a username exists or the password is incorrect.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Username enumeration vulnerability due to distinct error messages for invalid usernames vs. incorrect passwords.
    - The API returns `User does not exist` when the username doesn't exist, and `User does not exist or password is invalid` when the username exists but the password is wrong.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - User enumeration, allowing attackers to collect valid usernames for further attacks.
    - Enables targeted attacks like password brute-forcing, credential stuffing, and phishing.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending POST requests to the `/v1/users/login` endpoint with various usernames and incorrect passwords, then comparing the responses to see if the username exists.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access to the ZimaOS server.
    - Ability to send HTTP POST requests.
