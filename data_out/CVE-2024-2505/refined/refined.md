Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Broken Access Control in GamiPress WordPress plugin

**Root Cause:** The plugin's access control mechanism does not properly restrict access to settings, allowing lower-privileged users to manipulate requests and gain unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is that the plugin fails to enforce proper access control, which allows users to bypass intended permission settings.
*   **Inferred Parameter Values:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating request parameters based on inferred user role capabilities (e.g., 'manage_options' for Administrator, 'publish_posts' for Author).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Modification of Plugin Settings:** Attackers with lower privileges (e.g., Author) can manipulate the plugin settings, potentially leading to unwanted modifications or disruptions.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Users with minimal access (e.g., Subscribers) can gain the ability to change plugin settings that should only be accessible to higher-level users by manipulating requests, effectively escalating their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests, modifying parameters to bypass access controls and perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the vulnerable WordPress site, even with lower privileges such as Author, Contributor or Subscriber.
*   **Knowledge of Request Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the parameters used by the plugin to modify settings and the corresponding role capabilities associated with these parameters to bypass the access controls.
