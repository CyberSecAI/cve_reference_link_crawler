- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access to the debug panel through the GLPI update script (`install/update.php`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An authenticated user with low privileges can access the debug panel through the update script, which is not intended for general use.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can gain access to the debug panel, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionality intended for debugging purposes.
- **Attack vectors**: Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a connected user (authenticated) with low privileges. No user interaction is needed.
