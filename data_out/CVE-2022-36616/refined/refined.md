{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TOTOLINK A810R router firmware contains a hardcoded root password in the `/etc/shadow.sample` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded password vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain root access to the device by using the hardcoded password.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to access the `/etc/shadow.sample` file, which is part of the firmware. The method to get access to the firmware is not stated in the document.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to either have access to the device's file system directly, or extract the firmware from the provided download link, and be able to decrypt the password."
