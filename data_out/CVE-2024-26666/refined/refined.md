The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26666.

**Root cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the mac80211 subsystem of the Linux kernel, specifically within the TDLS (Tunneled Direct Link Setup) fast-transmit functionality. The code looks up the link under RCU (Read-Copy-Update) protection but does not guarantee that it actually has the protection in place.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
The code accesses `sdata->link[tdls_link_id]` using `rcu_dereference` within an RCU read lock but doesn't properly handle the case where `link` may be NULL or invalid, possibly due to concurrent modifications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is not explicitly mentioned, but a NULL or invalid pointer dereference could lead to a kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered when using the TDLS fast-transmit feature in mac80211. This involves sending TDLS data frames which would cause a lookup of the link ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be in a position to influence the TDLS connection and trigger the vulnerable code path. This would involve being on the same network and interacting via TDLS protocol with a vulnerable access point/device.
