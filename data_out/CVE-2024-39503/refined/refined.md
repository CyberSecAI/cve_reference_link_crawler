  "CVE-2024-39503": {
    "description": "Lion Ackermann reported that there is a race condition between namespace cleanup in ipset and the garbage collection of the list:set type. The namespace cleanup can destroy the list:set type of sets while the gc of the set type is waiting to run in rcu cleanup. The latter uses data from the destroyed set which thus leads use after free.",

      "Use-after-free",
      "Race Condition"

      "Namespace cleanup",
