- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leak
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, user interaction required. The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` which means:
    -   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local) - The vulnerability can be exploited when the attacker has local access to the system.
    -   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low) - The attack is relatively easy to perform.
    -   **PR:N** (Privileges Required: None) - No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
    -   **UI:R** (User Interaction: Required) - User interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
    -   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged) - The vulnerability affects only the vulnerable component.
    -   **C:H** (Confidentiality: High) - There is a high impact on confidentiality, specifically the attacker can obtain sensitive information through memory leak.
    -   **I:N** (Integrity: None) - There is no impact on integrity.
    -   **A:N** (Availability: None) - There is no impact on availability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and must induce the user to perform an action that triggers the vulnerability.
