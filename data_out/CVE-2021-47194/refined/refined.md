Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing cleanup call to `cfg80211_stop_ap()` when switching a network interface from P2P Group Owner (P2P_GO) mode to Ad-Hoc mode. Specifically, when userspace tools use `send_msg(NL80211_CMD_SET_INTERFACE)` to change an interface from `NL80211_IFTYPE_P2P_GO` to `NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC`, the `cfg80211_stop_ap()` function, which is responsible for cleaning up the AP-related data, is not called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Cleanup:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a call to `cfg80211_stop_ap()` during the interface mode switch.
*   **Data Re-initialization:**  Due to the missing cleanup, data structures associated with the previous P2P_GO interface, such as `sdata->assigned_chanctx_list`, are re-initialized while they are still part of other data structures (`assigned_vifs`), leading to a corrupted linked list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Linked List Corruption:** The main impact is corruption of the linked list of assigned virtual interfaces (VIFs), which can lead to system instability, crashes, or unexpected behavior.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, linked list corruption can sometimes lead to other memory-related vulnerabilities that could be exploited for more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Userspace Interface Mode Change:** The attack vector involves a user space application using netlink to change the interface type from P2P_GO to ADHOC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Userspace Control:** The attacker needs the ability to use netlink sockets to send `NL80211_CMD_SET_INTERFACE` commands. This usually requires some level of access to the system, but not necessarily root privileges depending on the system's setup.

**More Details than the CVE Description:**

The provided content gives detailed information regarding the following:
* The exact scenario and code path that leads to the issue, i.e. switching from NL80211_IFTYPE_P2P_GO to NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC using `send_msg(NL80211_CMD_SET_INTERFACE)`.
* The specific data structures affected by the missing cleanup call, i.e., `sdata->assigned_chanctx_list` and its relation to the `assigned_vifs` list.
* The specific function that was not being called leading to the vulnerability, `cfg80211_stop_ap()`.

In summary, the vulnerability is caused by a missing cleanup call in the cfg80211 subsystem of the Linux kernel, triggered by a specific interface mode change, which results in linked list corruption, potentially leading to system instability.
