Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0828

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Missing authorization checks on multiple AJAX functions within the `class-ajax-handler.php` file of the Play.ht WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user initiating the AJAX requests has the necessary privileges to perform the requested actions. This lack of access control is the core weakness.
- Specifically, the following actions are vulnerable:
    - Deleting, retrieving, or modifying post metadata.
    - Retrieving the contents of protected posts.
    - Modifying conversion data.
    - Deleting article audio.
- The vulnerable functions include, but are not limited to:
    - `get_post_content_data`
    - `save_post_conversion_data`
    - `article_converted_success`
    - `save_draft`
    - `delete_draft`
    - `delete_article_audio`
    - `retry_article_audio`
    - `refresh_audio_menu`
    - `refresh_action_rows`
    - `article_converted_failed`
    - `retrieve_user_data`
    - `retrieve_article_enable`
    - `retrieve_default_voice`
    - `retrieve_post_meta_data`
    - `playht_set_user_data`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify post metadata, potentially altering how posts are displayed or behave.
- **Content Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve content from protected posts, bypassing intended access restrictions.
- **Audio Control:** Attackers can delete article audio, disrupting the intended functionality of the plugin.
- **Service Disruption:** Attackers can disrupt the normal conversion process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through AJAX requests to the vulnerable functions. These actions are triggered by sending HTTP POST requests to the WordPress AJAX endpoint (`wp_ajax_*`) with the corresponding action parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in WordPress user with at least subscriber-level access. This means they do not need administrative privileges, making the vulnerability easier to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.6.4.
- There is no known patch available, meaning users of affected versions are vulnerable.
