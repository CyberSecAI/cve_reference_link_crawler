## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Paid Memberships Pro - Member Directory Add On < 1.2.6 - Contributor+ Sensitive Information Disclosure and SQLi

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users with at least the contributor role from leaking other users' sensitive information, including password hashes.

### Proof of Concept

1. ADMIN: Install Paid Memberships Pro
2. ADMIN: Install Paid Memberships Pro Member Directory Add On
3. CONTRIBUTOR: Add shortcode to any post and save
4. CONTRIBUTOR: Preview the post and see list of all users for a site ordered by user level descending and see it lists sensitive user information including user level, password hashes, and activation keys (used for pw resets)
5. ANYONE: If the post/page ends up being published with the shortcode, anyone without authentication can see the exposed details
Example shortcode: `[pmpro\_member\_directory fields="Password hash,user\_pass;Login,user\_login;User activiation key,user\_activation\_key;User ID,ID;User level,wp\_user\_level" levels="0) OR (1=1" order\_by="1=1," order="CAST( ( SELECT meta\_value FROM wp\_usermeta WHERE user\_id = u.ID AND meta\_key = \x27wp\_user\_level\x27 ) AS SIGNED ) DESC"]`
1. ADMIN: Install Paid Memberships Pro
2. ADMIN: Install Paid Memberships Pro Member Directory Add On
3. CONTRIBUTOR: Add shortcode to any post and specify/guess a user ID and save
4. CONTRIBUTOR: Preview the post and see it render sensitive user information including user level, password hashes, and activation keys (used for pw resets)
5. ANYONE: If the post/page ends up being published with the shortcode, anyone without authentication can see the exposed details
Example shortcode: `[pmpro\_member\_profile fields="Password hash,user\_pass;Login,user\_login;User activiation key,user\_activation\_key;User ID,ID;User level,wp\_user\_level" user\_id="1"]`
