- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of malformed HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the FortiADC's failure to properly handle malformed HTTP requests, which allows for the bypass of Web Application Firewall (WAF) protections. Specifically, SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filters can be circumvented.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the bypass of WAF protections, potentially allowing an attacker to inject SQL queries, execute arbitrary code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**:  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FortiADC instance. No specific privileges are required.
