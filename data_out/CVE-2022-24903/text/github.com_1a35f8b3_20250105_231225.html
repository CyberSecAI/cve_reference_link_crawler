# Potential heap buffer overflow in TCP syslog server (receiver) components

High

[rgerhards](/rgerhards)
published
GHSA-ggw7-xr6h-mmr8
May 5, 2022

## Package

rsyslog
(syslog)

## Affected versions

<= 8.2204.0

## Patched versions

8.2204.1

## Description

### Impact

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. The attacker can corrupt heap values, leading to data integrity issues and availability impact. Remote code execution is unlikely to happen but not impossible.

### Affected modules

* `imtcp`
* `imptcp`
* `imhttp` (contributed module)
* `imgssapi` (long-term semi-contributed module)
* `imdiag`

### Details

The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. This can also be used to corrupt other heap buffers. Once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex.

Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers.

Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower.

Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation.

### Patches

The patch is available via commit ID [PUT HERE].

### Workarounds

Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. How to do this depends on the module:

* For `imtcp`. `imptcp`, add `SupportOctetCountedFraming="off"` to the `input()` definition.

  Docs: <https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imtcp.html>, <https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imptcp.html>, <https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imhttp.html>
* For `imgssapi`octet.-counted framing cannot be turned off.
* For `imdiag` octect-counted framing cannot be turned off. However, `imdiag` should never be present on production systems.

Note that while octet-counted framing can be disabled sending systems have to explicitly enable it, but by default receiving systems autodetect if it's in use. The 'normal' reason to enable it is if you are sending logs with embedded newlines.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
