- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "@cosme" app fails to properly restrict access to a function that uses custom URL schemes. This allows the app to be directed to access arbitrary websites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints ([CWE-939](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/939.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can lead a user to access an arbitrary website through the vulnerable app. This can result in the user becoming a victim of a phishing attack.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious custom URL scheme.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice the user to click on the malicious custom URL scheme. No special privileges or local access is needed.
