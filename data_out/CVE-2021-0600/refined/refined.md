Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0600:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `CharSequence` interface in the Device Admin request screen. While `String` implements this interface, so does `Spanned`, which can store HTML code. This allows for the injection of HTML code into the device admin request screen, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the possibility of injecting HTML code through the `CharSequence` interface where a simple `String` was expected for a text message. The usage of `Spanned` objects allowed for the inclusion of HTML content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially alter the content of the Device Admin request screen by injecting arbitrary HTML. While the provided information does not specify the exact impact of the injected HTML, it could lead to user deception by modifying the text,  or potentially tricking the user into granting device admin privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local malicious application (as specified in the bulletin) that can craft a malicious payload containing HTML code in the `Spanned` object passed to the vulnerable component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. This application must be able to craft a `Spanned` object containing the malicious HTML payload.

**Additional details from the provided commit:**
- The fix involves enforcing the usage of `String` type instead of `CharSequence`. By explicitly using `String`, the possibility of including HTML function through `Spanned` is eliminated.
- The provided commit message mentions the vulnerability was fixed by using `String` which won't include any HTML function.
