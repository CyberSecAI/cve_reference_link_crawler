- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the "format" parameter of the login page for sites using Atmail hosting version 6.5.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding of the "format" parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the web page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the victim's browser, which could allow an attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform actions on the user's behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code injected into the "format" parameter, which when visited by a user, executes the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to visit it, typically by social engineering techniques like sending a phishing email with a crafted URL. The vulnerable version is Atmail 6.5.0.
