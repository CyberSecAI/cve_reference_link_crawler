In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: fully validate NFT_DATA_VALUE on store to data registers

register store validation for NFT_DATA_VALUE is conditional, however,
the datatype is always either NFT_DATA_VALUE or NFT_DATA_VERDICT. This
only requires a new helper function to infer the register type from the
set datatype so this conditional check can be removed. Otherwise,
pointer to chain object can be leaked through the registers.
