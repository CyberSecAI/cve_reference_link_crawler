Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`id` parameter from the GET request) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application does not sanitize or validate the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code uses direct string concatenation instead of prepared statements or parameterized queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially manipulate the SQL query to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the server or operating system (depending on database server configuration).
    *   Bypass authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted GET request to the `/manage_receiving.php` endpoint, where the `id` parameter is manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need authentication since this vulnerability is in the `/manage_receiving.php` file which handles a GET request with `id` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
    ```php
    if(isset($_GET['id'])){
    	$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM receiving_list where id=".$_GET['id'])->fetch_array();
    	foreach($qry as $k => $val){
    		$$k = $val;
    	}
    	$inv = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM inventory where type=1 and form_id=".$_GET['id']);

    }
    ```
*   **Example Attack:** An attacker could modify the `id` parameter like this: `/manage_receiving.php?id=1 UNION SELECT * FROM users;` to potentially retrieve data from the users table.
*   **Software:** Campcodes Online Laundry Management System v1.0
*   **Affected Component:** `manage_receiving.php`
*   **Database:** MySQL
