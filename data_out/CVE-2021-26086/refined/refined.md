**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `/WEB-INF/web.xml` endpoint of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing attackers to navigate the file system beyond the intended web root and access arbitrary files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Specific Endpoint:** The vulnerability is located within the `/WEB-INF/web.xml` endpoint.
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers use path traversal techniques (e.g., using `../` sequences) to navigate to files outside of the web application's directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the Jira server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited pre-authentication.
