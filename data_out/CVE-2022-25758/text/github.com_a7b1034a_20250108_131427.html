### **[prb112](/prb112)** commented [Jan 12, 2022](#issue-1100793167)

| Dear SCSS-Tokenizer Team,  In scanning my node\_modules for [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) Affecting org.webjars.npm:postcss](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1255641) and [CVE-2021-23382](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23382)  I encountered scss-tokenizer with [previous-map.js](https://github.com/sasstools/scss-tokenizer/blob/master/src/previous-map.js#L34) with the same style regular expression that is cited in the CVE [commit](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/commit/2b1d04c867995e55124e0a165b7c6622c1735956).  *postcss*  ```     return sourceMapString.match(/\/\*\s*# sourceMappingURL=(.*)\*\//)[1].trim()  ```  *scss-tokenizer*  ``` let match = css.match(/\/\*\s*# sourceMappingURL=(.*)\s*\*\//)  ```  It's slightly different, and maybe worth your time to double check.  I hope this helps. |
