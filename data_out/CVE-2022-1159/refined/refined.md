- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper control of generation of code (code injection). An attacker with administrator access on a workstation running Studio 5000 Logix Designer can inject malicious code into the controller.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code Injection (CWE-94)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to download a modified program to the controller, which could have severe consequences in the industrial control environment.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to a workstation running Studio 5000 Logix Designer with administrator privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrator access on a workstation that has Studio 5000 Logix Designer installed.
