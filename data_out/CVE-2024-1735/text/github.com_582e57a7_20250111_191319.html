# SAML authentication bypass due to missing validation on unsigned SAML messages

Critical

[jrhee17](/jrhee17)
published
GHSA-4m6j-23p2-8c54
Feb 26, 2024

## Package

maven

com.linecorp.armeria:armeria-saml
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 1.27.1

## Patched versions

1.27.2

## Description

### Impact

The SAML implementation provided by `armeria-saml` currently accepts unsigned SAML messages (assertions, logout requests, etc.) as they are, rather than rejecting them by default. As a result, an attacker can forge a SAML message to authenticate themselves, despite the fact that such an unsigned SAML message should be rejected.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in Armeria version 1.27.2. All users who rely on `armeria-saml` older than version 1.27.2 must upgrade to 1.27.2 or later.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround for this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
