- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `armeria-saml` library accepts unsigned SAML messages, which should be rejected by default. This missing validation of the SAML message signature allows attackers to forge messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of SAML message signatures. Specifically, the `SamlMessageUtil.validateSignature()` method does not enforce signature validation, allowing unsigned messages to be processed. This is categorized under CWE-304, Missing Critical Step in an Authentication Process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can forge a SAML message to authenticate themselves, gaining unauthorized access to resources protected by SAML authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, where an attacker can send a crafted, unsigned SAML message to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server, and be able to construct a SAML message. No privileges or user interaction are required to exploit this vulnerability.
