- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a flaw where specific files or directories being removed from the filesystem can lead to a user being unable to update the device firmware and prevent proper behavior of the webserver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties. The vulnerability lies in the fact that access to specific files or directories is not properly controlled, leading to the potential for their removal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability can prevent the user from updating the device firmware and also prevent the proper functioning of the webserver. It does *not* impact the BMXNOE and Modicon M340 operations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the manipulation of the filesystem by removing specific files or directories. The method to achieve this removal is not explicitly specified but is likely related to an exposed interface that can perform file system operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to access the device's filesystem to delete specific files or directories. The access method (e.g. via FTP or some other service) and authentication needed (if any) are not specified, but the advisory recommends blocking unauthorized access to FTP port 21/TCP.
