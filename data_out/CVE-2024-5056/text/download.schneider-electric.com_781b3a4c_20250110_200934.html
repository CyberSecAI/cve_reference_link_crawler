Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-5056

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.5 | Medium | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties vulnerability exists which may
prevent user to update the device firmware and prevent proper behavior of the webserver when
specific files or directories are removed from the filesystem.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

All versions

Schneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan for all
future versions of Modicon M340, BMXNOE0100,
BMXNOE0110 that will include a fix for this vulnerability. We
will update this document when the remediation is available.

Until then, customers should immediately apply the following
mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall

to block all unauthorized access to FTP port 21/TCP on
the devices.

•  FTP service is disabled by default. Deactivate the FTP

service after use when not needed.

•  Configure the Access Control List following the

recommendations of the user manuals:

“Modicon M340 for Ethernet Communications
Modules and Processors User Manual” in
chapter “Messaging Configuration Parameters”:

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
