Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL Injection vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `projectID` parameter within the `EditProject.php` script before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization/parameterization. The vulnerability is present in the `projectID` parameter of the `EditProject.php` script.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can compromise the application, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, and potentially exploit underlying database vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation allows full database control, including reading, writing, and deleting data.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `/TaskManager/EditProject.php` with a malicious `projectID` parameter. The request can be crafted manually or using tools like Burp Suite and SQLMap.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques, and use tools like Burp Suite and sqlmap to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker does not need prior access to the application or authentication to trigger the vulnerability on this specific endpoint.
