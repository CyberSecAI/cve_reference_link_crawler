Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the Linux kernel's 9p filesystem driver handles permissions for plain 9P2000 protocol. It allows "garbage" bits in the permission data to be passed through without proper sanitization. Specifically, the code uses `mode & S_IALLUGO` which doesn't mask out the SUID, SGID, and sticky bits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of permission bits received via the 9P2000 protocol.
- **Incorrect Permission Mapping:** The code responsible for converting 9P mode to Unix permissions incorrectly allows arbitrary bits to be set, including the SUID bit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially set the SUID bit on files within the mounted 9p filesystem. This could lead to privilege escalation, where a user can execute files with the permissions of the file owner (usually root), potentially gaining elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **9P Filesystem Mount:** The attack vector involves mounting a malicious 9p filesystem on a vulnerable Linux system.
- **Crafted Permissions:** The attacker needs to control the permission bits sent through the 9P2000 protocol during file creation or modification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over a 9P server:** The attacker must control the 9P server to send crafted permission data.
- **Ability to mount a 9P share:** The attacker must be able to mount the malicious 9p share on the target system.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is located in the `fs/9p/vfs_inode.c` file, within the function `p9mode2perm`. The fix changes this line:
```c
res = mode & S_IALLUGO;
```
to:
```c
res = mode & 0777; /* S_IRWXUGO */
```
This change ensures that only the read, write, and execute bits are considered, effectively preventing the unintended setting of SUID, SGID, and sticky bits through the plain 9P2000 protocol.

The provided content includes multiple git commits that all address this vulnerability in various kernel branches. The commits all contain the same fix, with variations in the surrounding code structure between kernel versions.

The Debian LTS advisory lists this CVE and shows it as part of a larger set of fixes in a Linux kernel security update.
