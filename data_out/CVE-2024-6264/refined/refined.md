Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `$meta_key` parameter within the Post Meta Data Manager plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input when displaying metadata, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or other client-side scripts into the metadata.
*   **Account Compromise:** When a user views a page containing the injected script, the script will execute within their browser session. This could lead to actions being performed on behalf of the victim.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could steal session cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the page or redirect the user to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Metadata Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the `$meta_key` parameter. The plugin then stores this malicious payload into the database.
*   **Page Load Trigger:** When a user accesses the page displaying the metadata, the malicious script is executed, resulting in compromise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor level access.
*   **Plugin Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the Post Meta Data Manager plugin's functionalities.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in how the plugin displays post, term, and user metadata. Specifically, the `pmdm_wp_display_post_metadata_html.php`, `pmdm_wp_display_term_metadata_html.php`, and `pmdm_wp_display_user_metadata_html.php` files are affected.
*   The vulnerable code is where the `$meta_key` is output on the page within the edit/delete links and headers, specifically within these files:
    *   `pmdm_wp_display_post_metadata_html.php` at lines 42, 47, 85
    *    `pmdm_wp_display_term_metadata_html.php` at lines 51, 56, 94
    *    `pmdm_wp_display_user_metadata_html.php` at lines 50, 52, 55, 94
*   The fix involves proper escaping using `esc_html()` on the output of `$meta_key`, which prevents the execution of injected scripts.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Post Meta Data Manager plugin versions up to and including 1.2.3.

**Patched Version:**

*   Post Meta Data Manager plugin version 1.3.0 and above.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 1, 2024.
*   The provided information includes code snippets demonstrating the vulnerable areas, and the changes in version 1.3.0 to remediate the vulnerability by adding `esc_html()` to the vulnerable code locations.
*   The vulnerability is considered a medium severity issue (CVSS 6.4).
