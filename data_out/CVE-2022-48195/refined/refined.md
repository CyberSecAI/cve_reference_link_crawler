- Root cause of vulnerability: When a remote server advertises support for channel binding during a SCRAM-based SASL authentication, an empty nonce is used by the client.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The use of an empty nonce during SCRAM authentication can lead to insufficient randomness.
- Impact of exploitation: When paired with a server that does not properly verify the nonce length, it could result in insufficient randomness being used during authentication. This could weaken the authentication process, though no known exploits or exploit chains currently exist. Authentication will fail when paired with a server that does verify the nonce length.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability occurs during the SCRAM-based SASL authentication process when the client interacts with a server that supports channel binding.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need to be able to trigger a SASL authentication handshake with the vulnerable client using a server that either does not check the nonce or accepts a zero-length nonce.
