{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plv8 cursor implementation is missing rollbacks, allowing a malicious user to catch errors during cursor operations and commit the transaction instead of rolling back.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing rollbacks in plv8 cursor implementation",
    "Improper error handling allows commit instead of rollback"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user who can create objects in a database with plv8 installed can cause deferred triggers to execute as the Superuser during autovacuum, leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious user with the ability to create objects within a database where plv8 is installed can exploit this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a user capable of creating database objects in a PostgreSQL instance with the plv8 extension installed."
