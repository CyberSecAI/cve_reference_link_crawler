The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in the TOTOLINK N350RT router firmware (V9.3.5u.6139_B20201216).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the "FileName" parameter in the `UploadFirmwareFile` function. The value of this parameter is directly passed to the `dosystem` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `dosystem` function executes the provided string using the `system` function, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to sanitize the "FileName" parameter before passing it to the `dosystem` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router's operating system.
- **Root Shell Access:** By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can gain a stable root shell on the device, allowing them to fully compromise it.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.
- **"FileName" Parameter:** The malicious commands are injected into the "FileName" parameter within the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have access to the router's management interface.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to send POST requests to the target router with the exploit.
