{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the core HTML parsing module of CKEditor 4. It stems from incorrect detection of CDATA content, which allows attackers to inject malicious HTML code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper CDATA handling",
      "Bypassing Advanced Content Filtering (ACF)"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. By injecting malformed HTML that bypasses ACF, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the CKEditor 4 instance, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious HTML injected through full-page editing",
      "Malicious HTML injected through CDATA elements with ACF enabled"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to input or manipulate HTML content that is processed by a vulnerable CKEditor 4 instance. This could occur through direct input in source mode, or by manipulating data loaded into the editor."
