    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-2356",
    "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "affected_products": [
      "Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows",
      "Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere",
      "OnCommand Insight",
      "OnCommand Workflow Automation",

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the MySQL server's replication component.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of replication data",
        "Potential for a denial of service"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS). The vulnerability could result in a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.",
       "attack_vector": "Network. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely, likely using a crafted MySQL protocol request that interacts with the replication mechanism.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have network access to the MySQL server. The attacker would need to have at least low privileges to interact with the replication functionality. The CVSS vector indicates the need for a low privileged user on a network, but with a high attack complexity.",
	 "additional_notes": "The provided information does not specify the exact method of exploitation. However, it is likely related to the processing or handling of replication data within the MySQL server."
