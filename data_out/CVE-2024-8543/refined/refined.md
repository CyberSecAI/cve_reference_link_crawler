Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `[sciba]` shortcode of the Slider comparison image before and after WordPress plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** By using the `[sciba]` shortcode and injecting malicious JavaScript code in the attributes, an authenticated user with Contributor level access or higher can store the malicious code in the database.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Contributor" level access to be able to use the shortcode on a page.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious javascript via the shortcode.
