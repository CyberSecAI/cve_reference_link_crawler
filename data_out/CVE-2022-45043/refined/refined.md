Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2022-45043.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `fast_setting_internet_set` interface, where the function `sub_42581C` fails to sanitize the `staticIp` parameter passed by the user. This lack of input validation allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands via the `staticIp` parameter.
- Lack of Input Validation: The function `sub_42581C` does not filter or sanitize the input it receives through the `staticIp` parameter.
- Use of `sprintf` and `doSystemCmd_route`: The combination of `sprintf` to format a command string with unsanitized user input and then executing it with `doSystemCmd_route` is the root cause of the command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: An attacker can execute any system command on the router.
- Data exfiltration: As shown in the example, an attacker can copy sensitive files, such as the admin configuration file.
- Complete control: Through further exploitation, an attacker may achieve complete control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/fast_setting_internet_set` endpoint.
- `staticIp` parameter: The malicious command is injected through the `staticIp` parameter in the POST request data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface (e.g., on the same network or through port forwarding).
- Authentication (as noted in the content): Although not directly mentioned in the exploit details, the attacker must first authenticate to the web interface to trigger the vulnerability.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.
