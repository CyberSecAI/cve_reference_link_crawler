Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-45019**

*   **Root Cause:** The `category` parameter in the `category.php` resource of the Online Bus Booking System v1.0 does not validate user-supplied input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization or validation. The code directly incorporates the unsanitized GET parameter `$cat_type` into an SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can perform various malicious actions, including, but not limited to:
    *   Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
    *   Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   Potentially gaining control of the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessible through the `category` GET parameter in the `category.php` file.
    *   Attackers can craft malicious URLs with SQL injection payloads in the `category` parameter to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
if (isset($_GET['category'])) {
    $cat_type = $_GET['category'];
}

$query = "SELECT *  FROM  posts WHERE post_category_id=$cat_type";
$select_all_bus = mysqli_query($connection,$query);
```
This code retrieves the value of the `category` parameter from the URL's GET request and directly uses it in an SQL query without any sanitization or validation. This lack of input validation leads to the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a group of related SQL Injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-45012, CVE-2023-45015, CVE-2023-45018, and CVE-2023-45019) affecting the same application, "Online Bus Booking System v1.0."
*   There is no patch available currently to remediate this vulnerability.
*   The CVSSv3 base score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
