- **Root cause of vulnerability:** One-level read path traversal in the `/custom_component` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability, limited to one directory level.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can access and leak source code from custom Gradio components by manipulating the file path in the request, potentially exposing proprietary or sensitive code.
- **Attack vectors:** Manipulating the file path in requests to the `/custom_component` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server hosting a vulnerable Gradio application with custom components. The custom components need to reside in a path accessible through the path traversal.
