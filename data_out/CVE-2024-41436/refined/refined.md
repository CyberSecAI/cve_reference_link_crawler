Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an issue in how ClickHouse handles constant expressions during insertion into distributed tables, specifically when using the MySQL interface. The `DB::evaluateConstantExpressionImpl` function was using the old analyzer unconditionally, which led to a segmentation fault when processing certain complex queries involving subqueries and function calls. This occurs because the old analyzer does not properly handle the query, while the new experimental analyzer has the proper logic to handle the query without crashing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Segmentation Fault/Crash:** The primary vulnerability is a segmentation fault caused by a null pointer dereference, leading to a server crash when processing a specific SQL query involving subqueries with `coalesce` and `MACNumToString`, `lcm` functions during insertion into a distributed table.
-   **Old Analyzer Usage:** The usage of the old analyzer in the `DB::evaluateConstantExpressionImpl` function, even when the `allow_experimental_analyzer` setting is enabled, is the fundamental weakness that triggers the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a server crash, effectively causing a denial of service. This can disrupt database availability and impact any applications relying on the ClickHouse server.
-   **Data integrity issues**: Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, a crash during an insert operation can potentially lead to data integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specifically crafted `INSERT` SQL query. While not a typical SQL injection, an attacker can use the malicious SQL to trigger the vulnerability.
-   **MySQL Interface:** The vulnerability was initially discovered and reproduced using the MySQL interface of ClickHouse, but also reproducible via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Database Access:** The attacker needs the ability to execute SQL queries against the ClickHouse database, specifically the ability to insert into distributed tables.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Query:** The attacker needs to craft an SQL query that includes the vulnerable constructs, such as subqueries with `coalesce`, `MACNumToString`, and `lcm` in the `INSERT` statement.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the ClickHouse server through the MySQL interface or HTTP.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found by a fuzzing tool and was reproducible in ClickHouse versions 24.3.3.102 and 24.5.3.5, and even on the latest master at the time of reporting.
- The issue is not reproducible through the native ClickHouse client due to another bug, highlighting the importance of diverse testing methods.
- The vulnerability was resolved by modifying `DB::evaluateConstantExpressionImpl` to correctly use the new analyzer when the `allow_experimental_analyzer` setting is enabled.
- A test case was added in the fix to prevent regression of the vulnerability.
- The issue was resolved in version 24.9.1.1 and later, where it now throws a SYNTAX_ERROR instead of crashing the server.
