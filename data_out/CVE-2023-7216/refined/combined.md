| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2249901#c0)  Nick Tait    2023-11-15 20:50:58 UTC  ``` Summary:  CPIO  found to be vulnerable to Path Traversal vulnerability that can be leveraged to achieve full Remote Command Execution on the target.  Details:  While handling CPIO archives, the CPIO follows symlink, cpio by default will follow stored symlinks while extracting and the Archiver will not check the symlink location, which leads to arbitrary file writes to unintended locations. When the victim extracts the archive, the attacker can craft a malicious cpio archive to achieve RCE on the target system.  PoC ( Steps to reproduce ) : Complete instructions to craft a cpio archive to demonstrate the vulnerability.  ``` mkdir testcpio  ln -sf /tmp/ testcpio/tmp  echo "TEST Traversal" > testcpio/tmpYtrav.txt  cd testcpio/  ls | cpio -ov > ../trav.cpio  cd ../  sed -i s/"tmpY"/"tmp\/"/g trav.cpio  ```  Extract the malicious archive: cpio -i < trav.cpio   Impact: An attacker can craft malicious cpio archives that exploit the vulnerability to write files on locations such as ~/.ssh, ~/.bashrc, ~/.config/autostart/ etc., to achieve full remote command execution on the target/victim system. Software that uses CPIO as a component might be vulnerable.

Corrected link is <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-cpio/2024-02/msg00000.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2249901#c8)  peng    2024-03-04 09:10:12 UTC  ``` <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-cpio/2024-03/msg00000.html> [CVE-2023-7216](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-7216)  has been rejected by the upstream community , cpio maintainer don't think it's a bug. Is the Red Hat community considering marking [CVE-2023-7216](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-7216) as rejected on NVD?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2249901#c10)  Michal Schorm    2024-05-13 16:24:57 UTC  ``` I see no difference between this [CVE-2023-7216](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-7216) and the [CVE-2015-1197](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1197). Both CVEs are about the same thing: escaping the directory tree the archive is extracted in. The way the reproducer is constructed is a bit different but from what I can tell it results in the same principle.  I've made an extensive summary of the [CVE-2015-1197](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1197) here: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179773#c8](show_bug.cgi?id=1179773#c8 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2015-1197 cpio: directory traversal through symlinks")  I don't understand why this CVE is rated 'moderate' (was even 'high' for a while), while the [CVE-2015-1197](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1197) is rated 'low'.  After 8 years, the upstream created a fix for the cpio '--no-absolute-filenames' option, so it now prevents the attack. Other than that the upstream rejected this CVE, stating to use the fixed '--no-absolute-filenames' option, which entirely prevents it.  As I've pointed out in the [CVE-2015-1197](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1197), we haven't fixed even that in RHEL 7, 8, 9. And it doesn't seem to be a problem, at least as far as I can tell.  I believe these two CVEs are the exact same, only revived few years later. As it wasn't a problem with the [CVE-2015-1197](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1197), I strongly suggest to use the same resolution. Which is: - lower the CVE severity to 'low' - close as 'WON'T FIX'  The RHEL 10 will likely be the first RHEL distribution containing the fix.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2249901#c13)  Nick Tait    2024-05-15 19:31:18 UTC  ``` Created cpio tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2280700](show_bug.cgi?id=2280700 "NEW - CVE-2023-7216 cpio: extraction allows symlinks which enables Remote Command Execution [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
