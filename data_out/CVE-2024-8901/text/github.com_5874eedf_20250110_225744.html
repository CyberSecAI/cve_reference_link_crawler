# [awslabs/aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio] Lack of JWT issuer and signer validation

## Package

aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio

## Affected versions

1.0, 1.1

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

The [AWS ALB Route Directive Adapter For Istio repo](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio/tree/master) provides an OIDC authentication mechanism that was integrated into the open source Kubeflow project. The adapter uses JWT for authentication, but lacks proper signer and issuer validation. In deployments of ALB that ignore security best practices, where ALB targets are directly exposed to internet traffic, an actor can provide a JWT signed by an untrusted entity in order to spoof OIDC-federated sessions and successfully bypass authentication.

### Impact

Impacted versions: v1.0, v1.1

### Patches

The repository/package has been deprecated, is End of Life, and is no longer actively supported.

### Workarounds

As a security best practice, ensure that your ELB targets (e.g. EC2 Instances, Fargate Tasks etc.) do not have public IP addresses.

Ensure any forked or derivative code validate that the signer attribute in the JWT match the ARN of the Application Load Balancer that the service is configured to use.

### References

* [ALB Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html) specifically "To ensure security, you must verify the signature before doing any authorization based on the claims and validate that the signer field in the JWT header contains the expected Application Load Balancer ARN."
* [Python example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html#user-claims-encoding)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
