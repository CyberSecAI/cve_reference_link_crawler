# CVE-2024-8901 - missing JWT issuer and signer validation in aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio

**Publication Date: 2024/10/21 4:00 PM PDT**

The [AWS ALB Route Directive Adapter For Istio repo](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio/tree/master) provides an OIDC authentication mechanism that was integrated into the open source Kubeflow project. The adapter uses JWT for authentication, but lacks proper signer and issuer validation. In deployments of ALB that ignore security best practices, where ALB targets are directly exposed to internet traffic, an actor can provide a JWT signed by an untrusted entity in order to spoof OIDC-federated sessions and successfully bypass authentication.

**Affected versions:** v1.0, v1.1

**Resolution**

The repository/package has been deprecated, is End of Life, and is no longer actively supported.

**Workarounds**

As a security best practice, ensure that your ELB targets (e.g. EC2 Instances, Fargate Tasks etc.) do not have public IP addresses.

Ensure any forked or derivative code validate that the signer attribute in the JWT match the ARN of the Application Load Balancer that the service is configured to use.

**References**

* [ALB Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html) specifically "To ensure security, you must verify the signature before doing any authorization based on the claims and validate that the signer field in the JWT header contains the expected Application Load Balancer ARN."
* [Python example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html#user-claims-encoding)
* [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio/security/advisories/GHSA-789x-wph8-m68r)
* [CVE-2024-8901](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8901)

We would like to thank Miggo Security for collaborating on this issue through the coordinated disclosure process.

Please email aws-security@amazon.com with any security questions or concerns.
