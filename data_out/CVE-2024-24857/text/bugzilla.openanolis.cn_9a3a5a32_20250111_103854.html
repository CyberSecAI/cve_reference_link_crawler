| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8155#c0)  Shiloong   admin  2024-02-01 17:30:40 UTC  ``` 上报人信息：   - 白家驹 <baijiaju@buaa.edu.cn>   - 北京航空航天大学网络空间安全学院  成因： conn_info_{min,max}_age_set函数用于更新hdev->conn_info_{min,max}_age，不允许使conn_info_max_age小于conn_info_min_age，但在判断更新参数合法性时没有持有锁，conn_info_{min,max}_age可能在判断更新参数合法性后被改写，使判断更新参数合法性的比较无效化，从而写入非法的conn_info_{min,max}_age，使conn_info_max_age小于conn_info_min_age。 	 危害分析： hdev->conn_info_{min,max}_age是蓝牙组件的重要参数。hdev->conn_info_{min,max}_age在get_conn_info函数中被用于计算conn_info_age，采用了直接相减的形式，如果conn_info_max_age小于conn_info_min_age，会发生整数溢出，造成conn_info_age过大，get_conn_info返回非法缓冲值，造成蓝牙连接异常。  bug触发后，hdev->conn_info_{min,max}_age非法，会发生整数溢出，造成蓝牙连接异常，可以用于拒绝服务攻击。  修复缓解：    - 在conn_info_{min,max}_age_set函数中，扩大缓冲区，将判断更新参数合法性代码纳入hci_dev_lock的临界区。  补丁已提交给Linux Kernel Bluetooth子系统维护者，补丁链接：[https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20231222162310.6461-1-2045gemini@gmail.com/T/](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20231222162310.6461-1-2045gemini%40gmail.com/T/) ``` |  |
