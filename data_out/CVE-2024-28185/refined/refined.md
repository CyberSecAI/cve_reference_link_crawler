Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to sanitize or validate the sandbox directory before writing a `run_script`. Specifically, the application does not check for or prevent symbolic links (symlinks) within the sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unvalidated File Paths:** The application directly writes to a file path (`run_script`) within the sandbox without verifying that it's not a symlink.
- **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a classic symbolic link issue, where a controlled symlink can cause file operations to occur in unintended locations.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the contents of the sandbox environment, allowing attackers to place malicious symlinks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can create a symlink named `run_script` pointing to an arbitrary file outside the sandbox. This allows the attacker to write to files on the host system.
- **Code Execution:** By overwriting system scripts or configuration files, the attacker can gain code execution outside the sandbox.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The Judge0 docker container runs with the `privileged` flag. This can allow an attacker to mount the host filesystem, write to arbitrary locations, and potentially escalate their privileges on the host system.
- **System Compromise:** Full access to the Judge0 system, including the database, internal networks, web server and any other applications on the host is a possible outcome.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning the attacker doesn't need direct access to the server's file system.
- **Malicious Submission:** The attacker crafts a malicious submission that includes a zip file containing a symbolic link named `run` (which becomes `run_script` after extraction) which points to an arbitrary location.
- **Command Line Arguments Manipulation:** The attacker further modifies the `command_line_arguments` to include commands which will execute on the location targeted by the symlink.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Judge0 server's API.
- **Ability to Create Submissions:** The attacker needs to be able to submit code to the Judge0 system.
- **Understanding of Zip Files and Symlinks:** The attacker needs to be able to create a zip file containing a malicious symlink to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** Some knowledge of the target system is helpful to identify useful targets for symlink creation, such as scripts or configuration files which can be used for code execution.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) python script, which demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was rated as critical with a CVSS score of 10.0.
- The vulnerability affects Judge0 versions <= 1.13.0 and is fixed in versions >= 1.13.1.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-h9g2-45c8-89cf.
- The CWE associated with the vulnerability is CWE-61, which refers to Improper Link Resolution Before File Access.
