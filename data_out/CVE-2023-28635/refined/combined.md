# Defining resource name as integer may give unintended access

Low

[frankcorneliusmartin](/frankcorneliusmartin)
published
GHSA-7x94-6g2m-3hp2
Oct 11, 2023

## Package

pip

vantage6
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.9

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Malicious users may try to get access to resources they are not allowed to see, by creating resources with integers as names.

One example where this is a risk, is when users define which users are allowed to run algorithms on their node. This may be defined by username or user id. Now, for example, if user id 13 is allowed to run tasks, and an attacker creates a username with username '13', they would be wrongly allowed to run an algorithm.

There may also be other places in the code where such a mixup of resource ID or name leads to issues. The best solution we see is therefore to check when resources are created or modified, that the resource name always starts with a character.

### Patches

To be done, probably in v3.9

### Workarounds

None

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-28635

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

>   [PR#748](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/748)).

* **Feature**

> * A complete permission scope has been added at the collaboration level,
>   allowing projects to assign one user to manage everything within that
>   collaboration level without requiring global access
>   ([Issue#245](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/245),
>   [PR#711](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/711)).
> * Added decorators `@algorithm_client` and `@data()` to make the signatures
>   and names of algorithm functions more flexible and also to allow for multiple
>   databases ([Issue#440](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/440),
>   [PR#652](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/652)).
> * Allow a single algorithm function to make use of multiple databases
>   ([Issue#804](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/804),
>   [PR#652](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/652),
>   [PR#807](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/807)).
> * Enforce pagination in the API to improve performance, and add a sort
>   parameter for GET requests which yield multiple resources
>   ([Issue#392](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/392),
>   [PR#611](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/611)).
> * Share a node's database labels and types with the central server, so that the
>   server can validate that these match between nodes and offer them as
>   suggestions to the user when creating tasks
>   ([Issue#750](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/750),
>   [PR#751](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/751)).
> * `vnode new` now automatically retrieves information on e.g. whether the
>   collaboration is encrypted, so that the user doesn't have to specify this
>   information themselves
>   ([Issue#434](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/434),
>   [PR#739](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/739)).
> * Allow only unique names for organizations, collaborations, and nodes
>   ([Issue#242](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/242),
>   [PR#515](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/515)).
> * New function `client.task.wait_for_completion()` for the AlgorithmClient
>   to allow waiting for subtasks to complete
>   ([Issue#651](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/651),
>   [PR#727](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/727)).
> * Improved validation of the input for all POST and PATCH requests using
>   marshmallow schemas ([Issue#76](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/76),
>   [PR#744](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/744)).
> * Added option `user_created` to filter tasks that have been directly
>   created by a user and are thus not subtasks
>   ([Issue#583](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/583),
>   [PR#599](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/599)).
> * Users can now assign rules to other users that they don't have themselves
>   if they do have higher permisions on the same resource
>   ([Issue#443](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/443),
>   [PR#781](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/781)).

* **Change**

> * Changed the API response structure: no longer returning as many linked
>   resources for performance reasons
>   ([Issue#49](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/49),
>   [PR#709](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/709))
> * The `result` endpoint has been renamed to `run` as this was a misnomer
>   that concerns algorithm runs
>   ([Issue#436](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/436),
>   [PR#527](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/527)),
>   [PR#620](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/620)).
> * Split the vantage6-client package: the Python user client is kept in this
>   package, and a new vantage6-algorithm-tools PyPI package is created for the
>   tools that help algorithm developers. These tools were part of the client
>   package, but moving them reduces the sizes of both packages
>   ([Issue#662](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/662),
>   [PR#763](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/763))
> * Removed environments test, dev, prod, acc and application from
>   vantage6 servers and nodes as these were used little
>   ([Issue#260](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/260),
>   [PR#643](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/643))
> * Harmonized the interfaces between the AlgorithmClient and the MockClient
>   ([Issue#669](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/669),
>   [PR#722](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/722))
> * When users request resources where they are not allowed to see everything,
>   they now get an unauthorized error instead of an incomplete or empty response
>   ([Issue#635](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/635),
>   [PR#711](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/711)).
> * Node checks the server's version and by default, it pulls a matching image
>   instead of the latest image of it's major version
>   ([Issue#700](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/700),
>   [PR#706](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/706)).
> * `vserver-local` commands have been removed if they were not used within the
>   docker images or the CLI ([Issue#663](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/663),
>   [PR#728](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/728)).
> * The way in which RabbitMQ is started locally has been changed to make it
>   easier to run RabbitMQ locally. Now, a user indicates with a configuration
>   flag whether they expect RabbitMQ to be started locally
>   ([Issue#282](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/282),
>   [PR#795](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/795)).
> * The place in which server configuration files were stored on Linux has been
>   changed fro `/etc/xdg` to `/etc/vantage6/`
>   ([Issue#269](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/269),
>   [PR#789](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/789)).
> * Backwards compatibility code that was present to make different v3.x versions
>   compatible has been removed. Additionally, small improvements have been made
>   that were not possible to do without breaking compatibility
>   ([Issue#454](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/454),
>   [PR#740](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/740),
>   [PR#758](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/758)).

* **Bugfix**

> * Remove wrong dot in the version for prereleases (
>   [PR#764](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/764)).
> * Users were not assigned any permissions if vserver import was run before
>   the server had ever been started
>   ([Issue#634](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/634),
>   [PR#806](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/806)).

> * Setting up the host network for VPN did not work properly if the host had
>   `iptables-legacy` installed rather than `iptables`. Now, the code has
>   been made compatible with both
>   ([Issue#725](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/725),
>   [PR#802](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/802)).

## 3.11.0

*21 August 2023*

* **Feature**

> * A suite of vdev commands has been added to the CLI. These commands
>   allow you to easily create a development environment for vantage6. The
>   commands allow you to easily create a server configuration, add organizations
>   and collaborations to it, and create the appropriate node configurations.
>   Also, you can easily start, stop, and remove the network.
>   ([Issue#625](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/625),
>   [PR#624](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/624)).
> * User Interface can now be started from the CLI with vserver start --with-ui
>   ([Issue#730](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/730),
>   [PR#735](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/735)).
> * Added created\_at and finished\_at timestamps to tasks
>   ([Issue#621](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/621),
>   [PR#715](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/715)).

* **Change**

> * Help text for the CLI has been updated and the formatting has been improved
>   ([Issue#745](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/745),
>   [PR#791](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/791)).
> * With vnode list, the terms online and offline have been replaced by
>   running and not running. This is more accurate, since a node may be
>   unable to authenticate and thus be offline, but still be running.
>   ([Issue#733](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/733),
>   [PR#734](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/734)).
> * Some legacy code that no longer fulfilled a function has been removed from
>   the endpoint to create tasks
>   ([Issue#742](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/742),
>   [PR#747](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/747)).

* **Bugfix**

> * In the docs, the example file to import server resources with
>   vserver import was accidentally empty; now it contains example data.
>   ([PR#792](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/792)).

## 3.10.4

*27 June 2023*

* **Change**

> * Extended the AlgorithmMockClient so that algorithm developers may pass it
>   organization id's and node id's
>   ([PR#737](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/737)).

* **Bugfix**

> * Speed up starting algorithm using VPN (
>   [Issue#681](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/681),
>   [PR#732](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/732)).
> * Updated VPN configurator Dockerfile so that VPN configuration works on
>   Ubuntu 22 ([Issue#724](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/724),
>   [PR#725](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/725)).

## 3.10.3

*20 June 2023*

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed bug in copying the MockClient itself to pass it on to a child task (
>   [PR#723](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/723)).

Note

Release 3.10.2 failed to be published to PyPI due to a gateway error,
so that version was skipped.

## 3.10.1

*19 June 2023*

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed bug in setting organization\_id for the AlgorithmClient (
>   [Issue#719](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/719),
>   [PR#720](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/720)).

## 3.10.0

*19 June 2023*

* **Feature**

> * There is a new implementation of a mock client, the `MockAlgorithmClient`.
>   This client is an improved version of the old `ClientMockProtocol`. The
>   new mock client now contains all the same functions as the regular client
>   with the same signatures, and it returns the same data fields as those
>   functions. Also, you may submit all supported data formats instead of just
>   CSV files, and you may also submit pandas Dataframes directly
>   ([Issue#683](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/683),
>   [PR#702](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/702)).

* **Change**

> * Updated cryptography dependency from 39.0.1 to 41.0.0
>   ([PR#707](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/707),
>   [PR#708](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/708)).

* **Bugfix**

> * A node's VPN IP address was previously only updated when a new task was
>   started on that node. Instead, it is now updated properly on VPN connect/
>   disconnect ([Issue#520](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/520),
>   [PR#704](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/704)).

## 3.9.0

*25 May 2023*

* **Feature**

> * Data sources may now be whitelisted by IP address, so that an
>   algorithm may access those IP addresses to obtain data. This is achieved
>   via a Squid proxy server
>   ([Issue#162](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/162),
>   [PR#626](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/626)).
> * There is a new configuration option to let algorithms access gpu's
>   ([Issue#597](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/597),
>   [PR#623](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/623)).
> * Added option to get VPN IP addresses and ports of just the children or
>   just the parent of an algorithm that is running. These options may be used
>   to simplify VPN communication between algorithms running on different nodes.
>   In the AlgorithmClient, the functions `client.vpn.get_child_addresses()`
>   and `client.vpn.get_parent_address()` have been added
>   ([PR#610](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/610)).
> * New option to print the full stack trace of algorithm errors. Note that
>   this option may leak sensitive information if used carelessly. The option
>   may be activated by setting `log_traceback=True` in the algorithm wrapper
>   ([Issue#675](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/675),
>   [PR#680](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/680)).
> * Configuration options to control the log levels of individual dependencies.
>   This allows easier debugging when a certain dependency is causing issues
>   ([Issue#641](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/641),
>   [PR#642](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/642)).

* **Change**

> * Better error message for `vnode attach` when no nodes are running
>   ([Issue#606](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/606),
>   [PR#607](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/607)).
> * The number of characters of the task input printed to the logs is now limited
>   to prevent flooding the logs with very long input
>   ([Issue#549](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/549),
>   [PR#550](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/550)).
> * Node proxy logs are now written to a separate log file. This makes the
>   main node log more readable
>   ([Issue#546](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/546),
>   [PR#619](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/619)).
> * Update code in which the version is updated
>   ([PR#586](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/586)).
> * Finished standardizing docstrings - note that this was already partially
>   done in earlier releases
>   ([Issue#255](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/255)).
> * Cleanup and moving of unused code and duplicate code
>   ([PR#571](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/571)).
> * It is now supported to run the release pipeline from `release/v<x.y.z>`
>   branches ([Issue#467](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/467),
>   [PR#488](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/488)).
> * Replaced deprecated `set-output` method in Github actions release pipeline
>   ([Issue#474](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/474),
>   [PR#601](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/601)).

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed checking for newer images (node, server, and algorithms). Previously,
>   the dates used were not sufficient to check if an image was newer. Now,
>   we are also checking the image digest
>   ([Issue#507](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/507),
>   [PR#602](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/602)).
> * Users are prevented from posting socket events that are meant for nodes -
>   note that nothing harmful could be done but it should not be possible
>   nevertheless ([Issue#615](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/615),
>   [PR#616](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/616)).
> * Fixed bug with detecting if database was a file as '/mnt/' was not properly
>   prepended to the file path
>   ([PR#691](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/691)).

## 3.8.7

*10 May 2023*

* **Bugfix**

  > + Socket did connect before Docker was initialized, resulting in an exception
  >   at startup ([PR#644](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/644))

## 3.8.6

*9 May 2023*

  >   connection was lost ([PR#640](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/640),
  >   [Issue#637](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/637))

## 3.8.3 - 3.8.5

*25 April 2023 - 2 May 2023*

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed bug where a missing container lead to a complete node crash
>   ([PR#628](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/628),
>   [PR#629](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/629),
>   [PR#632](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/632)).
> * Restored algorithm wrapper namespace for backward compatibility (

> * Prevent error with first socket ping on node startup by waiting a few
>   seconds ([PR#609](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/609))

## 3.8.2

*22 march 2023*

* **Feature**

> * Location of the server configuration file in server shell script can now be
>   specified as an environment variable ([PR#604](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/604))

* **Change**

> * Changed ping/pong mechanism over socket connection between server and nodes,
>   as it did not function properly in combination with RabbitMQ. Now, the node
>   pushes a ping and the server periodically checks if the node is still alive
>   ([PR#593](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/593))

* **Bugfix**

> * For `vnode files`, take the new formatting of the databases in the node
>   configuration file into account ([PR#600](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/600))
> * Fix bugs in new algorithm client where class attributes were improperly

> * Fixed broken links in Discord notification
>   ([PR#591](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/591))

## 3.8.1

*8 march 2023*

* **Bugfix**

> * In 3.8.0, starting RabbitMQ for horizontal scaling caused a server crash
>   due to a missing `kombu` dependency. This dependency was wrongly removed
>   in updating all dependencies for python 3.10 (
>   [PR#585](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/585)).

## 3.8.0

*8 march 2023*

* **Security**

> * Refresh tokens are no longer indefinitely valid (
>   [CVE#CVE-2023-23929](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23929),
>   [commit](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/commit/48ebfca42359e9a6743e9598684585e2522cdce8)).
> * It was possible to obtain usernames by brute forcing the login since v3.3.0.
>   This was due to a change where users got to see a message their account was
>   blocked after N failed login attempts. Now, users get an email instead if
>   their account is blocked (
>   [CVE#CVE-2022-39228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-39228),
>   [commit](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/commit/ab4381c35d24add06f75d5a8a284321f7a340bd2)
>   ).
> * Assigning existing users to a different organizations was possible. This may
>   lead to unintended access: if a user from organization A is accidentally
>   assigned to organization B, they will retain their permissions and
>   therefore might be able to access resources they should not be allowed to
>   access ([CVE#CVE-2023-22738](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22738),
>   [commit](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/commit/798aca1de142a4eca175ef51112e2235642f4f24)).

* **Feature**

> * Python version upgrade to 3.10 and many dependencies are upgraded (
>   [PR#513](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/513),
>   [Issue#251](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/251)).
> * Added `AlgorithmClient` which will replace `ContainerClient` in v4.0.
>   For now, the new `AlgorithmClient` can be used by specifying
>   `use_new_client=True` in the algorithm wrapper (
>   [PR#510](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/510),
>   [Issue#493](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/493)).
> * It is now possible to request some of the node configuration settings, e.g.
>   which algorithms they allow to be run (
>   [PR#523](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/523),
>   [Issue#12](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/12)).
> * Added `auto_wrapper` which detects the data source types and reads the
>   data accordingly. This removes the need to rebuild every algorithm for
>   every data source type (
>   [PR#555](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/555),
>   [Issue#553](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/553)).
> * New endpoint added `/vpn/algorithm/addresses` for algorithms to obtain
>   addresses for containers that are part of the same computation task (
>   [PR#501](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/501),
>   [Issue#499](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/499)).
> * Added the option to allow only allow certain organization and/or users
>   to run tasks on your node. This can be done by using the `policies`
>   configuration option. Note that the `allowed_images` option is now
>   nested under the `policies` option (
>   [Issue#335](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/335),
>   [PR#556](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/556))

* **Change**

> * Some changes have been made to the release pipeline (
>   [PR#519](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/519),
>   [PR#488](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/488),
>   [PR#500](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/500),
>   [Issue#485](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/485)).
> * Removed unused script to start the shell (
>   [PR#494](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/494)).

* **Bugfix**

> * Algorithm containers running on the same node could not communicate with
>   each other through the VPN. This has been fixed (
>   [PR#532](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/532),
>   [Issue#336](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/336)).

## 3.7.3

*22 february 2023*

* **Bugfix**

> * A database commit in 3.7.2 was done on the wrong variable, this has been
>   corrected ([PR#547](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/547),
>   [Issue#534](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/534)).
> * Delete entries in the VPN port table after the algorithm has completed
>   ([PR#548](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/548)).
> * Limit number of characters of the task input printed to the logs
>   ([PR#550](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/550)).

## 3.7.2

*20 february 2023*

* **Bugfix**

> * In 3.7.1, some sessions were closed, but not all. Now, sessions are also
>   terminated in the socketIO events
>   ([PR#543](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/543),
>   [Issue#534](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/534)).
> * Latest versions of VPN images were not automatically downloaded by node
>   on VPN connection startup. This has been corrected (
>   [PR#542](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/542)).

## 3.7.1

*16 february 2023*

* **Change**

> * Some changes to the release pipeline.

* **Bugfix**

> * `iptables` dependency was missing in the VPN client container (
>   [PR#533](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/533)
>   [Issue#518](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/518)).
> * Fixed a bug that did not close Postgres DB sessions, resulting in a dead
>   server ([PR#540](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/540),
>   [Issue#534](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/534)).

## 3.7.0

*25 january 2023*

* **Feature**

> * SSH tunnels are available on the node. This allows nodes to connect to
>   other machines over SSH, thereby greatly expanding the options to connect
>   databases and other services to the node, which before could only be made
>   available to the algorithms if they were running on the same machine as the
>   node ([PR#461](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/461),
>   [Issue#162](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/162)).
> * For two-factor authentication, the information given to the authenticator
>   app has been updated to include a clearer description of the server and
>   username ([PR#483](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/483),
>   [Issue#405](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/405)).
> * Added the option to run an algorithm without passing data to it using the
>   CSV wrapper ([PR#465](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/465))
> * In the UI, when users are about to create a task, they will now be shown
>   which nodes relevant to the task are offline
>   ([PR#97](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6-UI/pull/97),
>   [Issue#96](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6-UI/issues/96)).

* **Change**

> * The `docker` dependency is updated, so that `docker.pull()` now pulls
>   the default tag if no tag is specified, instead of all tags
>   ([PR#481](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/481),
>   [Issue#473](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/473)).
> * If a node cannot authenticate to the server because the server cannot be
>   found, the user now gets a clearer error message([PR#480](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/480),
>   [Issue#460](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/460)).
> * The default role 'Organization admin' has been updated: it now allows to
>   create nodes for their own organization
>   ([PR#489](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/489)).
> * The release pipeline has been updated to 1) release to PyPi as last step (
>   since that is irreversible), 2) create release branches, 3) improve the
>   check on the version tag, and 4) update some soon-to-be-deprecated commands
>   ([PR#488](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/488).
> * Not all nodes are alerted any more when a node comes online
>   ([PR#490](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/490)).
> * Added instructions to the UI on how to report bugs
>   ([PR#100](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6-UI/pull/100),
>   [Issue#57](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6-UI/issues/57)).

* **Bugfix**

> * Newer images were not automatically pulled from harbor on node or server
>   startup. This has been fixed ([PR#482](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/482),
>   [Issue#471](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/471)).

## 3.6.1

*12 january 2023*

* **Feature**

> * Algorithm containers can be killed from the client. This can be done
>   for a specific task or it possible to kill all tasks running at a specific
>   node ([PR#417](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/417),
>   [Issue#167](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/167)).
> * Added a `status` field for an algorithm, that tracks if an algorithm has
>   yet to start, is started, has finished, or has failed. In the latter case,
>   it also indicates how/when the algorithm failed
>   ([PR#417](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/417)).
> * The UI has been connected to the socket, and gives messages about node
>   and task status changes ([UI PR#84](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6-UI/pull/84),
>   [UI Issue #73](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6-UI/issues/73)). There
>   are also new permissions for socket events on the server to authorize users
>   to see events from their (or all) collaborations
>   ([PR#417](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/417)).
> * It is now possible to create tasks in the UI (UI version >3.6.0). Note that
>   all tasks are then JSON serialized and you will not be able to run tasks
>   in an encrypted collaboration (as that would require uploading a private
>   key to a browser) (PR#90).
>
>   Warning
>
>   If you want to run the UI Docker image, note that from this version
>   onwards, you have to define the `SERVER_URL` and `API_PATH`

> * There is a new multi-database wrapper that will forward a dictionary of all
>   node databases and their paths to the algorithm. This allows you to use
>   multiple databases in a single algorithm easily.
>   ([PR#424](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/424),
>   [Issue #398](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/398)).
> * New rules are now assigned automatically to the default root role. This
>   ensures that rules that are added in a new version are assigned to system
>   administrators, instead of them having to change the database
>   ([PR#456](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/456),
>   [Issue #442](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/442)).
> * There is a new command `vnode set-api-key` that facilitates putting your
>   API key into the node configuration file ([PR#428](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/418),
>   [Issue #259](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/259)).
> * Logging in the Python client has been improved: instead of all or nothing,
>   log level is now settable to one of debug, info, warn, error, critical
>   ([PR#453](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/453),
>   [Issue #340](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/340)).

>   clearer error messages than before ([PR#444](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/444),
>   [Issue #278](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/278)).

* **Change**

> * The node status (online/offline) is now checked periodically over the socket
>   connection via a ping/pong construction. This is an improvement over the
>   older version where a node's status was changed only when it connected or
>   disconnected ([PR#450](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/450),
>   [Issue #40](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/40)).
>
>   Warning
>
>   If a server upgrades to 3.6.1, the nodes should also be upgraded.
>   Otherwise, the node status will be incorrect and the logs will show
>   errors periodically with each attempted ping/pong.
> * It is no longer possible for any user to change the username of another
>   user, as this would be confusing for that user when logging in
>   ([PR#433](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/433),
>   [Issue #396](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/396)).
> * The server has shorter log messages when someone calls a non-existing route.
>   The resulting 404 exception is no longer logged ([PR#452](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/452),
>   [Issue #393](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/393)).
> * Removed old, unused scripts to start a node
>   ([PR#464](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/464)).

* **Bugfix**

> * Node was unable to pull images from Docker Hub; this has been corrected.
>   ([PR#432](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/432),
>   [Issue#422](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/422)).
> * File-based database extensions were always converted to `.csv` when they
>   were mounted to a node. Now, files keep their original file extensions
>   ([PR#426](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/426),
>   [Issue #397](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/397)).
> * When a node configuration defined a wrong VPN subnet, the VPN connection
>   didn't work but this was not detected until VPN was used. Now, the user is
>   alerted immediately and VPN is turned off
>   ([PR#444](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/444)).
> * If a user tries to write a node or server config file to a non-existing
>   directory, they are now getting a clear error message instead of an
>   incorrect one ([PR#455](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/455),
>   [Issue #1](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/1))
> * There was a circular import in the infrastructure code, which has now been
>   resolved ([PR#451](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/451),
>   [Issue #53](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/53)).
> * In PATCH `/user`, it was not possible to set some fields (e.g.

Note

Release 3.6.0 was skipped due to an issue in the release process.

## 3.5.2

*30 november 2022*

* **Bugfix**

> * Fix for automatic addition of column. This failed in some SQL
>   dialects because reserved keywords (i.e. 'user' for PostgresQL) were
>   not escaped
>   ([PR#415](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/415))
> * Correct installation order for uWSGI in node and server docker file
>   ([PR#414](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/414))

## 3.5.1

*30 november 2022*

* **Bugfix**

> * Backwards compatibility for which organization initiated a task
>   between v3.0-3.4 and v3.5
>   ([PR#412](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/413))
> * Fixed VPN client container. Entry script was not executable in Github
>   pipelines
>   ([PR#413](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/413))

## 3.5.0

*30 november 2022*

Warning

When upgrading to 3.5.0, you might need to add the **otp\_secret** column to
the **user** table manually in the database. This may be avoided by upgrading
to 3.5.2.

* **Feature**

> * Multi-factor authentication via TOTP has been added. Admins can enforce
>   that all users enable MFA
>   ([PR#376](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/376),
>   [Issue#355](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/355)).
> * You can now request all tasks assigned by a given user
>   ([PR#326](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/326),
>   [Issue#43](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/43)).
> * The server support email is now settable in the configuration
>   file, used to be fixed at `support@vantage6.ai`
>   ([PR#330](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/330),
>   [Issue#319](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/319)).
> * When pickles are used, more task info is shown in the node logs
>   ([PR#366](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/366),
>   [Issue#171](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/171)).

* **Change**

> * The `harbor2.vantag6.ai/infrastructure/algorithm-base:[TAG]` is
>   tagged with the vantage6-client version that is already in the
>   image ([PR#389](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/389),
>   [Issue#233](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/233)).
> * The infrastructure base image has been updated to improve build
>   time ([PR#406](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/406),
>   [Issue#250](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/250)).

## 3.4.2

*3 november 2022*

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed a bug in the local proxy server which made algorithm containers crash
>   in case the client.create\_new\_task method was used
>   ([PR#382](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/382)).
> * Fixed a bug where the node crashed when a non existing image was sent in a
>   task ([PR#375](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/375)).

## 3.4.0 & 3.4.1

*25 oktober 2022*

* **Feature**

> * Add columns to the SQL database on startup
>   ([PR#365](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/365),
>   [ISSUE#364](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/364)).
>   This simpifies the upgrading proces when a new column is added in
>   the new release, as you do no longer need to manually add columns.
>   When downgrading the columns will **not** be deleted.
> * Docker wrapper for Parquet files
>   ([PR#361](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/361),
>   [ISSUE#337](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/337)).
>   Parquet provides a way to store tabular data with the datatypes
>   included which is an advantage over CSV.
> * When the node starts, or when the client is verbose initialized a
>   banner to cite the vantage6 project is added
>   ([PR#359](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/359),
>   [ISSUE#356](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/356)).
> * In the client a waiting for results method is added
>   ([PR#325](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/325),
>   [ISSUE#8](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/8)).
>   Which allows you to automatically poll for results by using
>   `client.wait_for_results(...)`, for more info see
>   `help(client.wait_for_results)`.
> * Added Github releases
>   ([PR#358](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/358),
>   [ISSUE#357](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/357)).
> * Added option to filter GET `/role` by user id in the Python client
>   ([PR#328](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/328),
>   [ISSUE#213](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/213)).
>   E.g.: `client.role.list(user=...).`
> * In release process, build and release images for both ARM and x86
>   architecture.

* **Change**

> * Unused code removed from the Makefile
>   ([PR#324](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/357),
>   [ISSUE#284](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/284)).
> * Pandas version is frozen to version 1.3.5
>   ([PR#363](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/363) ,
>   [ISSUE#266](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/266)).

* **Bugfix**

> * Improve checks for non-existing resources in unittests
>   ([PR#320](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/320),
>   [ISSUE#265](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/265)).
>   Flask did not support negative ints, so the tests passed due to
>   another 404 response.
> * `client.node.list` does no longer filter by offline nodes
>   ([PR#321](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/321),
>   [ISSUE#279](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/279)).

Note

3.4.1 is a rebuild from 3.4.0 in which the all dependencies are fixed, as
the build led to a broken server image.

## 3.3.7

* **Bugfix**

> * The function `client.util.change_my_password()` was updated
>   ([Issue #333](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/333))

## 3.3.6

* **Bugfix**

> * Temporary fix for a bug that prevents the master container from
>   creating tasks in an encrypted collaboration. This temporary fix
>   disables the parallel encryption module in the local proxy. This
>   functionality will be restored in a future release.

Note

This version is also the first version where the User Interface is available
in the right version. From this point onwards, the user interface changes
will also be part of the release notes.

## 3.3.5

* **Feature**

> * The release pipeline has been expanded to automatically push new
>   Docker images of node/server to the harbor2 service.

* **Bugfix**

> * The VPN IP address for a node was not saved by the server using
>   the PATCH `/node` endpoint, while this functionality is required
>   to use the VPN

Note

Note that 3.3.4 was only released on PyPi and that version is identical
to 3.3.5. That version was otherwise skipped due to a temporary mistake
in the release pipeline.

## 3.3.3

* **Bugfix**

> * Token refresh was broken for both users and nodes.
>   ([Issue#306](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/306),
>   [PR#307](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/307))
> * Local proxy encrpytion was broken. This prefented algorithms from
>   creating sub tasks when encryption was enabled.
>   ([Issue#305](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/305),
>   [PR#308](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/308))

## 3.3.2

* **Bugfix**

> * `vpn_client_image` and `network_config_image` are settable
>   through the node configuration file.
>   ([PR#301](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/301),
>   [Issue#294](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/294))
> * The option `--all` from `vnode stop` did not stop the node
>   gracefully. This has been fixed. It is possible to force the nodes
>   to quit by using the `--force` flag.
>   ([PR#300](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/300),
>   [Issue#298](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/298))
> * Nodes using a slow internet connection (high ping) had issues with
>   connecting to the websocket channel.
>   ([PR#299](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/299),
>   [Issue#297](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/297))

## 3.3.1

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed faulty error status codes from the `/collaboration`
>   endpoint
>   ([PR#287](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/287)).
> * *Default* roles are always returned from the `/role` endpoint.
>   This fixes the error when a user was assigned a *default* role but
>   could not reach anything (as it could not view its own role)
>   ([PR#286](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/286)).
> * Performance upgrade in the `/organization` endpoint. This caused
>   long delays when retrieving organization information when the
>   organization has many tasks
>   ([PR#288](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/288)).
> * Organization admins are no longer allowed to create and delete
>   nodes as these should be managed at collaboration level.
>   Therefore, the collaboration admin rules have been extended to
>   include create and delete nodes rules
>   ([PR#289](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/289)).
> * Fixed some issues that made `3.3.0` incompatible with `3.3.1`
>   ([Issue#285](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/285)).

## 3.3.0

* **Feature**

> * Login requirements have been updated. Passwords are now required
>   to have sufficient complexity (8+ characters, and at least 1
>   uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit, 1 special character). Also, after
>   5 failed login attempts, a user account is blocked for 15 minutes
>   (these defaults can be changed in a server config file).
> * Added endpoint `/password/change` to allow users to change their
>   password using their current password as authentication. It is no
>   longer possible to change passwords via `client.user.update()`
>   or via a PATCH `/user/{id}` request.
> * Added the default roles ‘viewer’, ‘researcher’, ‘organization
>   admin’ and ‘collaboration admin’ to newly created servers. These
>   roles may be assigned to users of any organization, and should
>   help users with proper permission assignment.
> * Added option to filter get all roles for a specific user id in the
>   GET `/role` endpoint.
> * RabbitMQ has support for multiple servers when using
>   `vserver start`. It already had support for multiple servers
>   when deploying via a Docker compose file.
> * When exiting server logs or node logs with Ctrl+C, there is now an
>   additional message alerting the user that the server/node is still
>   running in the background and how they may stop them.

* **Change**

> * Node proxy server has been updated
> * Updated PyJWT and related dependencies for improved JWT security.
> * When nodes are trying to use a wrong API key to authenticate, they
>   now receive a clear message in the node logs and the node exits
>   immediately.
> * When using `vserver import`, API keys must now be provided for
>   the nodes you create.
> * Moved all swagger API docs from YAML files into the code. Also,
>   corrected errors in them.
> * API keys are created with UUID4 instead of UUID1. This prevents
>   that UUIDs created milliseconds apart are not too similar.
> * Rules for users to edit tasks were never used and have therefore
>   been deleted.

* **Bugfix**

> * In the Python client, `client.organization.list()` now shows
>   pagination metadata by default, which is consistent all other
>   `list()` statements.
> * When not providing an API key in `vnode new`, there used to be
>   an unclear error message. Now, we allow specifying an API key
>   later and provide a clearer error message for any other keys with
>   inadequate values.
> * It is now possible to provide a name when creating a name, both
>   via the Python client as via the server.
> * A GET `/role` request crashed if parameter `organization_id`
>   was defined but not `include_root`. This has been resolved.
> * Users received an ‘unexpected error’ when performing a GET
>   `/collaboration?organization_id=<id>` request and they didn’t
>   have global collaboration view permission. This was fixed.
> * GET `/role/<id>` didn’t give an error if a role didn’t exist.
>   Now it does.

## 3.2.0

* **Feature**

> * Horizontal scaling for the vantage6-server instance by adding
>   support for RabbitMQ.
> * It is now possible to connect other docker containers to the
>   private algorithm network. This enables you to attach services to
>   the algorithm network using the `docker_services` setting.
> * Many additional select and filter options on API endpoints, see
>   swagger docs endpoint (`/apidocs`). The new options have also
>   been added to the Python client.
> * Users are now always able to view their own data
> * Usernames can be changed though the API

* **Bugfix**

> * (Confusing) SQL errors are no longer returned from the API.
> * Clearer error message when an organization has multiple nodes for
>   a single collaboration.
> * Node no longer tries to connect to the VPN if it has no
>   `vpn_subnet` setting in its configuration file.
> * Fix the VPN configuration file renewal
> * Superusers are no longer able to post tasks to collaborations its
>   organization does not participate in. Note that superusers were
>   never able to view the results of such tasks.
> * It is no longer possible to post tasks to organization which do
>   not have a registered node attach to the collaboration.
> * The `vnode create-private-key` command no longer crashes if the
>   ssh directory does not exist.
> * The client no longer logs the password
> * The version of the `alpine` docker image (that is used to set up
>   algorithm runs with VPN) was fixed. This prevents that many
>   versions of this image are downloaded by the node.
> * Improved reading of username and password from docker registry,
>   which can be capitalized differently depending on the docker
>   version.
> * Fix error with multiple-database feature, where default is now
>   used if specific database is not found

## 3.1.0

* **Feature**

> * Algorithm-to-algorithm communication can now take place over
>   multiple ports, which the algorithm developer can specify in the
>   Dockerfile. Labels can be assigned to each port, facilitating
>   communication over multiple channels.
> * Multi-database support for nodes. It is now also possible to
>   assign multiple data sources to a single node in Petronas; this
>   was already available in Harukas 2.2.0. The user can request a
>   specific data source by supplying the *database* argument when
>   creating a task.
> * The CLI commands `vserver new` and `vnode new` have been
>   extended to facilitate configuration of the VPN server.
> * Filter options for the client have been extended.
> * Roles can no longer be used across organizations (except for roles
>   in the default organization)
> * Added `vnode remove` command to uninstall a node. The command
>   removes the resources attached to a node installation
>   (configuration files, log files, docker volumes etc).
> * Added option to specify configuration file path when running
>   `vnode create-private-key`.

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed swagger docs
> * Improved error message if docker is not running when a node is
>   started
> * Improved error message for `vserver version` and
>   `vnode version` if no servers or nodes are running
> * Patching user failed if users had zero roles - this has been
>   fixed.
> * Creating roles was not possible for a user who had permission to
>   create roles only for their own organization - this has been
>   corrected.

## 3.0.0

* **Feature**

> * Direct algorithm-to-algorithm communication has been added. Via a
>   VPN connection, algorithms can exchange information with one
>   another.
> * Pagination is added. Metadata is provided in the headers by
>   default. It is also possible to include them in the output body by
>   supplying an additional parameter`include=metadata`.
>   Parameters `page` and `per_page` can be used to paginate. The
>   following endpoints are enabled:
>   + GET `/result`
>   + GET `/collaboration`
>   + GET `/collaboration/{id}/organization`
>   + GET `/collaboration/{id}/node`
>   + GET `/collaboration/{id}/task`
>   + GET `/organization`
>   + GET `/role`
>   + GET `/role/{id}/rule`
>   + GET `/rule`
>   + GET `/task`
>   + GET `/task/{id}/result`
>   + GET `/node`
> * API keys are encrypted in the database
> * Users cannot shrink their own permissions by accident
> * Give node permission to update public key
> * Dependency updates

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed database connection issues
> * Don’t allow users to be assigned to non-existing organizations by
>   root
> * Fix node status when node is stopped and immediately started up
> * Check if node names are allowed docker names

## 2.3.0 - 2.3.4

* **Feature**

> * Allows for horizontal scaling of the server instance by adding
>   support for RabbitMQ. Note that this has not been released for
>   version 3(!)

* **Bugfix**

> * Performance improvements on the `/organization` endpoint

## 2.2.0

* **Feature**

> * Multi-database support for nodes. It is now possible to assign
>   multiple data sources to a single node. The user can request a
>   specific data source by supplying the *database* argument when
>   creating a task.
> * The mailserver now supports TLS and SSL options

* **Bugfix**

> * Nodes are now disconnected more gracefully. This fixes the issue
>   that nodes appear offline while they are in fact online
> * Fixed a bug that prevented deleting a node from the collaboration
> * A role is now allowed to have zero rules
> * Some http error messages have improved
> * Organization fields can now be set to an empty string

## 2.1.2 & 2.1.3

* **Bugfix**

> * Changes to the way the application interacts with the database.
>   Solves the issue of unexpected disconnects from the DB and thereby
>   freezing the application.

## 2.1.1

* **Bugfix**

> * Updating the country field in an organization works again\
> * The `client.result.list(...)` broke when it was not able to
>   deserialize one of the in- or outputs.

## 2.1.0

* **Feature**

> * Custom algorithm environment variables can be set using the
>   `algorithm_env` key in the configuration file. [See this Github
>   issue](https://github.com/IKNL/vantage6-node/issues/32).
> * Support for non-file-based databases on the node. [See this Github
>   issue](https://github.com/IKNL/vantage6/issues/66).
> * Added flag `--attach` to the `vserver start` and
>   `vnode start` command. This directly attaches the log to the
>   console.
> * Auto updating the node and server instance is now limited to the
>   major version. [See this Github
>   issue](https://github.com/IKNL/vantage6/issues/65).
>   + e.g. if you’ve installed the Trolltunga version of the CLI you
>     will always get the Trolltunga version of the node and server.
>   + Infrastructure images are now tagged using their version major.
>     (e.g. `trolltunga` or `harukas` )
>   + It is still possible to use intermediate versions by specifying
>     the `--image` option when starting the node or server.
>     (e.g. `vserver start --image harbor.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/server:2.0.0.post1`
>     )

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed issue where node crashed if the database did not exist on
>   startup. [See this Github
>   issue](https://github.com/IKNL/vantage6/issues/67).

## 2.0.0.post1

* **Bugfix**

> * Fixed a bug that prevented the usage of secured registry
>   algorithms

## 2.0.0

* **Feature**

> * Role/rule based access control
>   + Roles consist of a bundle of rules. Rules profided access to
>     certain API endpoints at the server.
>   + By default 3 roles are created: 1) Container, 2) Node, 3) Root.
>     The root role is assigned to the root user on the first run.
>     The root user can assign rules and roles from there.
> * Major update on the *python*-client. The client also contains
>   management tools for the server (i.e. to creating users,
>   organizations and managing permissions. The client can be imported
>   from `from vantage6.client import Client` .
> * You can use the agrument `verbose` on the client to output
>   status messages. This is usefull for example when working with
>   Jupyter notebooks.
> * Added CLI `vserver version` , `vnode version` ,
>   `vserver-local version` and `vnode-local version` commands to
>   report the version of the node or server they are running
> * The logging contains more information about the current setup, and
>   refers to this documentation and our Discourd channel

* **Bugfix**

> * Issue with the DB connection. Session management is updated. Error
>   still occurs from time to time but can be reset by using the
>   endpoint `/health/fix` . This will be patched in a newer
>   version.

## 1.2.3

* **Feature**

> * The node is now compatible with the Harbor v2.0 API

## 1.2.2

* **Bug fixes**

> * Fixed a bug that ignored the `--system` flag from
>   `vnode start`
> * Logging output muted when the `--config` option is used in
>   `vnode start`
> * Fixed config folder mounting point when the option `--config`
>   option is used in `vnode start`

## 1.2.1

* **Bug fixes**

> * starting the server for the first time resulted in a crash as the
>   root user was not supplied with an email address.
> * Algorithm containers could still access the internet through their
>   host. This has been patched.

## 1.2.0

* **Features**

> * Cross language serialization. Enabling algorithm developers to
>   write algorithms that are not language dependent.
> * Reset password is added to the API. For this purpose two endpoints
>   have been added: `/recover/lost`and `recover/reset` . The
>   server config file needs to extended to be connected to a
>   mail-server in order to make this work.
> * User table in the database is extended to contain an email address
>   which is mandatory.

* **Bug fixes**

> * Collaboration name needs to be unique
> * API consistency and bug fixes:
>   + GET `organization` was missing domain key
>   + PATCH `/organization` could not patch domain
>   + GET `/collaboration/{id}/node` has been made consistent with
>     `/node`
>   + GET `/collaboration/{id}/organization` has been made
>     consistent with `/organization`
>   + PATCH `/user` root-user was not able to update users
>   + DELETE `/user` root-user was not able to delete users
>   + GET `/task` null values are now consistent: `[]` is
>     replaced by `null`
>   + POST, PATCH, DELETE `/node` root-user was not able to perform
>     these actions
>   + GET `/node/{id}/task` output is made consistent with the

* **other**

> * `questionairy` dependency is updated to 1.5.2
> * `vantage6-toolkit` repository has been merged with the
>   `vantage6-client` as they were very tight coupled.

## 1.1.0

* **Features**

> * new command `vnode clean` to clean up temporary docker volumes
>   that are no longer used
> * Version of the individual packages are printed in the console on
>   startup
> * Custom task and log directories can be set in the configuration
>   file
> * Improved **CLI** messages
> * Docker images are only pulled if the remote version is newer. This
>   applies both to the node/server image and the algorithm images
> * Client class names have been simplified (`UserClientProtocol` ->
>   `Client`)

* **Bug fixes**

> * Removed defective websocket watchdog. There still might be
>   disconnection issues from time to time.

## 1.0.0

* **Updated Command Line Interface (CLI)**

> * The commands `vnode list` , `vnode start` and the new
>   command`vnode attach` are aimed to work with multiple nodes at
>   a single machine.
> * System and user-directories can be used to store configurations by
>   using the `--user/--system` options. The node stores them by
>   default at user level, and the server at system level.
> * Current status (online/offline) of the nodes can be seen using
>   `vnode list` , which also reports which environments are
>   available per configuration.
> * Developer container has been added which can inject the container
>   with the source. `vnode start --develop [source]`. Note that
>   this Docker image needs to be build in advance from the
>   `development.Dockerfile` and tag `devcon`.
> * `vnode config_file` has been replaced by `vnode files` which
>   not only outputs the config file location but also the database
>   and log file location.

* **New database model**

> * Improved relations between models, and with that, an update of the Python
>   API.
> * Input for the tasks is now stored in the result table. This was
>   required as the input is encrypted individually for each
>   organization (end-to-end encryption (E2EE) between organizations).
> * The `Organization` model has been extended with the
>   `public_key` (String) field. This field contains the public key
>   from each organization, which is used by the E2EE module.
> * The `Collaboration` model has been extended with the
>   `encrypted` (Boolean) field which keeps track if all messages
>   (tasks, results) need to be E2EE for this specific collaboration.
> * The `Task` keeps track of the initiator (organization) of the
>   organization. This is required to encrypt the results for the
>   initiator.

* **End to end encryption**

> * All messages between all organizations are by default be
>   encrypted.
> * Each node requires the private key of the organization as it needs
>   to be able to decrypt incoming messages. The private key should be
>   specified in the configuration file using the `private_key`
>   label.
> * In case no private key is specified, the node generates a new key
>   an uploads the public key to the server.
> * If a node starts (using `vnode start`), it always checks if the
>   `public_key` on the server matches the private key the node is
>   currently using.
> * In case your organization has multiple nodes running they should
>   all point to the same private key.
> * Users have to encrypt the input and decrypt the output, which can
>   be simplified by using our client `vantage6.client.Client` \_\_
>   for Python \_\_ or `vtg::Client` \_\_ for R.
> * Algorithms are not concerned about encryption as this is handled
>   at node level.

* **Algorithm container isolation**

> * Containers have no longer an internet connection, but are
>   connected to a private docker network.
> * Master containers can access the central server through a local
>   proxy server which is both connected to the private docker network
>   as the outside world. This proxy server also takes care of the
>   encryption of the messages from the algorithms for the intended
>   receiving organization.
> * In case a single machine hosts multiple nodes, each node is
>   attached to its own private Docker network.

* **Temporary Volumes**

> * Each algorithm mounts temporary volume, which is linked to the
>   node and the `job_id` of the task
> * The mounting target is specified in an environment variable
>   `TEMPORARY_FOLDER`. The algorithm can write anything to this
>   directory.
> * These volumes need to be cleaned manually.
>   (`docker rm VOLUME_NAME`)
> * Successive algorithms only have access to the volume if they share
>   the same `job_id` . Each time a **user** creates a task, a new
>   `job_id` is issued. If you need to share information between
>   containers, you need to do this through a master container. If a
>   central container creates a task, all child tasks will get the
>   same `job_id`.

* **RESTful API**

> * All RESTful API output is HATEOS formatted.
>   **(**[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)**)**

* **Local Proxy Server**

> * Algorithm containers no longer receive an internet connection.
>   They can only communicate with the central server through a local
>   proxy service.
> * It handles encryption for certain endpoints (i.e. `/task`, the
>   input or `/result` the results)

* **Dockerized the Node**

> * All node code is run from a Docker container. Build versions can
>   be found at our Docker repository:
>   `harbor.distributedlearning.ai/infrastructure/node` . Specific
>   version can be pulled using tags.
> * For each running node, a Docker volume is created in which the
>   data, input and output is stored. The name of the Docker volume
>   is: `vantage-NODE_NAME-vol` . This volume is shared with all
>   incoming algorithm containers.
> * Each node is attached to the public network and a private network:
>   `vantage-NODE_NAME-net`.
