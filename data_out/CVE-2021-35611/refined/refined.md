Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the processing of the `Content-Length` HTTP header. This inadequate validation leads to a memory exhaustion condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper input validation: The application fails to validate the `Content-Length` HTTP header, allowing a malicious user to provide a large value that results in a denial-of-service.
*   Memory exhaustion: The lack of validation allows an attacker to trigger a memory exhaustion condition by providing a large value for the `Content-Length` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition on the affected Oracle E-Business Suite system. This could render the application or service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests that include a malicious `Content-Length` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning the attacker needs valid credentials for the Oracle E-Business Suite.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the processing of the `Content-Length` HTTP header within Oracle E-Business Suite.
*   The issue is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory exhaustion.
*   Oracle has released an update to address this vulnerability.
* The CVSS score is 4.3 with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L.
