| Bug ReportEnvironment OS: MacOS 13.4.1; Windows 11; Ubuntu 20.04 Zola version: 0.17.2 Expected Behavior Application should only search & serve files within the webserver's root folder. Current Behavior Custom implementation of a web server, used for development purposes & available via `zola serve` command is vulnerable to a directory traversal. `handle_request` function performs insufficient checks over the user-supplied path in a HTTP request to the server   [zola/src/cmd/serve.rs](https://github.com/getzola/zola/blob/695c17d2222e2ee3f83d304d0828265b1c7407cf/src/cmd/serve.rs#L120)  Line 120 in [695c17d](/getzola/zola/commit/695c17d2222e2ee3f83d304d0828265b1c7407cf)   |  | if !root.starts\_with(original\_root) { | | --- | --- |      The application only checks for a trusted path prefix, but does not actually fully resolve the path. Since the webroot directory is prepended to each path, this check will always be bypassed:  ``` let root_path = PathBuf::from("/trusted_prefix/../../some/arbitrary/path"); let trusted_prefix = "/trusted_prefix";  root_path.starts_with(trusted_prefix); <-- true  ```  Thus is possible to utilize path control sequences (`/`, `..`) to escape the webroot & read arbitrary files off the FS of the machines running `zola serve` command. Step to reproduce (UNIX)  0. Install zola 1. Run `zola init poc && cd poc` 2. Run `zola serve` 3. Use curl > 7.42 to trigger the path traversal via the following command: `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:1111/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd" -vvv`   Successful explotation should yield contents of the `/etc/passwd` file [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/54282598/255699159-c72ed3ea-c628-4d24-9c0c-b70ff280c537.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.98fuT5RonN1YG456Uv5heSE5KixmiVsp55JOHX8aEKs) |

**IMPORTANT: Please do not create a Pull Request adding a new feature without discussing it first.**

The place to discuss new features is the forum: <https://zola.discourse.group/>

If you want to add a new feature, please open a thread there first in the feature requests section.

Sanity check:

* Have you checked to ensure there aren't other open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pulls) for the same update/change?

## Code changes

(Delete or ignore this section for documentation changes)

* Are you doing the PR on the `next` branch?

If the change is a new feature or adding to/changing an existing one:

* Have you created/updated the relevant documentation page(s)?

Sorry, something went wrong.
