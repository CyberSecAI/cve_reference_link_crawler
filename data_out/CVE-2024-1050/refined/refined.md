Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `ajax_force_reset_password_delete_metas()` function within the "Import and export users and customers" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper capability checks before allowing users to execute the `ajax_force_reset_password_delete_metas()` function. This function is responsible for deleting all "force reset password" flags.
*   **Insecure AJAX Handler:** The AJAX handler for deleting the force password reset meta keys is accessible without proper permission checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Authenticated attackers with low-level access (like subscriber-level) can delete all "force reset password" flags from the database.
*   **Bypass Force Password Reset:** By deleting the flags, attackers can prevent users who are supposed to reset their passwords from being redirected to the password reset page, essentially bypassing the security measure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered through an AJAX request, making it accessible over the network.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in WordPress user with at least subscriber-level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a valid account on the WordPress site.
*   **Subscriber Level or Higher:** The attacker must be logged in as a user with at least the subscriber role to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site to send the malicious AJAX request.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was found in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.26.5.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.26.6 of the plugin by adding a capability check.
*   CVE-2024-34815 is a duplicate of this issue.
*   The fix for this issue includes adding `check_ajax_referer()` and `current_user_can()` to the function.
