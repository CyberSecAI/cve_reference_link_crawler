- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Eramba web application is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the custom filter function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the filter name field.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the filter name field, which will be executed when another user edits the filter, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with the ability to create filters. The attacker injects malicious javascript into the name field of a custom filter. The javascript is executed when another user views or edits the filter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid account on the Eramba application and be able to create custom filters.
