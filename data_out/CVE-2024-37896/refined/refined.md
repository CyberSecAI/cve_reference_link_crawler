Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ExportExcel` function in `server/service/system/sys_export_template.go` is vulnerable to SQL injection. The function takes user-provided input through the `order` parameter and directly injects it into a SQL query using `db.Order(order)`, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to sanitize user input before using it in a database query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: Attackers could gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- Data leakage: Attackers could extract confidential information from the database.
- Data manipulation: Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
- Complete compromise of the database server: In severe cases, attackers could potentially take control of the entire database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `/api/sysExportTemplate/exportExcel` API endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is `order`. This is part of the URL query parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send a request to the vulnerable API endpoint `/api/sysExportTemplate/exportExcel`.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `order` query parameter in the request.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with low-level privileges.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `gin-vue-admin` prior to 2.6.6.
- The patch for this vulnerability is commit `53d0338`.
- The code snippet provided in the advisory confirms that the `order` parameter is directly used in the `db.Order()` function, which results in the SQL injection.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 which is categorized as High severity.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) image shows how a malicious `order` parameter can be used to inject SQL commands.
