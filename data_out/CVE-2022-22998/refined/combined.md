## My Cloud Home Firmware Version 8.7.0-107

---

**WDC Tracking Number:** WDC-22009

**Published:** July 11, 2022

**Last Updated:** July 11, 2022

#### Description

My Cloud Home Firmware 8.7.0-107 is a major release containing updates to help improve the security of your My Cloud Home devices. Numerous changes were made to the operating system to comprehensively improve its security and to upgrade the user experience to support our latest technologies.

The base operating system has been upgraded from an Android based operating system to the Linux operating system to align with security and stability updates from Debian 10 “Buster”.

Additionally, the Linux kernel has been updated to 4.9.266.

Your My Cloud Home device will be automatically updated to reflect the latest firmware version.

**Product Impact**
**Minimum Fix Version**
**Last Updated**

My Cloud Home
8.7.0-107
July 8, 2022

My Cloud Home Duo
8.7.0-107
July 8, 2022

For more information on the latest security updates, see the [release notes](https://support-en.wd.com/app/products/downloads/release-notes/note_id/29476).

#### Advisory Summary

A vulnerability in the Linux kernel’s cgroup\_release\_agent\_write was addressed that could lead to escalation of privileges and bypass namespace isolation unexpectedly.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2022-0492](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0492)

Addressed an issue in OpenSSL that would make it possible to trigger an infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid elliptic curve parameters. Since certificate parsing takes place before the certificate signature verification process, this could lead to a denial-of-service attack.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2022-0778](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0778)

Addressed a memory copy vulnerability in the Linux Wi-Fi driver.

Addressed a command injection attack that could allow a malicious attacker on the same LAN to carry out a DNS spoofing attack via an unsecured HTTP call. This was done by removing the affected code from the product.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2022-22991](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22991), [CVE-2022-22994](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-22994)

Reported By: Martin Rakhmanov (@mrakhmanov) working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative

A vulnerability was discovered within the parsing of extended attributes (EA) metadata when opening a file in smbd. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users if they are allowed write access to file extended attributes. This vulnerability was addressed by removing the "fruit" VFS module from the list of configured VFS objects and by changing EA support configurations.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2021-44142](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-44142)

Reported By: Nguyen Hoang Thach (@hi\_im\_d4rkn3ss) and Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong (@st424204) working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative
