Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data within the `footer_data` setting. Specifically, the application was allowing arbitrary URLs to be embedded within the footer configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A privileged user could inject malicious JavaScript code into the footer data via the URL field. Since the application renders the footer, the injected code would execute in the context of other users' browsers, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
* **Lack of input validation:** The initial implementation allowed users to provide arbitrary strings, instead of validating the provided URLs as a security measure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other users.
*   **Session hijacking:**  An attacker could steal session cookies of other users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
*   **Data theft and manipulation:**  Attackers could steal sensitive data or modify data displayed to the affected users.
*   **Phishing and social engineering:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or impersonate legitimate site content.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A privileged user (e.g., administrator) would access the system's settings and modify the `footer_data` setting.
*   The attacker would inject a malicious URL that contains JavaScript code, masquerading it as a valid one, into the `footer_data`.
*   When another user views the footer, the embedded malicious JavaScript would execute, triggering the XSS vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a privileged user capable of modifying system settings.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious JavaScript and embed it into a URL.

**Changes introduced in the commit:**

The commit fixes the vulnerability by implementing the following:

*   **URL validation:**  The code now uses `isValidUrl` function to check if the provided URLs in the `footer_data` are valid. Invalid URLs are filtered out.
*   **Maximum item limit:** Footer data items are limited to 3.

**Additional details:**

* The commit message mentions "security: patch footer icon self-xss from privledged user", indicating a self-XSS vulnerability in the footer icons which was exploitable by privileged users.
* The code diff shows that the validation for footer data is now performed by filtering the items based on the `isValidUrl` before stringifying the array.
* The `isValidUrl` function verifies if the URL protocol is either `http:` or `https:` before deeming it valid.
