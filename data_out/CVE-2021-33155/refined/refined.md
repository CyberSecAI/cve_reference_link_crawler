- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The firmware for some Intel Wireless Bluetooth and Killer Bluetooth products does not properly validate input, leading to a potential vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can potentially cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via adjacent access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with adjacent access.
