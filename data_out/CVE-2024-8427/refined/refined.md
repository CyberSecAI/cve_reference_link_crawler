### Summary of Vulnerability Information:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the `save_global_settings` and `process_form_edit` functions of the Frontend Post Submission Manager Lite WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions before allowing them to modify the plugin's settings and forms through the `save_global_settings` and `process_form_edit` functions.
- The `admin_ajax_nonce_verify` function only checks for a valid nonce, but doesn't verify the user has the `manage_options` capability prior to version 1.2.3

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authenticated users with Subscriber-level access or higher can modify the plugin's settings and forms, which could potentially lead to unauthorized changes to the site's functionality and configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable `save_global_settings` and `process_form_edit` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an authenticated account on the WordPress site with at least Subscriber-level access.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted AJAX requests to the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The `admin_ajax_nonce_verify` function was missing a capability check, allowing any authenticated user with a valid nonce to call the vulnerable functions.
- The vulnerable functions `save_global_settings` and `process_form_edit` lack capability checks, allowing the modification of plugin settings and forms by unprivileged users.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.2.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.3 by adding `current_user_can('manage_options')` to `admin_ajax_nonce_verify` function.
