The Frontend Post Submission Manager Lite â€“ Frontend Posting WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_global_settings and process_form_edit functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update the plugin's settings and forms.
