Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9006

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `PASSOx` parameter in the `/admin/admin_invt2.php` script. The script directly writes the value of the `PASSOx` parameter into the `config/config_invt1.php` file without filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Code Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is PHP code injection. By crafting a malicious `PASSOx` parameter containing PHP code, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability exists due to the absence of input validation and sanitization of the `PASSOx` parameter before writing it to a configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to a wide range of malicious actions, including:
    - **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive data, including configuration files, databases, and user data.
    - **System Compromise:** Gaining complete control over the server.
    - **Malware Installation:** Deploying malware or malicious scripts.
    - **Website Defacement:** Altering the website's content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/admin_invt2.php` script.
- **`PASSOx` Parameter:** The malicious PHP code is embedded within the `PASSOx` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server running the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required** There is no mention of authentication required to send the malicious POST request to `/admin/admin_invt2.php`.

**Additional Details:**

- The `config/config_invt1.php` file, where the malicious code is written, is included by other PHP scripts in the application, leading to the execution of the injected code.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) HTTP POST request is provided that includes the injection of `phpinfo();` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported in issue #74 on the GitHub repository for the project `123solar`.
- The fix implemented involved adding a check to ensure that the PASSOx parameter is numeric, which mitigates the code injection vulnerability.
