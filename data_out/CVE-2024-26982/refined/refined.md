The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26982.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked inode number of zero in the Squashfs filesystem. When `fill_meta_index()` encounters a data read error, it invalidates the newly returned empty metadata index by setting the inode number of the index to zero. Later, `locate_meta_index()` returns this invalid index because it matches the inode number of zero, which leads to an out-of-bounds access because the metadata index has not been properly filled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to the use of an invalid metadata index.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code does not validate the inode number, allowing a zero value to propagate and cause issues.
- **Incorrect error handling:** Failure to handle data read errors during metadata index filling can leave the metadata index in an inconsistent state.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** An attacker can potentially trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash, information leak, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering a sequence of events that causes a data read error during metadata index filling, which in turn leads to the use of an invalid metadata index and the out-of-bounds read when `fill_meta_index` is called again with another read operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the capability to cause a data read error while the Squashfs filesystem is being accessed in a way that would trigger metadata allocation. This suggests an attacker might be able to control or manipulate the data being read from the filesystem.
