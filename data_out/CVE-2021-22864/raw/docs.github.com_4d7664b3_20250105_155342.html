A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to read files on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.1.8 and was fixed in 3.1.8, 3.0.16, and 2.22.22. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-22867. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22868. </p></li><li class="f4"><p><strong>MEDIUM:</strong> An improper access control vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed a workflow job to execute in a self-hosted runner group it should not have had access to. This affects customers using self-hosted runner groups for access control. A repository with access to one enterprise runner group could access all of the enterprise runner groups within the organization because of improper authentication checks during the request. This could cause code to be run unintentionally by the incorrect runner group. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server versions from 3.0.0 to 3.0.15 and 3.1.0 to 3.1.7 and was fixed in 3.0.16 and 3.1.8 releases. It has been assigned CVE-2021-22869. </p></li></ul></div><div class="py-6 d-block d-xl-flex border-bottom"><ul class=""><h3>Bug fixes</h3><li class="f4"><p>Resque worker counts were displayed incorrectly during maintenance mode. </p></li><li class="f4"><p>Allocated memcached memory could be zero in clustering mode. </p></li><li class="f4"><p>Fixes GitHub Pages builds so they take into account the NO_PROXY setting of the appliance.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization, but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.x prior to 3.0.7 and 2.22.x prior to 2.22.13. It was fixed in versions 3.0.7 and 2.22.13. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22866 and was reported via the <a href="https://bounty.github.com/">GitHub Bug Bounty Program</a>.</p></li><li class="f4"><p>Packages have been updated to

By establishing this incorrect reference in a PR, the restrictions that limit the Actions secrets sent a workflow from forks could be bypassed.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization, but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended.

All permissions being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization, but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended.

For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-07-01-codeql-code-scanning-now-recognizes-more-sources-and-uses-of-untrusted-user-data/).","{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} now shows `security-severity` levels for CodeQL security alerts. You can configure which `security-severity` levels will cause a check failure for a pull request. The severity level of security alerts can be `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`. By default, any {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with a `security-severity` of `critical` or `high` will cause a pull request check failure. \n\nAdditionally, you can now also configure which severity levels will cause a pull request check to fail for non-security alerts. You can configure this behavior at the repository level, and define whether alerts with the severity `error`, `warning`, or `note` will cause a pull request check to fail. By default, non-security {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with a severity of `error` will cause a pull request check failure.\n\nFor more information see \"[Defining which alert severity levels cause pull request check failure](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure).\"\n\n![List of code scanning alerts with security levels](/assets/images/enterprise/3.2/release-notes/code-scanning-alerts.png)\n","Improvements to the branch filter for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts make it clearer which {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts are being displayed on the alerts page. By default, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts are filtered to show alerts for the default branch of the repository only. You can use the branch filter to display the alerts on any of the non-default branches. Any branch filter that has been applied is shown in the search bar.\n\nThe search syntax has also been simplified to `branch:\u003cbranch name\u003e`. This syntax can be used multiple times in the search bar to filter on multiple branches. The previous syntax, `ref:refs/heads/\u003cbranch name\u003e`, is still supported, so any saved URLs will continue to work.\n","Free text search is now available for code scanning alerts. You can search code scanning results to quickly find specific alerts without having to know exact search terms. The search is applied across the alert's name, description, and help text. The syntax is:\n\n- A single word returns all matches.\n- Multiple search words returns matches to either word.\n- Words in double quotes returns exact matches.\n- The keyword 'AND' returns matches to multiple words.\n","{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} added patterns for 23 new service providers.

In addition, admin users can check whether {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} is currently enabled for a repository by using a `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` request.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization, but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended.
