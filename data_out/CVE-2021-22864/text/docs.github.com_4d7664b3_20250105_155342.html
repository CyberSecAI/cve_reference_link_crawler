## Enterprise Server 3.0.16

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.16](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.0.16/download)

September 24, 2021

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.0.25) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### Security fixes

* **HIGH:** A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to read files on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.1.8 and was fixed in 3.1.8, 3.0.16, and 2.22.22. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-22867. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22868.
* **MEDIUM:** An improper access control vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed a workflow job to execute in a self-hosted runner group it should not have had access to. This affects customers using self-hosted runner groups for access control. A repository with access to one enterprise runner group could access all of the enterprise runner groups within the organization because of improper authentication checks during the request. This could cause code to be run unintentionally by the incorrect runner group. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server versions from 3.0.0 to 3.0.15 and 3.1.0 to 3.1.7 and was fixed in 3.0.16 and 3.1.8 releases. It has been assigned CVE-2021-22869.

### Bug fixes

* Resque worker counts were displayed incorrectly during maintenance mode.
* Allocated memcached memory could be zero in clustering mode.
* Fixes GitHub Pages builds so they take into account the NO\_PROXY setting of the appliance. This is relevant to appliances configured with an HTTP proxy only. (update 2021-09-30)
* The GitHub Connect configuration of the source instance was always restored to new instances even when the `--config` option for `ghe-restore` was not used. This would lead to a conflict with the GitHub Connect connection and license synchronization if both the source and destination instances were online at the same time. The fix also requires updating backup-utils to 3.2.0 or higher. [updated: 2021-11-18]

### Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.

### Security fixes

* **HIGH:** A UI misrepresentation vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed more permissions to be granted during a GitHub App's user-authorization web flow than was displayed to the user during approval. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization, but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.x prior to 3.0.7 and 2.22.x prior to 2.22.13. It was fixed in versions 3.0.7 and 2.22.13. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22866 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.

### Bug fixes

* Quotes included in Actions or Packages storage configuration could cause errors.
* Custom pre-receive hooks could fail due to too restrictive file size or number of open file limits.
* Orchestrator auto failover could be enabled during the phase of config apply.
* Users with maintainer permissions to a repository were shown an e-mail verification warning instead of a successful page build on the repository Pages settings page.
* The code owner of a wildcard rule would be incorrectly added to the list of owners for the code owners badge even if a later rule took precedence for that path.
* OpenAPI documentation referred to an invalid header.
* When creating or editing a pre-receive hook, a race condition in the user interface meant that after selecting a repository, files within the repository were sometimes not populated in files dropdown.

### Changes

* Added logging for config change on HAProxy reload.
* Added logging for repository creation.

### Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.

### Security fixes

* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed access tokens generated from a GitHub App's [web authentication flow](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#web-application-flow) to read private repository metadata via the REST API without having been granted the appropriate permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. The private repository metadata returned would be limited to repositories owned by the user the token identifies. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.4 and was fixed in versions 3.0.4, 2.22.10, 2.21.18. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22865 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.

### Bug fixes

* When maintenance mode was enabled, some services continued to be listed as "active processes" even though they were expected to be running, and should not have been listed.
* After upgrading from 2.22.x to 3.0.x with GitHub Actions enabled, the self-hosted runner version was not updated and no self-hosted updates were made.
* Old GitHub Pages builds were not cleaned up leading to increased disk usage.
* `memcached` was not running on active replicas.
* Upgrade failed when updating file permissions when GitHub Actions was enabled.
* A timezone set on GitHub Enterprise 11.10.x or earlier was not being used by some services which were defaulting to UTC time.
* Services were not transitioning to new log files as part of log rotation, resulting in increased disk usage.
* The `ghe-saml-mapping-csv` command-line utility produced a warning message.
* The label on search results for internal repositories was shown as "Private" instead of "Internal".

### Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.

## Enterprise Server 3.0.3

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.3](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.0.3/download)

March 23, 2021

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.0.25) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Downloads have been disabled due to a major bug affecting multiple customers. A fix will be available in the next patch.

### Security fixes

* **HIGH:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to override environment variables leading to code execution on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.3 and was fixed in 3.0.3, 2.22.9, and 2.21.17. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22864.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.

### Bug fixes

* Running `ghe-cluster-config-init` could cause a cluster to become inoperable.
* Resolving merge conflicts in the GUI would fail when custom pre-receive hooks are configured on the repository.
* `launch-deployer` and `launch-receiver` were logging at DEBUG level and filling logs with unnecessary information.
* Systemd could lose track of HAProxy's PID.
* When Actions was configured to use S3 storage, the logs for an action would sometimes fail to load.
* The mysql-failover warning was displayed indefinitely after a successful failover.
* The `ghe-cluster-config-init` run was not fully accounting for the exit code of background jobs leading to improper handling of preflight checks.
* When enabling GitHub Actions, initialization could fail silently.
* When vulnerability alerting is enabled, upgrades to the 3.0 series would fail.
* Jobs related to Codespaces were being enqueued leading to an accumulation of unprocessed jobs.

### Changes

* Use a relative number for consul and nomad `bootstrap_expect` allowing for a cluster to bootstrap even if a handful of nodes are down.
* Logs will rotate based on size in addition to time.
* Added kafka-lite to the `ghe-cluster-status` command.

### Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* When maintenance mode is enabled, some services continue to be listed as "active processes". The services identified are expected to run during maintenance mode. If you experience this issue and are unsure, contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* Jupyter Notebook rendering in the web UI may fail if the notebook includes non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.
* reStructuredText (RST) rendering in the web UI may fail and instead display raw RST markup text.
* Old builds of Pages are not cleaned up, which could fill up the user disk (`/data/user/`).
* When deleting a branch after merging a pull request, an error message appears although the branch deletion succeeds.
* Log rotation may fail to signal services to transition to new log files, leading to older log files continuing to be used, and eventual root disk space exhaustion.
  To remedy and/or prevent this issue, run the following commands in the [administrative shell](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/configuration/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh) (SSH), or contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://support.github.com/) for assistance:

  ```
  printf "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/share/enterprise:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n29,59 * * * * root /usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf\n" | sudo sponge /etc/cron.d/logrotate
  sudo /usr/sbin/logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

  ```
* When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, GitHub Enterprise Server may still route GitHub Pages requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of GitHub Pages for users.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

### Security fixes

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.

### Bug fixes

* During a backup an error "Warning: One or more storage objects were not found on the source appliance." was occurring when attempting to clean up purgeable storage objects.
* Dependency graph failed to parse `yarn.lock` JavaScript manifest files, resulting in HTTP 500 errors in logs.
* Disabling GitHub Actions would sometimes fail.
* Custom pre-receive hooks weren't allowed to write to `/tmp`, preventing some scripts from running correctly.
* Systemd journal logs were duplicated in multiple places.
* A timezone set on GitHub Enterprise 11.10.x or earlier was reset to UTC time after upgrading to 3.0 which caused timestamps to shift in some instances.
* Clicking "Publish your first package" in the packages sidebar on a repository would lead to an empty page.
* A site admin could get a 500 error page while trying to view issues referenced from private repositories.
* After disabling GitHub Packages, some organization pages would return an HTTP 500 error response.
* Importing of repository archives from GitHub Enterprise Server that are missing repository files would fail with an error.
* Repository [deploy keys](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys) were unable to be used with repositories containing LFS objects.
* In the packages sidebar of a repository, the Docker icon was gray and a tool tip displayed "This service is deprecated".
* Webhooks configured with a content type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` did not receive query parameters in the POST request body.
* Users could dismiss a mandatory message without checking all checkboxes.
* In some cases after upgrading from a 2.22.X instance, the web interface assets were missing and the page would not render correctly.
* Running `ghe-config-apply` could time out with `Failure waiting for nomad jobs to apply` due to `'job' stanza not found`.

### Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* When maintenance mode is enabled, some services continue to be listed as "active processes". The services identified are expected to run during maintenance mode. If you experience this issue and are unsure, contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* Jupyter Notebook rendering in the web UI may fail if the notebook includes non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.
* reStructuredText (RST) rendering in the web UI may fail and instead display raw RST markup text.
* Old builds of Pages are not cleaned up, which could fill up the user disk (`/data/user/`).
* When deleting a branch after merging a pull request, an error message appears although the branch deletion succeeds.
* Users may experience assets such as avatars not loading, or a failure to push/pull code. This may be caused by a PID mismatch in the `haproxy-cluster-proxy` service. To determine if you have an affected instance:

  **Single instance**

  1. Run this in the [administrative shell](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/configuration/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh) (SSH):

     ```
     if [ $(cat /var/run/haproxy-cluster-proxy.pid) -ne $(systemctl show --property MainPID --value haproxy-cluster-proxy) ]; then echo 'Main PID of haproxy-cluster-proxy does not match /var/run/haproxy-cluster-proxy.pid'; fi

     ```
  2. If it shows that there is a mismatch, reboot the instance.

  **Cluster or High Availability configuration**

  1. Run this in the [administrative shell](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/configuration/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh) (SSH):

     ```
     ghe-cluster-each -- 'if [ $(cat /var/run/haproxy-cluster-proxy.pid) -ne $(systemctl show --property MainPID --value haproxy-cluster-proxy) ]; then echo 'Main PID of haproxy-cluster-proxy does not match /var/run/haproxy-cluster-proxy.pid'; fi'

     ```
  2. If it shows one or more nodes are affected, reboot the affected nodes.
* When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, GitHub Enterprise Server may still route GitHub Pages requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of GitHub Pages for users.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
## Enterprise Server 3.0.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.0.1/download)

March 02, 2021

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.0.25) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

The minimum infrastructure requirements have increased for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0+. For more information, see "[About minimum requirements for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 and later](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server#about-minimum-requirements-for-github-enterprise-server-30-and-later)."

### Security fixes

* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed authenticated users of the instance to gain write access to unauthorized repositories via specifically crafted pull requests and REST API requests. An attacker would need to be able to fork the targeted repository, a setting that is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories. Branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22861. This issue was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in the GitHub Enterprise Server GraphQL API that allowed authenticated users of the instance to modify the maintainer collaboration permission of a pull request without proper authorization. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker would be able to gain access to head branches of pull requests opened on repositories of which they are a maintainer. Forking is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories and would prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22863. This issue was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed an authenticated user with the ability to fork a repository to disclose Actions secrets for the parent repository of the fork. This vulnerability existed due to a flaw that allowed the base reference of a pull request to be updated to point to an arbitrary SHA or another pull request outside of the fork repository. By establishing this incorrect reference in a PR, the restrictions that limit the Actions secrets sent a workflow from forks could be bypassed. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server versions 3.0.0, 3.0.0.rc2, and 3.0.0.rc1 and has been assigned CVE-2021-22862. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
* **MEDIUM:** GitHub Tokens from GitHub Pages builds could end up in logs.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.

### Bug fixes

* The load-balancer health checks in some cases could cause the babeld logs to fill up with errors about the PROXY protocol.
* The HTTP headers were not compliant with HTTP RFC standards in specific responses like 304 status for archives.
* On instances that host Python repositories with the Dependency Graph feature enabled, the instance could become unresponsive due to the root disk filling with error logs.
* An informational message was unintentionally logged as an error during GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities snapshots, which resulted in unnecessary emails being sent when backups were scheduled by cron jobs that listen for output to stderr.
* On VMWare ESX 6.7 the initial configuration could hang while creating host keys which left the instance inaccessible via SSH.
* When GitHub Actions was enabled, disabling maintenance mode in the management console failed.
* The Package creation setting was shown on the organization member settings page, though this feature is not yet available.
* While enabling secret scanning on the Security & Analysis page the dialog incorrectly mentions private repositories.
* When editing a wiki page a user could experience a 500 error when clicking the Save button.
* An S/MIME signed commit using a certificate with multiple names in the subject alternative name would incorrectly show as "Unverified" in the commit badge.
* User saw 500 error when executing git operations on an instance configured with LDAP authentication.
* Suspended user was sent emails when added to a team.
* When a repository had a large number of manifests an error `You have reached the maximum number of allowed manifest files (20) for this repository.` was shown on the Insights -> Dependency graph tab. For more information, see [Visualization limits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/troubleshooting-the-detection-of-vulnerable-dependencies#are-there-limits-which-affect-the-dependency-graph-data).
* Fixes users being shown the option to set up the Code Scanning CodeQL Action even if Actions was not enabled for their repository.
* The "Prevent repository admins from changing anonymous Git read access" checkbox available in the enterprise account settings could not be successfully enabled or disabled.
* The modal used to display a mandatory message contained no vertical scrollbar, meaning longer messages could not be viewed in full.
* Redis would sometimes fail to start after a hard reboot or application crash.
* Dependency graph fails to parse `setup.py` Python manifest files, resulting in HTTP 500 errors in logs. This, combined with the duplicated logging issue, results in increased root volume utilization.

### Changes

* Satisfy requests concurrently when multiple users are downloading the same archive, resulting in improved performance.

### Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* When maintenance mode is enabled, some services continue to be listed as "active processes". The services identified are expected to run during maintenance mode. If you experience this issue and are unsure, contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* Duplicated logging to `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`, and `/var/log/user.log` results in increased root volume utilization.
* Users can dismiss a mandatory message without checking all checkboxes.
* [Pre-receive hook scripts](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/policies/enforcing-policy-with-pre-receive-hooks) cannot write temporary files, which may cause script execution to fail. Users who use pre-receive hooks should test in a staging environment to see if scripts require write access.
* Repository [deploy keys](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys) are unable to be used with repositories containing LFS objects.
* Jupyter Notebook rendering in the web UI may fail if the notebook includes non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.
* reStructuredText (RST) rendering in the web UI may fail and instead display raw RST markup text.
* Dependency graph fails to parse `yarn.lock` Javascript manifest files, resulting in HTTP 500 errors in logs.
* Instances with a custom timezone that were upgraded from an earlier release of GitHub Enterprise Server may have incorrect timestamps in the web UI.
* Old builds of Pages are not cleaned up, which could fill up the user disk (`/data/user/`).
* When deleting a branch after merging a pull request, an error message appears although the branch deletion succeeds.
* Users may experience assets such as avatars not loading, or a failure to push/pull code. This may be caused by a PID mismatch in the `haproxy-cluster-proxy` service. To determine if you have an affected instance:

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.0.25) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

The minimum infrastructure requirements have increased for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0+. For more information, see "[About minimum requirements for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 and later](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server#about-minimum-requirements-for-github-enterprise-server-30-and-later)."

### Security fixes

* **HIGH:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration of the underlying parsers used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to execute commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-10519 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).

### Features

#### [GitHub Actions](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#github-actions)

* [Secret Scanning beta](https://github.com/features/security) scans public and private repositories for committed credentials, finds secrets, and notifies the secret provider or admin the moment they are committed into a repository.

  Administrators using GitHub Advanced Security can [enable and configure](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/configuration/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-appliance) GitHub Advanced Security secret scanning. You can review the [updated minimum requirements for your platform](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance) before you turn on GitHub Advanced Security secret scanning.
#### [Advanced Security Code Scanning](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#advanced-security-code-scanning)

* [GitHub Advanced Security code scanning](https://github.com/features/security) is now generally available on GitHub Enterprise Server. Organizations who have purchased Advanced Security can use this capability to do static analysis security testing against their code, and prevent vulnerabilities from making it to their production code using CodeQL, our semantic analysis engine. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning on your appliance](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/configuration/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#running-code-scanning-using-github-actions)"

### Changes

#### [Administration Changes](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#administration-changes)

* The webhook events delivery system has been rearchitected for higher throughput, faster deliveries, and fewer delayed messages. It also uses less CPU and memory in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0+.
* Organization and Enterprise owners can now see when a team member has been promoted to or demoted from being a team maintainer in the audit log through the new `team.promote_maintainer` and `team.demote_maintainer` audit log events. For more information, see "[Audited actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/user-management/audited-actions)."
* Repository maintainers with existing GitHub Pages sites can [easily update their prior default branch name](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites).
* Additional hardware resources are required to run GitHub Enterprise Server with any of Actions, Packages or Advanced Security enabled. For more information on the minimum required resources for each supported platform, see "[Setting up a GitHub Enterprise Server instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."
* Administrators can now [publish a message](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/user-management/customizing-user-messages-for-your-enterprise), which all users must accept. This can help to onboard new users and surface other organization-specific information and policies.
#### [Security Changes](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#security-changes)

* Organization owners can now disable publication of GitHub Pages sites from repositories in the organization. Disabling GitHub Pages for the organization will prevent members from creating new Pages sites but will not unpublish existing sites. For more information, see "[Disabling publication of GitHub Pages sites for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/disabling-publication-of-github-pages-sites-for-your-organization)."
* A datacenter must be explicitly defined on all nodes before enabling an active replica.
* All usage of SSH fingerprints has been switched to use SHA256 fingerprints as they are used with OpenSSH since version 6.8 as well. This applies to the web interface and also the API where fingerprints are returned such as in GraphQL. The fingerprints follow the OpenSSH format.
* SHA-1 and SHA-256 signature headers (two headers) are sent on webhooks.
#### [Developer Changes](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#developer-changes)

* Majority of the services running in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0+ are now on containers which internally enables GitHub to iterate fast and ship high quality releases
* The webhook events delivery system has been rearchitected for higher throughput, faster deliveries, and fewer delayed messages.
#### [API Changes](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#api-changes)

* Administrators can now configure and manage the site-wide announcement banner via the REST API. For more information, see the endpoints for "[GitHub Enterprise administration](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/rest/reference/enterprise-admin#annoucements)."
* A new API endpoint enables the exchange of a user to server token for a user to server token scoped to specific repositories. For more information, see "[Apps](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/rest/reference/apps#create-a-scoped-access-token)" in the GitHub REST API documentation.
#### [Default branch renaming](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#default-branch-renaming)

* Enterprise and organization administrators can now set the default branch name for new repositories. Enterprise administrators can also enforce their choice of default branch name across all organizations or allow individual organizations to choose their own.

  Existing repositories are unaffected by these settings, and their default branch name will not be changed.

  The default branch for newly-created repositories will be set to `main` in GHES 3.1, unless you opt out by setting the default branch setting at the enterprise level.

  This change is one of many changes GitHub is making to support projects and maintainers that want to rename their default branch. To learn more about the changes we're making, see [github/renaming](https://github.com/github/renaming).

* All known issues from Release Candidate 1 and Release Candidate 2 have been fixed, except those listed in the Known Issues section below.
#### [Fixes for other issues](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#fixes-for-other-issues)

* Issues with migrations and upgrades to 3.0.0 have been fixed.
* Backup Utilities versioning now works for release candidate versions.
* Generating a support bundle resulted in an error in the orchestrator logs.
* A large restore could result in Redis running out of memory.
* The checkbox to enable GitHub Actions in the Management Console is now visible with any authentication method.
* GitHub Actions could be enabled if the required storage was also configured.
* `ghe-repl-status` could silently fail if MSSQL replication was not configured.
* The format of several log files have changed, including the addition of a PID for different log types. This does not affect how GitHub Enterprise Support uses support bundles to troubleshoot issues.
* A PATCH request to the webhook configuration API no longer erases the webhook secret.
* Certain types of pre-receive hooks were failing.
* The Packages NuGet service now normalizes semantic versions on publish. An invalid semantic version (for example: v1.0.0.0.0.0) is not downloadable by NuGet clients and therefore a NuGet service is expected to normalize those versions (for example: v1.0.0.0.0.0 --> v1.0.0). Any original, non-normalized, version will be available in the `verbatimVersion` field. No changes to client configurations are required.

### Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.blog/2016-02-18-upload-files-to-your-repositories/) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* When maintenance mode is enabled, some services continue to be listed as "active processes". The services identified are expected to run during maintenance mode. If you experience this issue and are unsure, contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=docs-generic).
* When GitHub Actions is enabled, use '`ghe-maintenance -u`' to unset maintenance mode.
* Duplicated logging to `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`, and `/var/log/user.log` results in increased root volume utilization.
* Users can dismiss a mandatory message without checking all checkboxes.
* [Pre-receive hook scripts](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/policies/enforcing-policy-with-pre-receive-hooks) cannot write temporary files, which may cause script execution to fail. Users who use pre-receive hooks should test in a staging environment to see if scripts require write access.
* Repository [deploy keys](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys) are unable to be used with repositories containing LFS objects.
* Jupyter Notebook rendering in the web UI may fail if the notebook includes non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.
* reStructuredText (RST) rendering in the web UI may fail and instead display raw RST markup text.
* Dependency graph fails to parse `setup.py` Python manifest files, resulting in HTTP 500 errors in logs. This, combined with the duplicated logging issue, results in increased root volume utilization.
* A race condition can cause dependency graph database migrations to appear to fail.
* Instances with a custom timezone that were upgraded from an earlier release of GitHub Enterprise Server may have incorrect timestamps in the web UI.
* Old builds of Pages are not cleaned up, which could fill up the user disk (`/data/user/`).
* When deleting a branch after merging a pull request, an error message appears although the branch deletion succeeds.
* When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, GitHub Enterprise Server may still route GitHub Pages requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of GitHub Pages for users.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

### Deprecations

#### [Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 2.19](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-github-enterprise-server-219)

* **GitHub Enterprise Server 2.19 is deprecated as of November 12, 2020**. That means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/upgrading-github-enterprise/) as soon as possible.
#### [Deprecation of Legacy GitHub App Webhook Events](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-legacy-github-app-webhook-events)

* Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 2.21.0 two legacy GitHub Apps-related webhook events have been deprecated and will be removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.2.0. The deprecated events `integration_installation` and `integration_installation_repositories` have equivalent events which will be supported. More information is available in the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-15-replacing-the-installation-and-installation-repositories-events/).
#### [Deprecation of Legacy GitHub Apps Endpoint](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-legacy-github-apps-endpoint)

* Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 2.21.0 the legacy GitHub Apps endpoint for creating installation access tokens was deprecated and will be removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.2.0. More information is available in the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-15-replacing-create-installation-access-token-endpoint/).
#### [Deprecation of OAuth Application API](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-oauth-application-api)

* GitHub no longer supports the OAuth application endpoints that contain `access_token` as a path parameter. We have introduced new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by moving `access_token` to the request body. While deprecated, the endpoints are still accessible in this version. We intend to remove these endpoints on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. For more information, see the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).
#### [Deprecation of support for Semiotic](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-support-for-semiotic)

* The service supported a "Find by Symbol" experience in the pull request view that was not widely used.
#### [Deprecation of workflow commands](/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-workflow-commands)

* GitHub Actions `set-env` and `add-path` workflow commands have been deprecated. For more information, see the [changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-github-actions-deprecating-set-env-and-add-path-commands/).

### Backups

* GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.0.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/configuration/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).
