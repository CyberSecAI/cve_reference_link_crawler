## Enterprise Server 2.21.23

[Download](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/2.21.23/download)Print

June, 10, 2021

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.1/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Security fixes

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
Bug fixes

* Import failures of organizations or repositories from non-GitHub sources could produce an `undefined method '[]' for nil:NilClass` error.
Changes

* Users of the GraphQL API can query the public field `closingIssuesReferences` on the `PullRequest` object. This field retrieves issues that will be automatically closed when the related pull request is merged. This approach will also allow this data to be migrated in future, as part of a higher fidelity migration process.
Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Security alerts are not reported when pushing to a repository on the command line.
* When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, GitHub Enterprise Server may still route GitHub Pages requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of GitHub Pages for users.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#2.21.23) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.1/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Security fixes

* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed access tokens generated from a GitHub App's [web authentication flow](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#web-application-flow) to read private repository metadata via the REST API without having been granted the appropriate permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. The private repository metadata returned would be limited to repositories owned by the user the token identifies. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.4 and was fixed in versions 3.0.4, 2.22.10, 2.21.18. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22865 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
Bug fixes

Downloads have been disabled due to a major bug affecting multiple customers. A fix will be available in the next patch.

Security fixes

* **HIGH:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to override environment variables leading to code execution on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.3 and was fixed in 3.0.3, 2.22.9, and 2.21.17. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22864.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
Bug fixes

* The `ghe-cluster-config-init` run was not fully accounting for the exit code of background jobs leading to improper handling of preflight checks.
Changes

* Logs will rotate based on size in addition to time.
* Use a relative number for consul and nomad `bootstrap_expect` allowing for a cluster to bootstrap even if a handful of nodes are down.
Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Security alerts are not reported when pushing to a repository on the command line.
* Log rotation may fail to signal services to transition to new log files, leading to older log files continuing to be used, and eventual root disk space exhaustion.
  To remedy and/or prevent this issue, run the following commands in the [administrative shell](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/configuration/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh) (SSH), or contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us) for assistance:

  ```
  printf "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/share/enterprise:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n29,59 * * * * root /usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf\n" | sudo sponge /etc/cron.d/logrotate
  sudo /usr/sbin/logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

Security fixes

* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed authenticated users of the instance to gain write access to unauthorized repositories via specifically crafted pull requests and REST API requests. An attacker would need to be able to fork the targeted repository, a setting that is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories. Branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22861. This issue was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in the GitHub Enterprise Server GraphQL API that allowed authenticated users of the instance to modify the maintainer collaboration permission of a pull request without proper authorization. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker would be able to gain access to head branches of pull requests opened on repositories of which they are a maintainer. Forking is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories and would prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22863. This issue was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **HIGH:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration of the underlying parsers used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to execute commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-10519 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** GitHub Tokens from GitHub Pages builds could end up in logs.
* **LOW:** A specially crafted request to the SVN bridge could trigger a long wait before failure resulting in Denial of Service (DoS).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
Bug fixes

* The load-balancer health checks in some cases could cause the babeld logs to fill up with errors about the PROXY protocol.
* An informational message was unintentionally logged as an error during GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities snapshots, which resulted in unnecessary emails being sent when backups were scheduled by cron jobs that listen for output to stderr.
* While restoring a large backup, exception logging related to Redis memory exhaustion could cause the restore to fail due to a full disk.
* When editing a wiki page a user could experience a 500 error when clicking the Save button.
* An S/MIME signed commit using a certificate with multiple names in the subject alternative name would incorrectly show as "Unverified" in the commit badge.
* Suspended user was sent emails when added to a team.
* When a repository had a large number of manifests an error `You have reached the maximum number of allowed manifest files (20) for this repository.` was shown on the Insights -> Dependency graph tab. For more information, see [Visualization limits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/troubleshooting-the-detection-of-vulnerable-dependencies#are-there-limits-which-affect-the-dependency-graph-data).
* When uploading a new license file with a different number of seats from the previous license file, the seat difference was not correctly represented in the enterprise account Settings -> License page.
* The "Prevent repository admins from changing anonymous Git read access" checkbox available in the enterprise account settings could not be successfully enabled or disabled.
* When a GitHub Pages build failed, the email notification contained an incorrect link for support location.
* During a leap year, the user was getting a 404 response when trying to view Contribution activity on a Monday.
* Visiting the *Explore* section failed with a 500 Internal Server error.
Changes

* Added support for [AWS EC2 r5b instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-new-amazon-ec2-r5b-instances-featuring-60-gbps-of-ebs-bandwidth-and-260K-iops/).

Security fixes

* **CRITICAL:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Pages that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration of the underlying parsers used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to execute commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server. The underlying issues contributing to this vulnerability were identified both internally and through the GitHub Security Bug Bounty program. We have issued CVE-2020-10518.
* **MEDIUM:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified that allowed authenticated users of the instance to determine the names of unauthorized private repositories given their numerical IDs. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content besides the name. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 2.22 and has been assigned [CVE-2020-10517](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10517). The vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
Bug fixes

* A message was not logged when the ghe-config-apply process had finished running ghe-es-auto-expand.
* Excessive logging to the `syslog` file could occur on high-availability replicas if the primary appliance is unavailable.
* Database re-seeding on a replica could fail with an error: `Got packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet'`
* In some cases duplicate user data could cause a 500 error while running the ghe-license-usage script.
* Using `ghe-migrator`, the `add` command would fail to lock a repository when using the `--lock` flag.
Changes

* In a high availability or geo-replication configuration, replica instances would exit maintenance mode when ghe-config-apply ran.
* We've added support for the R5a and R5n AWS instance types.
* Removed the license seat count information on the administrative SSH MOTD due to a performance issue impacting GitHub Enterprise Server clusters.
Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Security alerts are not reported when pushing to a repository on the command line.
* Audit logs may be attributed to 127.0.0.1 instead of the actual source IP address. (updated 2020-11-02)

Security fixes

* **CRITICAL:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Pages that could allow an attacker to execute commands as part building a GitHub Pages site. This issue was due to an outdated and vulnerable dependency used in the Pages build process. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server. To mitigate this vulnerability, Kramdown has been updated to address CVE-2020-14001.
* **HIGH:** High: An attacker could inject a malicious argument into a Git sub-command when executed on GitHub Enterprise Server. This could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files with partially user-controlled content and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to access repositories within the GHES instance. However, due to other protections in place, we could not identify a way to actively exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability was reported through the GitHub Security Bug Bounty program.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
Bug fixes

* A Consul configuration error prevented some background jobs from being processed on standalone instances.
* The service memory allocation calculation could allocate an incorrect or unbounded memory allocation to a service resulting in poor system performance.
* The virtualization platform for oVirt KVM systems was not properly detected, causing problems during upgrades.
