## Enterprise Server 2.22.22

[Download](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/2.22.22/download)

September, 24, 2021

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.2/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Security fixes

* **HIGH:** A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to read files on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.1.8 and was fixed in 3.1.8, 3.0.16, and 2.22.22. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-22867. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22868.
Bug fixes

* The GitHub Connect configuration of the source instance was always restored to new instances even when the `--config` option for `ghe-restore` was not used. This would lead to a conflict with the GitHub Connect connection and license synchronization if both the source and destination instances were online at the same time.
* Fixes GitHub Pages builds so they take into account the NO\_PROXY setting of the appliance. This is relevant to appliances configured with an HTTP proxy only.
Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, GitHub Enterprise Server may still route GitHub Pages requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of GitHub Pages for users.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#2.22.22) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.2/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Security fixes

* **HIGH:** A UI misrepresentation vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed more permissions to be granted during a GitHub App's user-authorization web flow than was displayed to the user during approval. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization, but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.x prior to 3.0.7 and 2.22.x prior to 2.22.13. It was fixed in versions 3.0.7 and 2.22.13. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22866 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.

Security fixes

* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed access tokens generated from a GitHub App's [web authentication flow](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#web-application-flow) to read private repository metadata via the REST API without having been granted the appropriate permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. The private repository metadata returned would be limited to repositories owned by the user the token identifies. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.4 and was fixed in versions 3.0.4, 2.22.10, 2.21.18. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22865 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).

* Log rotation may fail to signal services to transition to new log files, leading to older log files continuing to be used, and eventual root disk space exhaustion.
  To remedy and/or prevent this issue, run the following commands in the [administrative shell](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/configuration/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh) (SSH), or contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us) for assistance:

  ```
  printf "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/share/enterprise:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n29,59 * * * * root /usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf\n" | sudo sponge /etc/cron.d/logrotate
  sudo /usr/sbin/logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

  ```
* When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, GitHub Enterprise Server may still route GitHub Pages requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of GitHub Pages for users.

## Enterprise Server 2.22.7

[Download](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/2.22.7/download)

March, 02, 2021

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#2.22.22) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.2/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Security fixes

* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed authenticated users of the instance to gain write access to unauthorized repositories via specifically crafted pull requests and REST API requests. An attacker would need to be able to fork the targeted repository, a setting that is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories. Branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22861. This issue was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in the GitHub Enterprise Server GraphQL API that allowed authenticated users of the instance to modify the maintainer collaboration permission of a pull request without proper authorization. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker would be able to gain access to head branches of pull requests opened on repositories of which they are a maintainer. Forking is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories and would prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22863. This issue was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **HIGH:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration of the underlying parsers used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to execute commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-10519 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** GitHub Tokens from GitHub Pages builds could end up in logs.
* **LOW:** A specially crafted request to the SVN bridge could trigger a long wait before failure resulting in Denial of Service (DoS).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
Bug fixes

* The load-balancer health checks in some cases could cause the babeld logs to fill up with errors about the PROXY protocol.
* An informational message was unintentionally logged as an error during GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities snapshots, which resulted in unnecessary emails being sent when backups were scheduled by cron jobs that listen for output to stderr.
* While restoring a large backup, exception logging related to Redis memory exhaustion could cause the restore to fail due to a full disk.
* When first setting up a new instance, if you selected "Configure as Replica" you would be unable to start replication.
* When GitHub Actions was enabled, disabling maintenance mode in the management console failed.
* When editing a wiki page a user could experience a 500 error when clicking the Save button.
* An S/MIME signed commit using a certificate with multiple names in the subject alternative name would incorrectly show as "Unverified" in the commit badge.
* Suspended user was sent emails when added to a team.
* User saw 500 error when executing git operations on an instance configured with LDAP authentication.
* The `remove_org_member_package_access` background job was visible in the management console and would continually increase.
* When a repository had a large number of manifests an error `You have reached the maximum number of allowed manifest files (20) for this repository.` was shown on the Insights -> Dependency graph tab. For more information, see [Visualization limits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/troubleshooting-the-detection-of-vulnerable-dependencies#are-there-limits-which-affect-the-dependency-graph-data).
* When uploading a new license file with a different number of seats from the previous license file, the seat difference was not correctly represented in the enterprise account Settings -> License page.
* The "Prevent repository admins from changing anonymous Git read access" checkbox available in the enterprise account settings could not be successfully enabled or disabled.
* When a GitHub Pages build failed, the email notification contained an incorrect link for support location.
* During a leap year, the user was getting a 404 response when trying to view Contribution activity on a Monday.
Changes

* Added support for [AWS EC2 r5b instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-new-amazon-ec2-r5b-instances-featuring-60-gbps-of-ebs-bandwidth-and-260K-iops/).
* Adjusted background queue prioritization to more evenly distribute jobs.
Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.

#### [Suspend and Unsuspend an App Installation](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#suspend-and-unsuspend-an-app-installation)

* Administrators and users can [suspend any GitHub App’s access](https://docs.github.com/enterprise/2.22/user/rest/reference/apps#suspend-an-app-installation) for as long as needed, and [unsuspend the app](https://docs.github.com/enterprise/2.22/user/rest/reference/apps#unsuspend-an-app-installation) on command through Settings and the API. Suspended apps cannot access the GitHub API or webhook events. You can use this instead of uninstalling an application, which deauthorises every user. ''
#### [Improved Large Scale Performance](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#improved-large-scale-performance)

* We have revised the approach we take to scheduling network maintenance for repositories, ensuring large monorepos are able to avoid failure states. ''

  Passive replicas are now [supported and configurable on GitHub Enterprise Server cluster deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability-replication-for-a-cluster). These changes will enable faster failover, reducing RTO and RPO.
#### [View All of Your Users](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#view-all-of-your-users)

* For exceptionally large teams, administrators can [adjust the 1,500 default maximum for user lists](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/configuration/command-line-utilities#ghe-config). ''
Changes

#### [Administration Changes](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#administration-changes)

* Shared workers have been enabled to make live updates more resilient by sharing connections across tabs.
* The "Contact Support" link on `50x` error pages now links to the support email or link configured in the Management Console.
* It's now possible to [manage global announcements and expiration dates through the enterprise account settings](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/installation/command-line-utilities#ghe-announce).
* You can now [exempt certain users from the default API rate limits configured in the management console](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/configuration/configuring-rate-limits), if necessary.
* Repository administrators can now [set their repository to any available visibility option](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility) from a single dialog in the repository's settings. Previously, you had to navigate separate sections, buttons, and dialog boxes for changing between public and private and between private and internal.
* A new Enterprise settings link on the user dropdown menu makes it easier to navigate to Enterprise Account Settings.
* The legacy "Admin Center" link on the /stafftools page has been removed. The "Enterprise" link is now the best way to navigate to the Enterprise Account from the /stafftools page.
* The Options sub-menu item in the Enterprise Account settings has been moved from the Settings section to the Policies section.
* [Accessing resources by using a personal access token or SSH key now counts as user activity](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/user-management/managing-dormant-users). This relieves administrators from the burden of filtering out certain users from the user dormancy reports and makes it safer to use the "Suspend all" button without accidentally suspending users who only accessed GitHub in a read-only way over the APIs with a Personal Access Token (PAT) or SSH key.
#### [Security Changes](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#security-changes)

* Two-factor recovery codes can no longer be used during the two-factor sign in process. One-Time-Passwords are the only acceptable values.
* When a user is signed into GitHub Enterprise Server through single sign-on, the [default repository visibility selection is Private](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility).
* Owners of GitHub Apps can now choose to have their [user-to-server access tokens expire after 8 hours](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-30-expiring-user-to-server-access-tokens-for-github-apps/), to help enforce regular token rotation and reduce the impact of a compromised token.
#### [Developer Changes](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#developer-changes)

* [The GitHub UI has undergone a design refresh](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-06-23-design-updates-to-repositories-and-github-ui/), and the repositories homepage has been redesigned, including a responsive layout and improved mobile web experience.
* In the "Clone with SSH" repository dropdown menu, users will now be notified if they do not have any keys setup.
* Commits are now ordered chronologically in the pull request timeline and commits tab. This new ordering is also reflected in the ["List commits on a pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/rest/reference/pulls#list-commits-on-a-pull-request) REST API and GraphQL ["PullRequest object"](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/graphql/reference/objects#pullrequest) timeline connection.
* Users can now [set a skin tone default for emoji autocomplete results](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-17-customizable-skin-tones-in-emoji-autocomplete/) in comment text areas.
* [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) improves syntax highlighting and is now the default library used for language parsing.
#### [Users and organizations can add Twitter usernames to their GitHub profiles](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#users-and-organizations-can-add-twitter-usernames-to-their-github-profiles)

* [Developers and organizations can now add their Twitter username to their profile](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-22-users-and-organizations-can-now-add-twitter-usernames-to-their-github-profiles/)
#### [API Changes](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#api-changes)

* #### Graduated Previews

  The following previews are now an official part of the API:

  + The GitHub Apps API and endpoints that returned the `performed_via_github_app` property no longer require the [`machine-man`](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-08-20-graduate-machine-man-and-sailor-v-previews/) preview header.
  + To add and view a lock reason to an issue, you no longer need to use the [`sailor-v`](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-08-20-graduate-machine-man-and-sailor-v-previews/) preview header.
* #### GraphQL Schema Changes

  + [The GraphQL schema changes](https://docs.github.com/enterprise/2.22/user/graphql/overview/changelog) include backwards-compatible changes, schema previews, and upcoming breaking changes.
#### [VMware Network Driver Changes](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#vmware-network-driver-changes)

* The GitHub Enterprise Server default network adapter type for VMware customers has been changed from E1000 to VMXNET3, starting with release 2.22.0. When upgrading from an earlier release to 2.22.0 or newer, if an E1000 network adapter is detected during the pre-upgrade check, the following message will be displayed at the command line:

  ```
  WARNING: Your virtual appliance is currently using an emulated Intel E1000 network adapter.
  For optimal performance, please update the virtual machine configuration on your VMware host to use the VMXNET3 driver.
  Proceed with installation? [y/N]

  ```

  The administrator can choose to update the network adapter type to VMXNET3 either before or after the GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade. The virtual appliance will need to be shutdown for this change. Customers should follow the VMware recommended steps for [changing the virtual machine network adapter configuration](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-3719A0BE-4B4A-44FF-8A21-290950918FBD.html) to VMXNET3. Please note that `VMXNET3` will not be an option if the OS version for the virtual appliance is set to `Other Linux (64-bit)`. In that case, the OS version would first need to be changed from `Other Linux (64-bit)` to `Other 2.6.x Linux (64-bit)` or if available, `Debian GNU/Linux 9` . We recommend testing these changes on a [staging instance](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/installation/setting-up-a-staging-instance) before it is performed on a production GitHub Enterprise Server.
Bug fixes

* The stafftools page for viewing pending collaborator showed a `500 Internal Server Error` when there was a pending email invite.
* The Repository Health Check in stafftools could give incorrect results on busy repositories.
* A logged in user trying to accept an email invitation could get a `404 Not Found` error.
* If a user navigated to a repository whose name started with "repositories.", they were redirected to the owner's "Repositories" tab instead of landing on the repository overview page.
* Labels in the dashboard timeline did not have enough contrast.
Deprecations

#### [Upcoming Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 2.19](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#upcoming-deprecation-of-github-enterprise-server-219)

* **GitHub Enterprise Server 2.19 will be deprecated as of November 12, 2020** That means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/upgrading-github-enterprise/) as soon as possible.
#### [Deprecation of Legacy GitHub App Webhook Events](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-legacy-github-app-webhook-events)

* Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 2.21.0 two legacy GitHub Apps-related webhook events have been deprecated and will be removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 2.25.0. The deprecated events `integration_installation` and `integration_installation_repositories` have equivalent events which will be supported. More information is available in the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-15-replacing-the-installation-and-installation-repositories-events/).
#### [Deprecation of Legacy GitHub Apps Endpoint](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-legacy-github-apps-endpoint)

* Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 2.21.0 the legacy GitHub Apps endpoint for creating installation access tokens was deprecated and will be removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 2.25.0. More information is available in the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-15-replacing-create-installation-access-token-endpoint/).
#### [Deprecation of OAuth Application API](/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-oauth-application-api)

* GitHub no longer supports the OAuth application endpoints that contain `access_token` as a path parameter. We have introduced new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by moving `access_token` to the request body. While deprecated, the endpoints are still accessible in this version. We intend to remove these endpoints on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. For more information, see the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).
Backups

* GitHub Enterprise Server 2.22 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) 2.22.0 for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.22/admin/guides/installation/backups-and-disaster-recovery/).
Known issues

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The Name ID Format dropdown in the Management Console resets to "unspecified" after setting instance to "persistent".
* The repository Settings page of a repository for a user or organization GitHub Pages sites will fail with a "500 Internal Server Error".
* Users may experience slower Git clone and fetch performance on an instance with high availability replicas due to reads being forwarded to a different node.
* [Creating a GitHub App from a manifest](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app-from-a-manifest) fails. To work around this issue, users can follow the manual instructions for [creating a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app).
* GitHub usernames may change unintentionally when using SAML authentication, if the GitHub username does not match the value of the attribute mapped to the `username` field in the Management Console. (updated 2020-10-08)
* On a freshly set up 2.22.0 instance or after upgrading to 2.22.0, the activity feed on an organization's dashboard will no longer update. (updated 2020-10-27)
* Audit logs may be attributed to 127.0.0.1 instead of the actual source IP address. (updated 2020-11-02)
* When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, GitHub Enterprise Server may still route GitHub Pages requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of GitHub Pages for users.
