### Description

The FileBird – WordPress Media Library Folders & File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the folder name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access or higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
