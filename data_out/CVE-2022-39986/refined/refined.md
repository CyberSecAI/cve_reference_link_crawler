Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-39986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `cfg_id` POST parameter in the `/ajax/openvpn/activate_ovpncfg.php` and `/ajax/openvpn/del_ovpncfg.php` files of the RaspAP web-gui application.
- The application directly uses the unsanitized `cfg_id` parameter in a shell command, specifically within `system()` and `exec()` calls, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw, where an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `cfg_id` parameter before using it in shell commands.
- **Unauthenticated Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint does not require authentication or a valid CSRF token, making it easily exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the server hosting the RaspAP application. This could allow complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious `cfg_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the server hosting the vulnerable RaspAP application to send HTTP requests. No authentication is required.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Understanding of how to craft a POST request with a form parameter is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates sending a malicious command within the `cfg_id` parameter to achieve root level command execution on the target system.
- The vulnerable code snippet from `/ajax/openvpn/del_ovpncfg.php` confirms the unsanitized use of the `cfg_id` parameter within the `exec("sudo rm $ovpncfg_files", $return)` call, where `$ovpncfg_files` is constructed using the attacker controlled input.
- The vulnerability is present in RaspAP web-gui versions 2.8.0 through 2.8.7.
- The fix for this vulnerability, involved wrapping the parameter with PHP's `escapeshellarg()` function.
