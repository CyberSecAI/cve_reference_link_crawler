Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect default permissions in the software installer for Intel® MAS (GUI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper setting of default permissions during the installation of Intel® MAS (GUI). This allows an attacker to leverage these incorrect permissions to achieve a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required.
*   An authenticated user is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   User interaction is required, though this is not explicitly stated if it means the user has to interact with the attacker or an interface in the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where Intel® MAS (GUI) is installed.
*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Summary of Vulnerability**

The vulnerability is due to incorrect default permissions during the installation of Intel's Memory and Storage Tool GUI. This allows a local attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack. The fix is to update to version 2.5.0 of the software or later.
