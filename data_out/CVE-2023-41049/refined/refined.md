Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-41049

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `init` function in the `@dcl/single-sign-on-client` package did not properly validate the input URL, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code by using a `javascript:` prefix.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation, specifically lack of sanitization or validation of the URL passed to the `init` function.
- Code injection vulnerability allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary javascript code. This could lead to various malicious activities like stealing user data, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- The provided description indicates a high confidentiality impact since data access by an unauthorized user may be achieved.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network, where the attacker can provide a malicious URL to the vulnerable function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control or influence the input URL that is passed to the `init` function. No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version `0.1.0` of the package.
- Workarounds involve sanitizing user inputs or not passing any user-controlled input to the init function.
- The CVSS score is 7.5, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
- The related CWE is CWE-83 (Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes).
- The patch commit introduces a URL validation using the `validator` library, ensuring that the provided URL is a valid https URL, preventing the injection of javascript code via the `javascript:` prefix.
