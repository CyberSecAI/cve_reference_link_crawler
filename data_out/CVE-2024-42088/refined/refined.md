The provided content describes a fix for a bug in the Linux kernel's ASoC (Audio System on Chip) subsystem related to the MediaTek mt8195 audio driver. This issue is related to the audio routing configuration for the ETDM1_OUT_BE dai link, and not a vulnerability.

Root cause of the issue:
- A previous commit (e70b8dd26711) incorrectly removed the codec entry for the ETDM1\_OUT\_BE dai link.
- Instead of replacing the codec entry with a COMP_EMPTY(), the commit removed it entirely.
- This caused the platform entry to become empty, which is effectively the same as COMP_DUMMY().
- The platform entry array doesn't get populated, and the code at sound/soc/mediatek/common/mtk-soundcard-driver.c expects it to have at least one entry and it results in an out-of-bounds access when dereferencing dai_link->platforms.

Weaknesses:
- The code relies on the dai_link->platforms array to have at least one entry, but the previous change didn't ensure that.
- The code does not check if dai_link->platforms is allocated before accessing it, resulting in a potential out of bounds access.

Impact of exploitation:
- The issue causes a KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) out-of-bounds warning, which indicates a memory safety issue.
- This issue could potentially lead to a crash or undefined behavior of the audio subsystem.

Attack vectors:
- This isn't a vulnerability that can be exploited to gain privilege or cause a denial of service. The vulnerability can be triggered if the relevant audio components for the mt8195 are initialized, triggering the out-of-bounds access.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the audio drivers on the system using the mt8195 audio chipset. This is not a remote attack vector; it requires access to the device.

The fix introduces a COMP\_EMPTY() entry to ensure the dai\_link->platforms has space, preventing the out-of-bounds access in mtk_soundcard_common_probe().
