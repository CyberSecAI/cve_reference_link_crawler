| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2218195#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-06-28 12:16:22 UTC  ``` A race condition vulnerability was found in the vmwgfx driver in the Linux kernel. Quoting ZDI security advisory [1]:  "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of GEM objects. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of the kernel."
