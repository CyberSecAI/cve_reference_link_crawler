# NO Security checking for UnsafeAccess.getInstance()

Moderate

[Karlatemp](/Karlatemp)
published
GHSA-cr6p-23cf-w9g9
Jul 11, 2022

## Package

maven

io.github.karlatemp:unsafe-accessor
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>1.4.0

## Patched versions

1.7.0

## Description

### Overview

Affected versions have no limit to using unsafe-accessor. Can be ignored if `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` not setup

### Details

If UA was loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA will be protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard api.

Main application can setup `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit accesses to UA.

Untrusted code can access UA without lmitation in affected versions even UA was loaded as a named module.
