Enable app pinning and disable "Ask for PIN before unpinning" setting 2. Pin an app (ie: Settings) 3. Lockdown from the power menu 4. Observe: user is brought to the keyguard, primary auth is required to enter the device. => After entering correct credential, the device is still in app pinning mode. => After entering an incorrect credential, the keyguard remains showing and the user can attempt again up to the limitBug: 300463732Bug: 218495634Test: atest KeyguardViewMediatorTestTest: manual(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:d9c7c85c52c007fdedb177b9f5f98821d0a76090)Merged-In: I70fdae80f717712b3dfc9df54b9649959b4bb8f0Change-Id: I70fdae80f717712b3dfc9df54b9649959b4bb8f0
