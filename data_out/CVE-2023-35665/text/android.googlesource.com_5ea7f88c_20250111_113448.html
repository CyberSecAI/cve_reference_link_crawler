Commit Message:
--------------
Fixed leak of cross user data in multiple settings. - Any app is allowed to receive GET\_CONTENT intent. Using this, an user puts back in the intent an uri with data of another user. - Telephony service has INTERACT\_ACROSS\_USER permission. Using this, it reads and shows the deta to the evil user.Fix: When telephony service gets the intent result, it checks if the uri is from the current user or not.Bug: b/256591023 , b/256819787Test: The malicious behaviour was not being reproduced. Unable to import contact from other users data.Test2: Able to import contact from the primary user or uri with no user id(These settings are not available for secondary users)(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:ab593467e900d4a6d25a34024a06195ae863f6dc)Merged-In: I1e3a643f17948153aecc1d0df9ffd9619ad678c1Change-Id: I1e3a643f17948153aecc1d0df9ffd9619ad678c1
