There is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Policy
management UI of Absolute Secure Access prior to version 13.06. Attackers with
system administrator permissions can interfere with another system
administratorâ€™s use of the policy management UI when the administrators are
editing the same policy object. The scope is unchanged, there is no loss of
confidentiality. Impact to system availability is none, impact to system
integrity is high.
