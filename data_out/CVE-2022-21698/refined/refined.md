    "affected_configuration": "In order to be affected, an instrumented software must\n\n* Use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`.\n* Do not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware.\n* Pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware.\n* Not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`.",

      "Remove `method` label name from counter/gauge you use in the InstrumentHandler.",

       "Add custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request.",
