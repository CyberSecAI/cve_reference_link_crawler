[Dependabot alerts

## Package

gomod

github.com/prometheus/client\_golang
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.11.1

## Patched versions

1.11.1

## Description

This is the Go client library for Prometheus. It has two separate parts, one for instrumenting application code, and one for creating clients that talk to the Prometheus HTTP API. client\_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client\_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients.

### Impact

HTTP server susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods.

### Affected Configuration

In order to be affected, an instrumented software must

* Use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`.
* Do not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware.
* Pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware.
* Not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`.

### Patches

* [prometheus/client\_golang#962](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/962)
* [prometheus/client\_golang#987](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/987)

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade to [v1.11.1 or above](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/releases/tag/v1.11.1), in order to stop being affected you can:

* Remove `method` label name from counter/gauge you use in the InstrumentHandler.
* Turn off affected promhttp handlers.
* Add custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request.
* Use a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.

### For more information

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
