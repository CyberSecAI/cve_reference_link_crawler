# InstrumentHandler\* HTTP middleware prone to DoS through method label cardinality

Moderate

[bwplotka](/bwplotka)
published
GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p
Feb 15, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/prometheus/client\_golang/prometheus/promhttp
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.11.1

## Patched versions

1.11.1

## Description

### Impact

HTTP server susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods.

### Affected Configuration

In order to be affected, an instrumented software must

* Use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`.
* Do not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware.
* Pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware.
* Not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`.

### Patches

* [#962](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/962)
* [#987](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/987)

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade to [v1.11.1 or above](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/releases/tag/v1.11.1), in order to stop being affected you can:

* Remove `method` label name from counter/gauge you use in the InstrumentHandler.
* Turn off affected promhttp handlers.
* Add custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request.
* Use a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.

### For more information
