The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26445.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability present in the `/core/tools/delete_place.php` component of flusity-CMS v2.33.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection in the delete_place.php component. This allows an attacker to forge requests that can be executed by an authenticated victim.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick an authenticated user into deleting places within the CMS, which could lead to data loss or disruption of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can craft a malicious HTML page with a form that automatically submits a request to `/core/tools/delete_place.php` with the intention of deleting a specific place, which would be triggered when the authenticated user visits it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage that the victim will visit while being authenticated to flusity-CMS. The attacker does not require any specific privileges within the application. The attacker also needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and its parameters.
