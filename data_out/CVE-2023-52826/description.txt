In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panel/panel-tpo-tpg110: fix a possible null pointer dereference

In tpg110_get_modes(), the return value of drm_mode_duplicate() is
assigned to mode, which will lead to a NULL pointer dereference on
failure of drm_mode_duplicate(). Add a check to avoid npd.
