Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The commit message "htdocs/admin/save\_roles.php: fixed SQL injection, yet again" indicates a SQL injection vulnerability was present in the `save_roles.php` file.
- The code diff shows that the `$_GET['id']` parameter was being directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization. Specifically, the vulnerable line `mysql_query("DELETE FROM webfinance_roles WHERE id_role=".$_GET['id']);` was present before the fix.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL, an attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially delete arbitrary data, modify database contents, gain unauthorized access, or perform other malicious operations. In this specific case, the vulnerable code allowed deletion of roles in the `webfinance_roles` table.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the URL of the `save_roles.php` script. For example, by sending a URL like `save_roles.php?action=delete&id=1 OR 1=1` an attacker could cause a SQL injection to occur.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable script with the ability to manipulate the URL query parameters.
- They likely need some basic knowledge of SQL to craft a successful injection.
- The attacker might need to be authenticated to access the script or at least have a basic understanding of the application structure.

**Additional notes:**
- The commit message indicates that this wasn't the first time a SQL injection was found in this file.
- The provided diff shows the fix applied: `$_GET['id'] = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['id']);` which escapes the user-supplied input prior to being included in the SQL statement.
- The code uses the deprecated `mysql_*` functions, which are known to be unsafe. This highlights other security issues within the code base.
