# Introduction[ï](#introduction "Permalink to this heading")

This page contains a list of all *RTIÂ® ConnextÂ®* vulnerabilities that have
been published through the
[CVEÂ® Program](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview).

Note

Since this document only contains vulnerabilities published through the
[CVEÂ® Program](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview), the vulnerabilities
listed in this document are a subset of the
vulnerabilities published in the RTI Security Notices.

To receive further updates on vulnerabilities found in RTI products, including
those that are not disclosed through the public CVE, please subscribe to our
security notification list by sending an email to security@rti.com.

If you believe you have found a vulnerability affecting RTI products, please
report it to us by sending an email to security@rti.com.

# RTIâs Approach to Vulnerability Detection and Management[ï](#rti-s-approach-to-vulnerability-detection-and-management "Permalink to this heading")

RTI considers vulnerabilities regardless of the source. We define a
vulnerability as a product bug that affects the integrity or confidentiality
of the system using our products, and can be triggered externally to the
application. We follow industry practices, such as CVSS score, to assess the
severity of vulnerabilities. Our software bill of materials (SBOM)
(located in the *Connext* installation directory) details
the third-party software included in RTIâs products. Starting in
*Connext* 7.3.0, we provide the SBOM in [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)
and [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) formats. When a vulnerability is reported in
third-party software, RTI assesses its impact on RTIâs products.

RTI applies best practices to detect vulnerabilities, including a secure coding
standard, the use of static and dynamic analysis tools, fuzz testing, and
long-running endurance tests.

RTI releases security patches for active LTS releases
(see [Connext Releases](https://www.rti.com/products/connext-releases)). We
proactively create
patches for most commonly used architectures in LTS releases. Customers can
request patches for other architectures by contacting RTI Support
(see the [RTI Customer Portal](https://support.rti.com)). We include fixes
to critical vulnerabilities in third-party software once a patch is available
by the provider that is compatible with the version used in RTIâs software.

RTI software distribution through the
[RTI Customer Portal](https://support.rti.com) includes a SHA-256 hash.
Releases starting in 2024 are signed.

RTI communicates the availability of new security patches and shares sufficient
details (such as CVSS score/vector and mitigation options) about the fixes to
enable RTI customers to do their own risk analysis. To join or be removed from
the RTI Security Notification list, please send a request with your
contact and company/program information to security@rti.com.

## CVE-2024-52062[ï](#cve-2024-52062 "Permalink to this heading")

### [Critical] Potential stack buffer write overflow in Connext applications while parsing malicious XML types document[ï](#critical-potential-stack-buffer-write-overflow-in-connext-applications-while-parsing-malicious-xml-types-document "Permalink to this heading")

An out-of-bounds write on the stack could have occurred while parsing a
malicious XML types document.

User Impact without Security

A vulnerability in the Core Libraries affected all products that load
types via XML, and could have resulted in the following:

* Stack buffer overflow while parsing a malicious XML types document.
* Exploitable by changing an XML configuration file on the file system.
* Potential impact on the integrity of the application(s) using the XML
  types document. Such applications could include *Routing Service*.
* Potential crash in the application.
* In the case of *Routing Service*, the vulnerability could potentially
  have been triggered through the remote administration command load,
  but a successful attack would have required a malicious XML include
  file to already exist in the system, so the âAttack Vectorâ score is
  still âLocalâ.

## CVE-2024-52059[ï](#cve-2024-52059 "Permalink to this heading")

### [Critical] Potential heap buffer overflow in Security Plugins while creating a DomainParticipant that uses a malformed Identity Certificate[ï](#critical-potential-heap-buffer-overflow-in-security-plugins-while-creating-a-domainparticipant-that-uses-a-malformed-identity-certificate "Permalink to this heading")

The *Security Plugins* were affected by a heap buffer overflow
vulnerability that occurred while creating a *DomainParticipant* that
used a malformed Identity Certificate.

User Impact without Security

NONE

User Impact with Security

The impact on *Security Plugins* applications of using the previous
version was as follows:

* Exploitable by overwriting the Identity Certificate on the file
  system with a malicious Identity Certificate that does not even need
  to be properly signed by the Identity CA.
* The application could have experienced a heap buffer overwrite during
  creation of a new *DomainParticipant* that attempted to use the
  malicious Identity Certificate, impacting the integrity and
  availability of the application.
* This problem was much easier to exploit on a 32-bit architecture. On
  a 64-bit architecture, this problem affected only the Security
  Plugins for OpenSSL, not wolfSSL.
* The problem was only exploitable if the
  `authentication.propagate_simplified_identity_certificate` property
  was unset or set to `TRUE`.

Mitigations

Any one of the following steps is sufficient to mitigate the problem:

* Protect access to the file system from which *Connext* applications
  are loading certificates.
* Use the `data:,` prefix to specify the
  `dds.sec.auth.identity_certificate` property value.
* Set the `authentication.propagate_simplified_identity_certificate`
  property to `FALSE`.
* If available for your platform, use wolfSSL instead of OpenSSL. This
  mitigation only works if your architecture is 64-bit.
