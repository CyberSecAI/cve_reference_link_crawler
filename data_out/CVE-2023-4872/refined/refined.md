The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the SourceCodester Contact Manager App. While it lists CVE-2023-4872 as one of the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities, it does not provide specific details for CVE-2023-4872 that would differentiate it from the other SQL injection vulnerability, CVE-2023-4871, which is also mentioned in the content.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection (CVE-2023-4871, CVE-2023-4872):** User-supplied input is directly embedded into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `contact` parameter in `delete.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to data deletion, modification, or retrieval of sensitive information. In this case, a crafted SQL injection payload caused the deletion of all contacts.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting a malicious payload in the `contact` parameter of the `delete.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication required.
