- Lack of input sanitization and validation.
- Direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering and modification.
- Potential for complete system control.
- Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the "Email" parameter in a POST request to `register.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be an unauthenticated user
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests with a malicious SQL payload through the Email parameter in the registration form.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the 'Online Bus Reservation Site Using PHP With Source Code' version 1.0.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using time-based blind, boolean-based blind, and error-based SQL injection techniques.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) includes example payloads and SQLmap command for demonstrating the vulnerability.
- Suggested repairs include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
