Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control in the BIOS firmware for some Intel NUCs before version INWHL357.0046.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the BIOS firmware handles access control, allowing a privileged user to bypass intended restrictions.
- The issue is related to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition, allowing for memory corruption via DMA timing attacks (as described in the CERT advisory, though not explicitly in the Intel advisory for this CVE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege: An attacker with local access and already having some level of privilege can further escalate their privileges by exploiting the vulnerability.
- Denial of service:  While not the main impact, denial of service is also listed as a potential consequence.
- The CERT advisory details more severe impacts possible via this class of vulnerabilities, including invalidating UEFI security features, installing persistent software, creating backdoors, and potentially causing permanent system shutdown.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attack is executed through DMA timing attacks exploiting TOCTOU conditions within SMI Handlers and how they validate SMRAM, as detailed in the CERT advisory on RingHopper attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the local machine.
-  As per the CERT document, an attacker with local or remote administrative privileges can exploit DMA timing attacks
- The attacker needs to be able to perform DMA timing attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Intel advisory specifically mentions "privileged user" as the required access, implying an attacker with administrator-level privileges.
- The CERT advisory provides the wider context of a set of related vulnerabilities dubbed "RingHopper" attacks, affecting multiple vendors and UEFI implementations, including this vulnerability in Intel NUCs. This context includes the more specific vector of DMA timing attacks and the manipulation of SMRAM.
- The affected Intel products are specifically identified as "IntelÂ® NUC Mini PC NUC8i7INH and NUC8i5INH."
- Intel recommends updating the BIOS firmware to the specified version (or later) to mitigate the vulnerability.

In summary, this vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the BIOS firmware, allowing a privileged user to potentially elevate their privileges using local access. The CERT document gives more detail on the TOCTOU attack vector and describes how attackers are able to achieve privilege escalation through exploitation of vulnerabilities in SMI Handlers in conjunction with DMA attacks.
