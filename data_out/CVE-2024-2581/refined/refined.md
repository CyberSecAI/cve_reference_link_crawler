- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSetRouteStatic` function due to the usage of `sscanf` with greedy matching. The user-controlled `list` parameter from a POST request is passed to `sscanf` function without proper size checks. The `%[^,]` format specifier reads characters until a comma is encountered which causes a buffer overflow if the input exceeds the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow
    - Insecure use of `sscanf` with greedy matching
    - Lack of input validation and size checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Crash of the device/service due to the stack overflow
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a POST request to the `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint.
    - The `list` parameter of the POST request contains the malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint of the Tenda AC10 router.
    -  The attacker does not need any privileged access or be authenticated.
