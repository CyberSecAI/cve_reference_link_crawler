- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Splunk Enterprise fails to properly validate and escape the Host header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Host header injection, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) and cache poisoning.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote authenticated user can inject scripts or manipulate server-side behavior. This could potentially lead to cross-site scripting and cache poisoning.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote authenticated user can send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious Host header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a remote user and have valid authentication credentials to Splunk Enterprise. The attack complexity is high.
