Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Stored Self-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1985

**Affected Plugin:** Simple Membership WordPress plugin

**Affected Versions:** <= 4.4.2

**Root Cause:**
The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in the 'Display Name' parameter when updating a member profile. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weakness:**
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Lack of output escaping

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a user's profile.
- When the victim logs in and accesses their profile page the injected scripts would execute in their browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via the 'Display Name' parameter when updating a member profile.
- The attacker would have to use social engineering to convince a victim to update their profile with a malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to update a member's profile with a malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

- This is considered a "self-based" XSS because the injected code only executes when the victim user accesses the affected profile page, not other users.

- The impact is limited because the attacker requires a user to log in to execute the malicious code, reducing the scope of the impact.

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.4.3 by implementing output escaping on the profile update forms.
