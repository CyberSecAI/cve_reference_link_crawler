Before I decided to try your product, I tried Norton, Avast, McAfee, Kaspersky, and I do not remember a couple others more which. I tried them on a badly infected computer. At the last I gave Twister a try and found another 12 Trojans/virus left over after all the other programs finished scanning and repairing the computer. That was enough for me to buy 3 twisters. - John PapazoglouShare   \* 1 year for 1 PC license: With this service, you receive the right to use this product on one PC during the service period, which begins upon initial installation.

## Description

Twister Antivirus v8.17 is vulnerable to
a Denial of Service vulnerability by triggering the `0x80112067`,
`0x801120CB 0x801120CC 0x80112044, 0x8011204B, 0x8011204F,`
`0x80112057, 0x8011205B, 0x8011205F, 0x80112063, 0x8011206F,`
`0x80112073, 0x80112077, 0x80112078, 0x8011207C` and `0x80112080`
IOCTL codes of the `fildds.sys` driver.

## Vulnerability

The `0x80112067, 0x801120CB 0x801120CC 0x80112044, 0x8011204B, 0x8011204F,`
`0x80112057, 0x8011205B, 0x8011205F, 0x80112063, 0x8011206F,`
`0x80112073, 0x80112077, 0x80112078, 0x8011207C` and `0x80112080`
IOCTL code of the `fildds.sys` driver allows to perform a
Denial of Service, leading to a BSOD of the affected computer caused
by a NULL pointer dereference.

The resulting debugging session when triggering
those IOCTLs resemble the following:
