| I took a quick look at the issues, but I didn't find a similar one. Also, I hope that this is the right repository to report this.  Opening this HTML file executes code on the client:  ``` <html> <script> alert("Hey, `id`!"); </script> </html> ```  In the console this produces the following output which is fine:  ``` ALERT: Hey, `id`!  ```  But the popup shows that `id` is indeed being run:  [grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5578100/72219536-6b74fa80-3547-11ea-97e7-d644ac24f361.png)  I reported this issue over at [jdm/tinyfiledialogs-rs#19](https://github.com/jdm/tinyfiledialogs-rs/issues/19) half a year ago but I'm not sure it is going to be fixed there.  I downloaded the nightly build from servo.org today and ran it under Ubuntu 18.04 amd64. |

| If we want a technically standard-compliant quick fix here, we're allowed to arbitrarily truncate the string at any arbitrary point according to <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/timers-and-user-prompts.html#optionally-truncate-a-simple-dialog-string>, so we could truncate it before the first unsafe character. |

| I'm now working on a mitigation to try to plug the known hole quickly and I'll have a PR for it tonight. There may be other hazards in tinyfiledialogs that we don't know about, as it has many different codepaths depending on which potentially dialog-displaying executables it can find on the user's system. |

| I'd like to mention two possible ways forward from this:  **1** I really like how direct and straightforward <https://github.com/saurvs/nfd-rs> is compared to tinyfiledialogs. Unfortunately, part of that directness is that nfd-rs has *just* file dialogs, not simpler things like alert boxes and input boxes which we currently also use from tinyfiledialogs.  I think it might make sense for someone with access to Windows/Linux/Mac buildchains, as a slightly ambitious but pretty reasonable project, to fork nfd-rs and its C upstream, clean up any dependency conflicts it might have with Servo, and add those simpler cases to it.  **2** Another possibility would be to build our own dialogs within the glutin or winit ecosystem. We're already making buttons and input boxes as part of HTML layout, so there should be no technical reason why we can't make dialogs (assuming getting a popup window isn't much harder than I imagine). That would maximize look-and-feel consistency and minimize the number of places in the code we're calling out to the native graphics library. |

| Hi, I am the author of tinyfiledialogs. I've just corrected this security issue in version 3.8.0. tinyfiledialogs now detects the single and double quotes in titles, messages and various parameters. The dialogs are still displayed but the faulty parameters are replaced with a warning. Let me now if I can help. thanks. |
