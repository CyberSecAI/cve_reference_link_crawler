# Header normalization allows for client to clobber proxy set headers

Moderate

[nateberkopec](/nateberkopec)
published
GHSA-9hf4-67fc-4vf4
Sep 19, 2024

## Package

bundler

puma
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 6.4.3

## Patched versions

>= 6.4.3, >= 5.6.9

## Description

### Impact

Clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded\_For). Any users trusting headers set by their proxy may be affected. Attackers may be able to downgrade connections to HTTP (non-SSL) or redirect responses, which could cause confidentiality leaks if combined with a separate MITM attack.

### Patches

v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win.

### Workarounds

Nginx has a [underscores\_in\_headers](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#underscores_in_headers) configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level.

Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers for security or availability should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the fixed versions.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
