{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `mdiobus_free()` function was called from `devm_mdiobus_free()` during the device shutdown sequence when the mdiobus was not previously unregistered, leading to a kernel panic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect use of devres for mdiobus allocation and registration.",
      "The `mdiobus_free()` function is called after the mdiobus is unregistered when using devres, leading to a panic."
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel panic during device shutdown or system reboot.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the device shutdown process, specifically when a DSA master is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown (like dpaa2-eth). The device link between the switch and the DSA master triggers `device_links_unbind_consumers()` which unbinds the Marvell switch driver on shutdown, and leads to a call to `devm_mdiobus_free()`.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to trigger a system shutdown or reboot, and have a configuration where the DSA master is on a bus that calls `->remove` during shutdown (e.g., using `dpaa2-eth` on the `fsl-mc` bus)."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves removing the use of `devres` for mdiobus allocation and registration in the Marvell driver. Instead, `mdiobus_alloc_size()` is used for allocation, and `mdiobus_free()` is called directly during unregistration.",
     "The corrected code uses `mdiobus_alloc_size` instead of `devm_mdiobus_alloc_size`, and uses `mdiobus_free` directly for cleanup."
