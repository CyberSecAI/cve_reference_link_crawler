- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The specific vulnerability is due to missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could potentially execute actions that should be reserved for higher-privileged users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector would be through functions that lack proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with contributor privileges or less.
