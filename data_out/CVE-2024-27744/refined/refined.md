```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application allows users to upload an SVG file as a profile image, and it does not properly sanitize or validate the content of the uploaded SVG file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within the SVG file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view the attacker's profile page. This could lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive data, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- Attack vectors: An attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code to the "Image" field in the profile.php page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have an account and be logged into the application to be able to upload the malicious SVG file. The attacker needs to have the ability to access the vulnerable application page (http://localhost/fuelflow/admin/profile.php) and upload the SVG file.
