Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35929:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper escaping of content displayed in the "card fields" of the agile dashboard, specifically within the kanban and PV2 apps. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS (CWE-79). User-supplied data, displayed as card fields, is not properly sanitized, allowing arbitrary HTML and JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user, who can create or edit tracker artifacts, can inject malicious scripts in card fields
- This would lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser when they view the kanban or PV2 apps.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "card fields" within the agile dashboard apps (kanban and PV2).
- An attacker needs to have the ability to create an artifact or to edit a field used as a card field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account with the privilege to create or edit artifacts/fields that are used as card fields.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the application is not properly escaping/sanitizing the displayed content in the "card fields".
- The fix involves the use of the `hybrids` template engine and `dompurify` to properly escape the displayed content and prevent XSS.
- The commit message for the fix (0b2945fbd260d37aa0aff2ca1c867d160f76188d) mentions that the template engine of `hybrids` is "bit abused", which might suggest a complex or indirect way of sanitizing the data.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Tuleap Community Edition 14.10.99.4 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.10-2 and 14.9-5.
- The CVSS v3 score is 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Moderate" severity.
