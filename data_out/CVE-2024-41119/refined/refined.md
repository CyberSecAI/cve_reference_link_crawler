Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41119:

**CVE-2024-41119:** Remote code execution in `pages/8_🏜️_Raster_Data_Visualization.py`

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses the `eval()` function on user-provided input (`vis_params`) within the `pages/8_🏜️_Raster_Data_Visualization.py` file without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized user input is directly passed to the `eval()` function, allowing arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server hosting the streamlit-geospatial application, allowing them to potentially take full control of the system.
*   **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a malicious string through the `Enter visualization parameters` text area, which is then evaluated using the `eval()` function.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `pages/8_🏜️_Raster_Data_Visualization.py` page and input a malicious string into the `Enter visualization parameters` text area.

The provided information includes the following additional details:

*   **Vulnerable code:** The `vis_params` variable on [line 80](https://github.com/opengeos/streamlit-geospatial/blob/4b89495f3bdd481998aadf1fc74b10de0f71c237/pages/8_%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8F_Raster_Data_Visualization.py#L80) in `8_🏜️_Raster_Data_Visualization.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on [line 86](https://github.com/opengeos/streamlit-geospatial/blob/4b89495f3bdd481998aadf1fc74b10de0f71c237/pages/8_%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8F_Raster_Data_Visualization.py#L86), leading to remote code execution.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
    1. Start streamlit-geospatial.
    2. Go to the 🏜️ Raster Data Visualization tab and select `Add visualization parameters`.
    3. Paste the following into `Enter visualization parameters`:
    ```
    __import__('code').InteractiveInterpreter().runsource('import os;os.system(\"echo $(uname -a) > foobar.txt\")')
    ```
    4.  Observe that a file `foobar.txt` has been created on the server, which contains the output of the `uname -a` command.
*   **Fix:** The fix for this vulnerability involves replacing the usage of `eval()` with `json.loads()` after replacing single quotes with double quotes in the user input: `vis_params = json.loads(vis_params.replace("'", '"'))`.
*   **Mitigation:** A whitelist of trusted URLs is implemented in the fix, and users can only input data that is a dictionary
