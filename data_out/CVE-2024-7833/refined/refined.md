- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `upgrade_filter.asp` file in D-Link DI-8100 firmware version 16.07 is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `cmd` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected D-Link DI-8100 router.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the `upgrade_filter.asp` file, and the attack vector is through the `cmd` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable `upgrade_filter.asp` file, exploiting the unsanitized `cmd` parameter.
