  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of numeric query IDs in certain API endpoints, which could potentially expose metadata across authenticated Looker users who share the same LookML model.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Metadata exposure vulnerability due to predictable query IDs",
      "Lack of proper access control on certain API endpoints"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of metadata to unauthorized users sharing the same LookML model. The specific metadata that could be exposed is not detailed.",
      "attack_vectors": "By using the affected API endpoints with numeric query IDs, a malicious user could potentially gain access to metadata they should not be able to see. The attacker needs to be an authenticated user who shares the same LookML model.",
    "required_capabilities": "Authenticated Looker user sharing the same LookML model as the victim."
  },
  "additional_details": "The document provides detailed instructions on how to update affected API scripts, find the 'slug' value for queries, and enable the patch. It also outlines the timeline for mandatory enforcement of the patch for Looker-hosted instances and provides system activity instructions for customers to find whether they are using affected endpoints."
