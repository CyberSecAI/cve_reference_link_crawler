- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-125, out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leak.
- **Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` indicates:
    -   **AV:L (Local):** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.
    -   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    -  **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required.
    -   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required for the attack to be successful.
    -  **S:U (Unchanged):** The security scope is unchanged.
    -   **C:H (High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality, specifically a memory leak.
    -   **I:N (None):** There is no impact on integrity.
    -   **A:N (None):** There is no impact on availability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system, user interaction is required and no privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
