{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Harbor fails to validate maintainer role permissions when creating/updating/deleting project configurations through the metadata API.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient authorization checks on the metadata API endpoints, allowing users with the 'maintainer' role to modify project configurations they should not have access to.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with the 'maintainer' role can modify configurations in a project they do not have explicit access to by exploiting the metadata API, potentially leading to unauthorized changes and compromising the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted request to the metadata API endpoints (PUT, POST, DELETE) with a metadata name that belongs to a project the attacker doesn't have permissions for.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated Harbor user with the 'maintainer' role for a specific project. The attacker uses the metadata API to modify project configurations they should not be able to modify."
