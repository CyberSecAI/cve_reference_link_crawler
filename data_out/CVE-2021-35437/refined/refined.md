The content provided details a SQL injection vulnerability in lmxcms version 1.4.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user input in the `name` parameter when processing SQL queries. The `tagaction` class preprocesses the SQL statement using the `p` function. While it attempts to filter out HTML tags and perform URL decoding, this filtering is bypassed through the insertion of HTML tags (e.g., `se<>lect`) and URL encoding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input before using it in SQL queries. It tries to use blacklist approach to filter, which is not robust.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the backend database. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through the `name` parameter in the URL when accessing the `tags` module with the `index` action (`/lmxcms/index.php?m=tags&a=index`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific authentication is mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability is likely exploitable remotely without prior access.
