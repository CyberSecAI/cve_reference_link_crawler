This vulnerability is due to improper handling of specific fields in a DHCPv6 RELAY-REPLY message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv6 packet to any IPv6 address that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the dhcp\_snoop process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-dhcp6-relay-dos-znEAA6xn>  This advisory is part of the August 2024 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: August 2024 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75417).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 3000 and 7000 Series Switches and Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode if all the following conditions are true:    + They are running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 8.2(11), 9.3(9), or 10.2(1).   + They have the DHCPv6 relay agent enabled.   + They have at least one IPv6 address configured on the device. For additional information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine the Status of the DHCPv6 Relay Agent**  The DHCPv6 relay agent is disabled by default in Cisco NX-OS Software because the overall DHCP feature is disabled by default. However, if the DHCP feature has been enabled, the DHCPv6 relay agent is automatically enabled, even if no DHCPv6 server address is configured on the device.  If the DHCP feature is enabled, the DHCPv6 relay agent may be manually disabled using the **no ipv6 dhcp relay** configuration command at the device CLI.  To determine if the DHCPv6 relay agent is enabled, use the **show run all | include "^ipv6 dhcp relay"** command at the device CLI. If the command returns output, the DHCPv6 relay agent is enabled, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show run all | include "^ipv6 dhcp relay"ipv6 dhcp relay   ```  To determine if at least one IPv6 address is configured on the device, use the **show ipv6 interface brief** command at the device CLI, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show ipv6 interface briefIPv6 Interface Status for VRF "default"(1)Interface        IPv6 Address/Link-local Address           Interface Status                                                            prot/link/adminEth1/50          2001:db8::1                               up/up/up                 fe80::a678:6ff:fed1:3e45   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode   + Secure Firewall 3100 Series   + Secure Firewall 4200 Series   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  For devices that have the DHCP feature enabled, there may be a mitigation for this vulnerability. If the DHCPv6 relay agent functionality is not required, use the **no ipv6 dhcp relay** configuration command at the device CLI to disable the DHCPv6 relay agent.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-only this advisory, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or all advisories.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode.   5. Click **Check**.
