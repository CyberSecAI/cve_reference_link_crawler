- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of specific fields in a DHCPv6 RELAY-REPLY message.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is related to a NULL pointer dereference in the DHCPv6 relay agent due to a crafted DHCPv6 packet. The vulnerability is identified as CWE-476, which is a NULL Pointer Dereference
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to the `dhcp_snoop` process crashing and restarting multiple times, which eventually causes the affected device to reload, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv6 packet to any IPv6 address configured on an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to an affected device's configured IPv6 address. The attacker does not need any prior authentication or specific privileges.
