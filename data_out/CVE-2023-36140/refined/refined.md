Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of stored passwords within the PHP Jabbers scripts. Specifically, passwords are not hashed or encrypted properly but instead stored in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Password Storage:** Passwords for users are stored in plain text in the database, making them easily readable by anyone with access to the database or admin panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker gaining access to the admin panel or database could easily obtain all user passwords.
*   **Account Compromise:** Attackers with access to the passwords can impersonate any user.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** User data, especially sensitive account details, are exposed.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Stolen credentials can be used for further malicious actions such as phishing attacks, identity theft, or unauthorized access to other services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Admin Account:** An attacker gaining access to the admin panel can view user details, including cleartext passwords.
*   **Database Access:** Direct access to the database would allow an attacker to view all user passwords stored in clear text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel with valid admin credentials or direct access to the database where the user information is stored.

**Additional Information:**

*   The specific scripts affected are not listed in this document, but it does confirm that at least two of PHP Jabbers scripts are affected by this vulnerability.
*   The vendor was notified through online forms but remained unresponsive to the vulnerability reports.
*   The described vulnerability allows an admin user to view any user password in plain text through the "Users" section, by simply clicking the edit pencil.
