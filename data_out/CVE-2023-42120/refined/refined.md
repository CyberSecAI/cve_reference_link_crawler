Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input before using it in a system call within the `dns_zone_editor` module of Control Web Panel. This allows for command injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with root privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability. It is network-based and requires authentication to the Control Web Panel.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need network access to the Control Web Panel and a valid user account to authenticate.
