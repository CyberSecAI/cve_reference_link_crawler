### @tgmichel **[tgmichel](/tgmichel)** commented [Sep 3, 2021](#issue-987798971)

This PR fixes an issue where invalid transactions are stored on pallet-ethereum storage for free.

### Description

* User `A` sends transaction with input data which's cost is greater than the gas limit.
* The EVM will early exit if that transaction cost cannot be paid, and the account `nonce` is not increased in that case.
* Currently the `pallet_evm::runner` does not *Error* in that case, so pallet-ethereum inserts the transaction metadata in it's storage. At this point, once the block is sealed, that transaction is mapped to the block, even if it didn't increase the `nonce` for user `A`, thus bloating the runtime storage for free (as the used gas still 0 and the fees are refunded in the runner after).

Transactions that cannot pay for the transaction cost itself should be discarded, its source account nonce not increased and not stored in the ethereum block (and they shouldn't be included in the substrate block neither). They cannot occupy blockchain space.

Sorry, something went wrong.
