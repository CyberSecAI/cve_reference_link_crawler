### @tgmichel **[tgmichel](/tgmichel)** commented [Sep 3, 2021](#issue-987798971)

This PR fixes an issue where invalid transactions are stored on pallet-ethereum storage for free.

### Description

* User `A` sends transaction with input data which's cost is greater than the gas limit.
* The EVM will early exit if that transaction cost cannot be paid, and the account `nonce` is not increased in that case.
* Currently the `pallet_evm::runner` does not *Error* in that case, so pallet-ethereum inserts the transaction metadata in it's storage. At this point, once the block is sealed, that transaction is mapped to the block, even if it didn't increase the `nonce` for user `A`, thus bloating the runtime storage for free (as the used gas still 0 and the fees are refunded in the runner after).

Transactions that cannot pay for the transaction cost itself should be discarded, its source account nonce not increased and not stored in the ethereum block (and they shouldn't be included in the substrate block neither). They cannot occupy blockchain space.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Transaction validity oversight in pallet-ethereum

Low

[sorpaas](/sorpaas)
published
GHSA-hw4v-5x4h-c3xm
Sep 1, 2021

## Package

cargo

Frontier
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= commit 4b6c808

## Patched versions

>= commit 0b962f2

## Description

### Impact

A bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints.

### Patches

Patches are applied in PR [#465](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/pull/465).

### Workarounds

None.

### References

Patch PR: [#465](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/pull/465)

### For more information

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-39193
