Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Eramba web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the "path" parameter of the `/settings/download-test-pdf` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are then executed by the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-94):** The application is vulnerable to command injection due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the "path" parameter. The application directly uses the unsanitized input within a system call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server where the application is hosted. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data exfiltration, and further attacks on the internal network.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain control over the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of system configurations, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/settings/download-test-pdf` endpoint. The attacker injects malicious commands into the "path" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the Eramba web application. This means the attack is performed by a low-privileged, authenticated user of the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Eramba application server.
*   **Debug Mode (for output):** To see the output of the executed command in the HTTP response, debug mode has to be enabled. However, the command will still execute without debug mode enabled, the attacker just wont see the output.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Trovent Security GmbH.
*   The vulnerable versions are Eramba 3.19.1 (Enterprise and Community edition).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.19.2.
