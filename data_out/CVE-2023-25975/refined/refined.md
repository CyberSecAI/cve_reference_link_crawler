- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Etsy Shop plugin, versions 3.0.3 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions on their behalf. This could include modifying plugin settings, injecting malicious code, or other actions depending on the plugin's functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website or email that contains a crafted request targeting the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form while they are logged into the WordPress site with the vulnerable plugin active. This requires the attacker to understand how the plugin's functions are invoked. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim needs to have an active session.
