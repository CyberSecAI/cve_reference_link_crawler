- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simple Post plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Text" input field within the plugin settings, and it does not escape these values when outputting them to the browser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will then execute in the browsers of other users who access the plugin settings. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, stealing cookies, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with the ability to access and modify the plugin's settings page can inject the malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least the capability to access and edit the plugin's settings.
