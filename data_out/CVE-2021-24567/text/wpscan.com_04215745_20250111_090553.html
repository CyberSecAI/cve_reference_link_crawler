## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Post <= 1.1 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize user input when an authenticated user Text value, then it does not escape these values when outputting to the browser leading to an Authenticated Stored XSS Cross-Site Scripting issue.

### Proof of Concept

1. Install WordPress 5.7.2
2. Install and activate Simple Post
3. Navigate to Settings >> Simple Post and enter the XSS payload into the Text input field.
4. Click Update Options.
5. You will observe that the payload successfully got stored into the database and when you are triggering the same functionality at that time JavaScript payload is executing successfully and we are getting a pop-up.
6. Payload Used: "><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
