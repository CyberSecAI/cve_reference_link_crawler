{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `chkAttr_file_val` function in `CValidation.php` does not adequately sanitize user-supplied file paths, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection due to insufficient input sanitization of file paths",
     "Insufficient path validation allows accessing forbidden directories by using \"..\""
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary commands by exploiting the file path validation weakness, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious commands within a file path that is processed by the `chkAttr_file_val` function when the `_type` is set to `file1`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the file path input that's validated by the `CValidation` class."
