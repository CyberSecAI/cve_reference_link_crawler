Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-27491:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper verification of the source of a communication channel within FortiOS. This allows an attacker to manipulate TCP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper verification of source of communication channel [CWE-940].
- The vulnerability exists when the firewall policy is in flow-based inspection mode (default) AND a Security Profile (Web Filter, AntiVirus, IPS, DLP, Application Control, SSL, File filter) is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger the sending of "blocked page" HTML data to an arbitrary victim.
- This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the potential flooding of the victim with unsolicited data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by sending crafted TCP requests.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send crafted TCP requests to a FortiOS device.
- The attacker doesn't require any authentication or special privileges

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is referred to as a "TCP Middlebox Reflection" vulnerability.
- The amplification of the attack can be reduced by emptying the replacement page in Security Profile settings.
- The attack is possible due to the combination of flow-based inspection and active security profile features that can trigger a "blocked page" response.
- The vulnerability can also be mitigated by switching to proxy-based inspection mode instead of flow-based.
- Upgrading the IPS engine can also mitigate this issue.
