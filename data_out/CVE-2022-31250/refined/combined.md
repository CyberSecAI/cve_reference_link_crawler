This means that this information is not public.  Please do NOT: - talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - make this bug public - submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap/Tumbleweed) until this bug becomes   public. This means that the security team removed the EMBARGOED tag from   the bug title after we verified that there's already information about   this bug publicly available. If you find such information yourself and   the bug is still embargoed please contact us  Your primary responsibility is to apply a fix for this issue. Here is some guidance on openSUSE package maintenance: - [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package_maintenance](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3APackage_maintenance) - [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Maintenance_update_process](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3AMaintenance_update_process)  You need to submit AFTER the bug became public, to the current openSUSE Leap codestreams, and to the devel project of your package.  The security team will then take the following steps: - We wait for your submission and package them into an incident for QA   testing. The QA tester might reach out to you if they find issues with   the update. - If QA doesn't find any issues, we publish the updates.

Those calls are there because now the different services was executed as root, creating some directories as root in the process. Now we implemented a user downgrade mechanism, so the different services are running under a non privilege user (keylime). The %post code was put there to change the user to this keylime one, so the new agents can still write on it after the upgrade.  Is there a way that I can still change the owner of those files and directories in a way that do not produce any security issue? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1200885#c4)  Alberto Planas Dominguez   2022-06-23 16:13:56 UTC  ``` Guianluca Grabrielli pinged me that I make the mistake of releasing the fix. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1200885#c5)  Alberto Planas Dominguez   2022-06-23 16:15:01 UTC  ``` Remove EMBARGOED tag after talking with Johannes Segitz. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1200885#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-07-04 08:12:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to aplanas@suse.com from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1200885#c3)) > Is there a way that I can still change the owner of those files and > directories in a way that do not produce any security issue?  It is pretty difficult in shell code. If is just one level below a user controlled directory then `chown -h` suffices. If it is deeper below a user controlled directory then you can use sequences like (in bash):      cd -P /some/user/controlled/dir     if [ "$PWD" != "/some/user/controlled/dir" ]; then 	echo "followed symlink" 	exit 1     else 	chown -h someuser somefile     fi ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1200885#c8)  Alberto Planas Dominguez   2022-07-14 08:46:36 UTC  ``` Thanks all for the help. As the SR showed I removed the code from TW, but to fix an issue in SLE I reintroduced a version of it:  For files I am doing this:  chown -h keylime:tss /filename/path 2> /dev/null || :  I checked that this is indeed doing the correct thing: change the ownership of the link itself, but not the linked file.  For directories I am doing this:  chown -h -R keylime:tss /directory/path 2> /dev/null || :  I checked this adding file links inside the directory, links to directories inside the directory and converting the directory in a link itself. In all the three tests I saw that it is doing the right thing: change the ownership of the link itself, and never of the linked element. For linked directories I also checked that is not walking it neither.  The code is [https://build.suse.de/package/view_file/home:aplanas:branches:SUSE:SLE-15-SP4:Update/keylime/keylime.spec?expand=1](https://build.suse.de/package/view_file/home%3Aaplanas%3Abranches%3ASUSE%3ASLE-15-SP4%3AUpdate/keylime/keylime.spec?expand=1), and if there are no complains I will do a MU soon.  I hope that this does not re-introduce a variant of this CVE. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1200885#c12)  Swamp Workflow Management   2022-08-03 22:20:45 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2022:2658-1: An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.
