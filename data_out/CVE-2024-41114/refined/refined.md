The provided content contains vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-41114.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses the `eval()` function on user-controlled input to process the `palette` variable when using the `MODIS Gap filled Land Surface Temperature Daily` option within the `pages/1_ðŸ“·_Timelapse.py` module. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe use of `eval()`: The application directly evaluates user-supplied strings as code, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running the streamlit-geospatial application.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-supplied input: The `palette` variable is populated through a text area in the application's web interface, making it directly controlled by the user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the application's web interface and the ability to input text into the designated input field. No special privileges are required beyond using the application as intended.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `pages/1_ðŸ“·_Timelapse.py` on line 435:
```python
st.session_state["palette"] = eval(palette)
```
- The attack involves entering malicious Python code into the `Enter a custom palette:` text area.
- An example payload provided is:
  ```python
  __import__('code').InteractiveInterpreter().runsource('import os;os.system(\"echo $(uname -a) > foobar.txt\")')
  ```
- This payload demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary operating system commands.
