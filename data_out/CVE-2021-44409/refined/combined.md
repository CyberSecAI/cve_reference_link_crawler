### Summary

Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in the cgiserver.cgi JSON command parser functionality of reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136\_20121102. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to a reboot. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136\_20121102

### Product URLs

RLC-410W - <https://reolink.com/us/product/rlc-410w/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.6 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation

### Details

The reolink RLC-410W is a WiFi security camera. The camera includes motion detection functionalities and various methods to save the recordings.

The RLC-410W offers different APIs for different levels of authentication. One of these APIs has the purpose of rebooting the device; this API should be executed by administrator users only.

A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to kill the `cgiserver.cgi` process and a consequentially to the reboot of the device, without the required permission.

The `cgiserver.cgi` manages the API requests, parsing the commands and parameters provided. One way to issue commands and parameters is by providing those in a JSON array in the body. A body with commands looks like the following:

```
[
    {
        "cmd":    <COMMAND NAME 1>,
        "action": <ACTION NUMBER 1>,
        "param":{
                  <COMMAND PARAMETERS 1>
        }
    },
    ...
    {
        "cmd":    <COMMAND NAME n>,
        "action": <ACTION NUMBER n>,
        "param":{
                  <COMMAND PARAMETERS n>
        }
    },
]

```

All the JSON elements inside a JSON object are going to be accessed using the subscription operator:

```
int __thiscall Json::Value::operator[](Value *this,char *key)

{
  [...]

  puVar4 = &_mips_gp0_value;
  if (this->type == null) {
    Value(aVStack64,7);
    operator=(this,aVStack64);
    ~Value(aVStack64);
  }
  else {
    if (this->type != object) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
      __assert(s_type__==_nullValue_||_type__==_o_004e3084,
               "/home/mdq/new_svn/test/ipc/trunk/opensource/libjson/src/json_value.cpp",0x401);         [1]
    }
  }
 [...]
}

```

If the JSON element is neither of the type `null` or `object`, the program will assert. If this happens, the `cgiserver.cgi` process will not able to send its heartbeat. Eventually the entire device will be rebooted.

Each one of the provided commands is parsed by the `body_request_to_command`:

```
  undefined body_request_to_command(cgi_request *req,cgi_cmd *cgi_cmd,Value *json_element)

  {
    [...]
    pVVar3 = (Value *)Json::Value::operator[](json_element,"cmd");                                      [2]
    [...]
  }

```

In `[2]` the `json_element` represents one of the elements of the array that contains the commands.

Instead, each `param` object is parsed individually for each API. But the code that passes the `param` JSON object, as argument for the function, is the same for all the APIs. The API-specific `param` parser is called in the `cgi_param_parse` function:

```
int cgi_param_parse(cgi_cmd *cgi_cmd,cgi_session *session)

      {
        [...]

        Json::Reader::Reader(json_reader);
        Json::Value::Value(&body_as_json,0);
        pcVar1 = cgi_cmd->associated_request;
        if (pcVar1->is_commands_in_body == 0) {
          API_command = cgi_cmd->command_ID;
      CHECK_PERMISSIONS:
          iVar3 = check_channel_if_command_require_it(API_command,cgi_cmd->query_string[channel]);
          if (iVar3 == 0) {
            AVar4 = cgi_check_ability(cgi_cmd->command_ID,session,cgi_cmd->query_string[channel]);      [3]
            dVar5 = 0;
            if (AVar4 == ~not exist) goto LAB_0043ca18;
          }
          else {
            AVar4 = check err;
          }
        }
        else {
          if (pcVar1->CONTENT_LENGTH == 0) {
            API_command = cgi_cmd->command_ID;
            goto CHECK_PERMISSIONS;
          }
          std::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>>::basic_string
                    ((char *)body_data_as_string,(allocator *)pcVar1->body_data);
          is_valid_json = Json::Reader::parse(json_reader,body_data_as_string,&body_as_json,true);
          std::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>>::~basic_string
                    ((basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>> *)body_data_as_string
                    );
          if (is_valid_json != 0) {
            command_struct = (command_struct *)get_command_struct_by_id(cgi_cmd->command_ID);
            j2s_function = command_struct->j2s;
            pVVar2 = (Value *)Json::Value::operator[](&body_as_json,cgi_cmd->idx_in_array_command);
            pVVar2 = (Value *)Json::Value::operator[](pVVar2,"param");                                  [4]
            dVar5 = (*j2s_function)(pVVar2,cgi_cmd);                                                    [5]
            if (dVar5 != 0) goto LAB_0043ca18;
            API_command = cgi_cmd->command_ID;
            goto CHECK_PERMISSIONS;
          }
        [...]
      }

```

At `[4]` the `param` element is taken and passed at `[5]` to the API-specific JSON parser that will parse the parameters. After the parsing, at `[3]`, it is checked that the user who requested the API has the correct permission for performing it.

Both the code at `[2]` and the code called to parse the `param` JSON element at `[5]` assume that the JSON passed are JSON objects, but this is not always the case. For example with:

```
curl --request POST \
     --data "[{\"cmd\": \"<CMD_NAME>\",\"action\": 0,\"param\":  \"\"}]" \
     http://<CAMERA_IP>/cgi-bin/api.cgi\?cmd\=<CMD_NAME>&token\=<SESSION_TOKEN>

```

Based on the `CMD_NAME`, this request could crash the device, because at `[5]` the `param` JSON element is taken and passed to the `CMD_NAME` API-specific parameters parser. In various APIs, that requires `param`. The parser code will assume, erroneously, that the JSON element of `param` is an object, accessing it with the subscription operator, leading to the assert at `[1]`.

Note that, while most of this requires a logged-in user, it’s possible to use TALOS-2021-1420 to perform these API calls without authentication.
