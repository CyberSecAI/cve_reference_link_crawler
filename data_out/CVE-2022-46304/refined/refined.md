- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ServiSign component does not properly filter special characters in parameters returned from a connection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary system commands, manipulate the system, or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can create a malicious website. When a user with the vulnerable component installed visits the malicious site, it triggers the command injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior authorization or privileges. The user needs to be lured to a malicious website to trigger the exploit.
