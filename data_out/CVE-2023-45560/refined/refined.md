Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of secret in Yasukawa memberscard

**Affected Product:** Yasukawa memberscard (a mini-app within Line)

**Affected Version:** v13.6.1

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The mini-app 'Yasukawa memberscard' exposes the 'client secret' in the client-side response of the request to `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`. This secret should never be exposed to the client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The client secret, a critical credential, is being leaked in the response of an API call. This violates the principle of least privilege and exposes a sensitive credential.
* **Insecure Storage/Transmission:** The secret is being transmitted and available within the client-side context instead of being securely stored and handled server-side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Acquisition of Channel Access Token:** The leaked client secret can be used to obtain a channel access token.
* **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** The channel access token is used to secure communication within Line. An attacker who obtains the token can use it to broadcast malicious messages, including links to malicious websites, fraudulent information, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network Sniffing/Interception:**  An attacker can intercept the network traffic to obtain the client secret from the API response.
* **Client-Side Inspection:** A user can inspect the network traffic of the Line app using browser developer tools or other intercepting proxies and observe the client secret.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker can position themselves to intercept communications to obtain the client secret during transmission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have access to the network traffic of the Line app when interacting with the vulnerable mini-app.
* No special system access or privileges are needed on the userâ€™s device; the vulnerability resides in the app itself.
* The attacker needs knowledge of the API request and response that leaks the secret.
