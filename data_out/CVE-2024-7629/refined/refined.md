- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Responsive Video plugin's video settings function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the plugin's video settings function. Attackers inject malicious scripts via user-supplied attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher. They also need responsive videos to be enabled for posts.
