- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `wr_content` parameter in the `/board/write_update/free` endpoint is not sanitized, allowing users to inject HTML tags, including `<script>` tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected content, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: By submitting a POST request to `/board/write_update/free` with a crafted `wr_content` parameter containing malicious script tags.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to post content (e.g., a comment) on the affected board. This can often be done by any logged in user. The attacker needs to be able to modify HTTP parameters, meaning direct access to the web application is required.
