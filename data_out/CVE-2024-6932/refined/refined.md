{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input in the 'order' parameter when constructing the HTML page, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to a malicious website. Specifically, the provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how an attacker can steal an administrator's session cookie by enticing them to visit a crafted URL.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious payload in the 'order' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim (preferably an administrator) into visiting the link."
