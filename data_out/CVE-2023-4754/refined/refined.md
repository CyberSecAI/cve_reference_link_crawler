The provided content includes a commit from the GPAC project that addresses issue #2582, which is related to a vulnerability in `src/scene_manager/swf_parse.c`. The commit modifies the code to fix an out-of-bounds write issue.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect calculation of the offset table size. The code allocates memory for `offset_table` based on `ft->nbGlyphs`, then in the `for` loop, it attempts to write to `offset_table[i]` using a loop starting from `i=1` up to `ft->nbGlyphs`. This writes `ft->nbGlyphs-1` entries, but, in the prior step, it always sets the first entry: `offset_table[0] = 0;`. This is later used for a for loop where it reads up to and including `ft->nbGlyphs`. As such it will write out-of-bounds.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An out-of-bounds write can potentially lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
A specially crafted SWF file can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious SWF file.

The commit fixes the issue by correctly initializing the first entry of the `offset_table`, prior to setting values in the loop. This prevents the out of bounds write.
