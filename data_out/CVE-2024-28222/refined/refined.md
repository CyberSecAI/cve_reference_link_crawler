- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NetBackup BPCD process inadequately validates the file path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient file path validation. This allows an attacker to upload and execute a custom file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) on NetBackup servers and clients.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can be remote.
