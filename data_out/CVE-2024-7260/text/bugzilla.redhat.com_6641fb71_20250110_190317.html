| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2301875#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-07-31 03:05:09 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. A specially crafted URL can be constructed where the referrer and referrer_uri parameters are made to trick a user to visit a malicious webpage; this vulnerability is called an Open Redirect.  A trusted URL can fool both users and automation into believing that the URL is safe when in fact it redirects to a malicious server. This can result in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination of the redirect, potentially leading to a successful phishing attack or other types of attacks.  Once a crafted URL is made, it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via email for example, and it will trigger this vulnerability when the user visits the page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can target users whom they know are Keycloak admins for further attacks in this way. It may be possible to bypass other domain-related security checks, such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri. Finally, the malicious actor can further obfuscate the redirect_uri using URL encoding, to hide the text of the actual malicious website domain.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2301875#c1)  Bruno Oliveira    2024-07-31 14:51:30 UTC  ``` Please add the steps to reproduce.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2301875#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:05:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 24  Via RHSA-2024:6502 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6502](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6502)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2301875#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:05:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6503 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6503](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6503)   ``` |  |
