Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-25973:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient filtering and sanitization of user-supplied input. This allows the injection of XSS payloads into various fields such as course names, catalog names, curriculum names and media file alt texts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS due to lack of proper input sanitization. User-controlled input is stored and later displayed without proper encoding, allowing execution of malicious JavaScript.
*   **Insecure Content Security Policy (CSP):** Although this is a separate issue, the default "report-only" CSP and use of "unsafe-eval" facilitates privilege escalation when combined with stored XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a victim's browser when they view the affected content, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Privilege escalation
*   **Privilege escalation:** By leveraging the XSS vulnerabilities and insecure CSP, an attacker can potentially elevate their privileges to administrative level.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Course names:** An attacker with rights to create or edit courses can inject XSS payloads within the course name.
*   **Catalog names:** An attacker with rights to create or rename catalogs can inject XSS payloads within the catalog name.
*   **Curriculum names:** An attacker with rights to create curriculums can inject XSS payloads within the curriculum name.
*  **Media file alt-text:** An attacker with rights to upload media files can inject XSS payloads within the alt-text field of an image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of OpenOLAT.
*   The attacker needs appropriate permissions to create/edit groups, courses, catalogs, curriculums, or upload media files, depending on the specific XSS vulnerability being exploited.
*  For privilege escalation, the attacker needs to be able to store XSS payloads and have a readable context on the page to trigger the payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) examples showing how to exploit the different stored XSS vulnerabilities using specific payloads.
*   The content includes details of how to exploit the "unsafe-eval" CSP in combination with the stored XSS vulnerabilities to achieve privilege escalation.
*   The advisory includes details of vendor communication and the timeline of the vulnerability disclosure.
*   The content also mentions a separate CVE (CVE-2024-25974) related to stored XSS within the Media Center (uploading SVG files)
*   The content states that the vulnerabilities were fixed in OpenOLAT versions 18.1.6 and 18.2.

This is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing specific vulnerable locations, attack vectors, and the possibility of privilege escalation due to an insecure default CSP configuration.
