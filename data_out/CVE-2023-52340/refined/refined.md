Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 routing cache was managed. Prior to the fix, the `ip6_dst_gc()` function was checking against a maximum size (`net->ipv6.sysctl.ip6_rt_max_size`) before triggering garbage collection. This check was not present for IPv4. Due to this, when IPv6 packets are sent in a loop via a raw socket, a route is cloned by `ip6_rt_cache_alloc()` for each packet. This leads to rapid consumption of the IPv6 `max_size` threshold, which defaults to 4096 and results in a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Max Size Check:** The core issue was the presence of a maximum size check for the IPv6 route cache (`ip6_dst_gc()`) that was not in sync with IPv4's behavior. This limit caused the route cache to fill up, leading to packet drops.
- **Missing Garbage Collection Trigger:** The garbage collection was not being triggered early enough for Ipv6, causing route cache exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  When the IPv6 route cache fills up, new IPv6 packets get dropped, causing a denial of service. The `sendto()` function begins to return a "network is unreachable" error.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Sending a large number of IPv6 packets in a loop via a raw socket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 packets to a vulnerable system, typically through a network connection. No specific user level is mentioned.
- No specialized knowledge is required beyond the ability to send raw IPv6 packets.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involved removing the max size check in `ip6_dst_gc()` and making it align with IPv4's behavior, which does not have such a check. Now, the garbage collection is triggered based on the number of entries exceeding the `gc_thresh`. The max size was set to `INT_MAX`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by cloning a route for each packet sent.
-  The advisory also contains a comprehensive list of affected and unaffected NetApp products.
-  NetApp provides links to specific patches for affected products.
