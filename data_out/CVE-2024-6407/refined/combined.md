General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Passwords should include upper case, lower case, number and special characters, a

length of 20 characters is ideal.

•  A default Admin password must be changed immediately when first received and after a

factory reset.

•  Device should only be used in a personal home network.
•  Device should not have a publicly accessible IP address.
•  Do NOT use port forwarding to access a device from the public internet.
•  A device should be on its own network segment. If your router supports a guest network

or VLAN, it is preferable to locate the device there.

•  Use the strongest Wi-Fi encryption available, such as WPA3 or WPA2/3 with protected

management frames.

•  Schedule regular reboots of your routing device, smartphones, and computers.
•  Ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain physical access to your devices (USB

or LAN ports should be easily accessible.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best
Practices document.
