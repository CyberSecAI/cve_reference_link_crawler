- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The blog title within the settings of the Stupid Simple CMS (Blogger) application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the blog title which can then be executed when a user views the title, leading to potential information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By modifying the blog title through the settings page, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the blog title settings. This typically implies the attacker is an authenticated user or has gained access to an admin account.
