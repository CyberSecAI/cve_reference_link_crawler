{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper access control in Argo CD allows a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper access control",
    "Privilege escalation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user can escalate their privileges to admin-level, modify any resource on the Application's destination cluster, delete any resource on the Application's destination cluster, view any resource on the Application's destination cluster (except for the contents of Secrets), list actions available for that resource, view the logs of any Pods on the Application's destination cluster, and run an action for any resource on the Application's destination cluster.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository",
    "`sync` and `override` access to an Application",
    "Knowledge of the involved object's name, UID, and namespace for Events exploit"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authorized Argo CD user with push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Additionally, `update`, `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications is required for specific exploits. For the Events exploit, only get access is required, along with knowing the involved object's name, UID, and namespace."
