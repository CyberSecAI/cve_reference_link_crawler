Prevent remote shell execution in `#apply`

```
If the operations are coming from user input, this could allow the user
to execute arbitrary shell commands via `Kernel#system` and
`Kernel#spawn`:

  ImageProcessing::Vips.apply({ system: "echo something" })

We prevent this by using `#public_send` instead of `#send`, which goes
to method missing instead of calling private methods, which include
`Kernel#system` and `Kernel#spawn`.
```

Package        : ruby-image-processing
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-24720
Debian Bug     : 1007225

It was discovered that ruby-image-processing, a ruby package that
provides higher-level image processing helpers, is prone to a remote
shell execution vulnerability when using the #apply method to apply a
series of operations coming from unsanitized user input.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.3-1+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-image-processing packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-image-processing please refer
to its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-image-processing>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

# Remote shell execution vulnerability in ImageProcessing

High

[janko](/janko)
published
GHSA-cxf7-qrc5-9446
Mar 1, 2022

## Package

bundler

image\_processing
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 1.12.1

## Patched versions

1.12.2

## Description

### Impact

When using the `#apply` method from image\_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input, this allows the attacker to execute shell commands:

```
ImageProcessing::Vips.apply({ system: "echo EXECUTED" })
#>> EXECUTED
```

This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image\_processing.

### Workarounds

If you're processing based on user input, it's highly recommended that you always sanitize the user input, by allowing only a constrained set of operations. For example:

```
operations = params[:operations]
  .map { |operation| [operation[:name], *operation[:value]] }
  .select { |name, *| name.to_s.include? %w[resize_to_limit strip ...] } # sanitization

ImageProcessing::Vips.apply(operations)
```

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24720
