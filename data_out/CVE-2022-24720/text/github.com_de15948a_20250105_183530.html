# Remote shell execution vulnerability in ImageProcessing

High

[janko](/janko)
published
GHSA-cxf7-qrc5-9446
Mar 1, 2022

## Package

bundler

image\_processing
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 1.12.1

## Patched versions

1.12.2

## Description

### Impact

When using the `#apply` method from image\_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input, this allows the attacker to execute shell commands:

```
ImageProcessing::Vips.apply({ system: "echo EXECUTED" })
#>> EXECUTED
```

This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image\_processing.

### Workarounds

If you're processing based on user input, it's highly recommended that you always sanitize the user input, by allowing only a constrained set of operations. For example:

```
operations = params[:operations]
  .map { |operation| [operation[:name], *operation[:value]] }
  .select { |name, *| name.to_s.include? %w[resize_to_limit strip ...] } # sanitization

ImageProcessing::Vips.apply(operations)
```

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24720

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
