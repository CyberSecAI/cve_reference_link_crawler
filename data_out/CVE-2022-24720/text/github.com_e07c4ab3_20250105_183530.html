Prevent remote shell execution in `#apply`

```
If the operations are coming from user input, this could allow the user
to execute arbitrary shell commands via `Kernel#system` and
`Kernel#spawn`:

  ImageProcessing::Vips.apply({ system: "echo something" })

We prevent this by using `#public_send` instead of `#send`, which goes
to method missing instead of calling private methods, which include
`Kernel#system` and `Kernel#spawn`.
```
