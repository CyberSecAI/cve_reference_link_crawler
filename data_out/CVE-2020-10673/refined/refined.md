  "CVE-2020-10673": {
    "Description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.4 mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to com.caucho.config.types.ResourceRef (aka caucho-quercus).",
    "Root cause": "Mishandling of interaction between serialization gadgets and typing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of untrusted data using polymorphic typing with vulnerable classes present in the classpath."
    ],
    "Impact": "Disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Sending malicious JSON content to an endpoint that uses Jackson for deserialization."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send JSON data to a vulnerable endpoint, which includes a vulnerable gadget class and that has polymorphic type handling enabled for Object or other permissive base types such as java.util.Serializable and java.lang.Cloneable"
