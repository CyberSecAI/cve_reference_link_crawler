- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact may vary depending on the function affected.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker through a function that lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber to exploit this vulnerability.
