Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Netgsm plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce proper authorization, authentication, or nonce checks, allowing unauthorized access to functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (subscriber role) could perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis, meaning that the exact action that can be performed is not described.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting a function within the plugin that is missing access control checks. This can be performed by a user with a "subscriber" role, implying that no elevated privileges are required to initiate the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user with "subscriber" privileges on the WordPress site.
- The attacker would need to identify and call the vulnerable function missing access controls.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability has a low severity rating with a CVSS score of 4.3.
- The affected plugin is the WordPress Netgsm Plugin, versions 2.9.32 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.9.33.
- A virtual patch is available via Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
