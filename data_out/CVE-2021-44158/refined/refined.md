- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ASUS RT-AX56U wireless router's httpd configuration lacks parameter length validation, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to missing parameter length validation in the httpd configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker on the local network, with regular user privileges, can execute arbitrary code. This allows for complete system control or denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who is on the same local network as the router and has valid user credentials to log in to the router's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable ASUS RT-AX56U router and have valid user credentials to login to the router's web interface.
