Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2781:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The provided content, specifically from the Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu security advisories, directly mentions `CVE-2018-2781` in relation to vulnerabilities in MySQL and MariaDB. This aligns with the CVE's description of a MySQL vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The root cause is described as an "unspecified vulnerability" in the "Server: Optimizer" component of MySQL.
*   It is not a bug in the code that is being used to exploit the issue but rather an unspecified bug in server optimizer component of the MySQL server code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   The weakness is an unspecified vulnerability within the MySQL server optimizer. The exact nature of the flaw isn't detailed in these documents but is within the optimizer of the SQL server itself.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   The impact of exploiting CVE-2018-2781 could lead to a hang or a frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of the MySQL server.
*  It may also lead to unauthorized modification of server accessible data.
* Red Hat also mentions the "mysql: Server: Optimizer multiple unspecified vulnerabilities (CPU Apr 2018) (CVE-2018-2775, CVE-2018-2778, CVE-2018-2779, CVE-2018-2780, CVE-2018-2781, CVE-2018-2812, CVE-2018-2816)", thus meaning the impact of the exploitable bugs include a range of issues related to the optimizer.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   The attack vector is via the MySQL protocol, likely by crafting specific SQL queries or operations that trigger the optimizer vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is considered a network-based attack and may be remotely exploitable without authentication, however, some information says that it needs some level of local access.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   An attacker would need the capability to send requests over the MySQL protocol. Depending on configuration, this could mean a local attacker, an internal attacker on the network, or a remote attacker with network access to the MySQL server.
*   Some access to the server itself may be required, however, an unauthenticated user may also be able to make use of the flaw.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information is somewhat vague due to the "unspecified" nature of the vulnerability, and the exact attack methodology isn't detailed. This is typical for initial security advisories, which may reveal more technical details at a later time.
*   The advisories recommend updating to the patched version of MySQL or MariaDB as the primary method of remediation.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL server optimizer.
*   **Vulnerability:** An unspecified flaw in the query optimizer leading to potential crashes.
*   **Impact:** Potential DoS (Denial of Service) or unauthorized data modification of MySQL server.
*   **Attack Vector:** MySQL protocol
*    **Required Capabilities:** Network access to MySQL server and some level of database interaction.
