| **Description:** | Symantec Endpoint Protection, prior to 14.3 RU6 (14.3.9210.6000), may be susceptible to a Elevation of Privilege vulnerability, which is a type of issue whereby an attacker may attempt to compromise the software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. |

**Mitigation & Additional Information**

The following client updates have been made available to customers to remediate these issues:

* SEP 14.3 RU3 (14.3.5470.3000)
* SEP 14.3 RU4 (14.3.7419.4000)
* SEP 14.3 RU5 (14.3.8289.5000)

The latest Symantec Endpoint Protection releases and patches are available to customers through normal support channels. 14.3 RU3 (14.3.5470.3000) and 14.3 RU4 (14.3.7419.4000) Client Import Packages are available via the [Cyber Security Software Download Portal](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/142814/). 14.3 RU5 (14.3.8289.5000) and 14.3 RU6 (14.3.9210.6000) are available via Symantec LiveUpdate for Cloud-Managed and On-Premise customers.

Symantec recommends the following measures to reduce risk of attack:

* Restrict access to administrative or management systems to authorized privileged users.
* Restrict remote access to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Run under the principle of least privilege, where possible, to limit the impact of potential exploit.
* Keep all operating systems and applications current with vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. At a minimum, run both firewall and anti-malware applications to provide multiple points of detection and protection for both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in the detection of attacks or malicious activity related to the exploitation of latent vulnerabilities.
