- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing X_B files within Ansys SpaceClaim. This allows a write operation to occur beyond the boundaries of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation when parsing X_B files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction. An attacker can deliver a malicious X_B file, which the target must open in Ansys SpaceClaim. Alternatively, the target could be lured to visit a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to deliver a specially crafted X_B file to the user or host a malicious website, and the victim needs to interact with it by opening the file with the vulnerable software, or visit the malicious website.
