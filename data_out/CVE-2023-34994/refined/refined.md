- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper resource allocation in the OAS Engine configuration management functionality. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the ability of an authenticated user to create new directories through a remote file browser without proper resource limits.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling. The application allows the creation of arbitrary directories without limiting or throttling the resource consumption.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger the vulnerability which results in the creation of arbitrary directories on the file system.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted sequence of network requests, specifically using a `Create_Directory` protobuf as part of an authenticated request, can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the OAS Engine. This user does not need authorization on the underlying system.
