- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Cooked plugin for WordPress versions up to 1.7.15.4 lacks proper nonce validation on its AJAX action handler. This allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their consent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to missing or incorrect nonce validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a user into performing unintended actions under their current authentication. In this specific case, the provided exploit resets the recipe template to its default settings.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTML page that contains a form. The form targets the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint of the vulnerable WordPress site and uses a hidden input field to set the `action` parameter to `cooked_load_default`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user to visit the malicious HTML page. The attacker does not require any prior authentication or knowledge of the user's credentials beyond that they are logged into the vulnerable WordPress website.
