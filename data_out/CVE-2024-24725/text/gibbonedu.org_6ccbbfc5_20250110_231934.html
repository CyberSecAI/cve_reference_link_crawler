## Release Notes

Gibbon v28 sports an exciting front-end refresh powered by [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), replacing jQuery and various other front-end libraries. As well as considerable improvements to the UI, this refresh also includes quick-save forms, a nicer Fast Finder and snappier, more app-like page loads. v28 also includes a new Activities registration system, a new Mailing List feature in Messenger, more intuitive password policy visuals, and a raft of other improvements.

In addition, ownership of all Core modules has now been visibly moved to the Gibbon Foundation, where they are joined by the majority of our Additional modules. Via the Foundation we are also working on a new supporter system, which will allow schools to choose to donate ongoing financial support to our project, allowing us to ensure Gibbonâs long term future. In the meantime, if youâd like to offer us a leg-up on this front, please consider using the buttons below to make a one-time donation:

### Important Notes for v28.0.01

* Gibbon requires a minimum PHP version of 7.4 and MySQL version of 5.7. Please check to ensure your server supports this requirement. Gibbon v27 supports up to PHP 8.2 and MySQL 8.0, which are currently the highest recommended versions.
* If you are running Gibbon on PHP 8.3+, it is recommended to turn off deprecation messages through php.ini, as these messages are only intended for development purposes.
* Always backup your files and database before upgrading.
* If you are upgrading, please read the Changes With Important Notices section of [CHANGELOG.txt](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/blob/v28.0.01/CHANGELOG.txt) before you install, to see if your upgrade requires any manual intervention.
* See the [Updating Gibbon](https://docs.gibbonedu.org/administration/updating-gibbon) guide for detailed steps.

### Developer Notes

* Our Gibbon Development Road Map includes our GitHub branch, project board for v29 and future release dates. Take a look at <https://docs.gibbonedu.org/development/gibbon-road-map>.
