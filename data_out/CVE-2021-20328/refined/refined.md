- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MongoDB Java driver, in versions supporting client-side field level encryption (CSFLE), fails to perform proper hostname verification of the KMS server's certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper hostname verification during TLS/SSL handshake with the KMS server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a privileged network position and active MITM capabilities could intercept traffic between the Java driver and the KMS service, effectively rendering field level encryption ineffective, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network connection between the Java driver and the KMS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a privileged network position to perform the MITM attack. They also need to be able to actively intercept and modify network traffic.

The vulnerability specifically affects versions of the Java driver that support CSFLE and is not present in Java async, Scala, or reactive streams drivers. It also does not impact driver traffic with CSFLE-supported key services when originating from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure network fabrics due to compensating controls in those environments. Workloads that do not use Field Level Encryption are also not affected. The vulnerability was discovered internally. The document provides specific details of the affected versions and the fixed versions for multiple libraries and includes the CVSS score and vector.
