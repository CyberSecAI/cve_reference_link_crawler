{
  "CVE-2024-49952": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel's netfilter nf_tables component has a race condition in nf_dup_ipv4() and nf_dup_ipv6() when writing to the per-cpu variable nf_skb_duplicated. This occurs because preemption is disabled but soft interrupts are not when writing to this variable. This can cause data corruption.",
    "root_cause": "The functions `nf_dup_ipv4()` and `nf_dup_ipv6()` were writing to the per-cpu variable `nf_skb_duplicated` while only disabling preemption, not soft interrupts, leading to a race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Improper synchronization"
    ],
    "impact": "Data corruption due to concurrent access to a shared per-cpu variable.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the nf_dup_ipv4() or nf_dup_ipv6() functions are called which are part of the netfilter framework. The specific scenario involves using the `nft_dup` expression within `nf_tables`.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to craft network packets that will be processed by the netfilter framework and trigger the `nft_dup` expression. This requires the ability to install netfilter rules or send network traffic that will match the `nft_dup` rule."
