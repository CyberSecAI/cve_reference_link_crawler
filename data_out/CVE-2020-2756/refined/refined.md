Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of serial ENUMs within the OpenJDK Java runtime. Specifically, it involves issues with how the runtime maps or processes serialized enumeration types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue is related to object deserialization. The vulnerability is triggered during the process of reading and interpreting serialized data streams, where a specific weakness in handling ENUMs leads to a exploitable condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker can craft a specific serialized input that triggers the flaw, causing the affected Java application or service to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves providing specially crafted serialized input to a Java application. This could occur through various means, such as:
  - Sending malicious data over a network.
  - Reading a specially crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs the ability to send serialized data to a Java application that uses a vulnerable version of OpenJDK
  - No special privileges are required, just the ability to provide the specific input.
  - The attacker does not need to be local, this is a remote vulnerability
  - High complexity is noted in some advisories, which could imply it requires intricate crafted input

**Additional Notes:**
  - The provided content suggests that this vulnerability is often addressed in conjunction with other related OpenJDK vulnerabilities.
  - Some sources classify the CVSS score of this CVE as low, while others classify it as medium or high, which implies the severity can vary on context.
