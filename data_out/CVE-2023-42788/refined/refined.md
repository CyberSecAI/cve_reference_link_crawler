Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-42788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied parameters in certain CLI commands within FortiManager. Specifically, when exporting files using commands like `diagnose system export umlog` or `fmwslog` to an external FTP/SFTP server, parameters such as hostname, user, password, and target filename are not properly sanitized. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious commands. Although some sanitization was attempted after a previous report (CVE-2021-26104), it was incomplete, leaving the system vulnerable to command injection through parameters passed to the underlying `tar` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands due to a lack of proper input sanitization.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided parameters, specifically when exporting logs.
- Incomplete Fix: The previous fix for CVE-2021-26104 was not comprehensive, and bypasses using `tar` command parameters were not addressed.
- Lack of Countermeasures: The system does not have adequate countermeasures, and all processes run with root privileges, making exploitation easier.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the vulnerable FortiManager device.
- Root Shell Access: The attacker can obtain an interactive root shell on the device.
- Full System Compromise: With root access, an attacker can potentially gain full control of the FortiManager system, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- CLI Commands: The attack vector involves using vulnerable `diagnose` commands via the command-line interface.
- Crafted Parameters: The attack requires crafting malicious parameters to inject commands into the vulnerable CLI commands, specifically while specifying the export target (e.g., FTP server) and filename.
- `tar` command parameters such as `--checkpoint` and `--checkpoint-action` can be abused.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the FortiManager device.
- Privileged User: The attacker must have a privileged user account on the FortiManager device with the "System Settings" privilege.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI): The attacker must be able to access and interact with the device through the CLI.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions**: FortiManager versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.3 are affected, specifically. Other versions are also affected
*   **Patched Versions**: FortiManager version 7.2.4 and above includes the fix. Other versions also have fixes
*   **Severity**: The vulnerability is rated as High, with a CVSS v3 score of 7.6 (according to the Fortinet advisory) and 6.7 from the github advisory.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof of concept shows how to achieve code execution through a crafted FTP export of `umlog` using `tar` parameters.
*   **Vendor Advisory**: Fortinet has published an advisory, FG-IR-23-167, regarding this vulnerability.
*   **Re-occurrence**: This vulnerability is a re-occurrence of a previously reported issue, CVE-2021-26104, which was not completely fixed.
