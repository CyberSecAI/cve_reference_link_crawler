The Visualizer: Tables and Charts Manager for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and retrieval of data due to a missing capability check on the getQueryData() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.15. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform arbitrary SQL queries that can be leveraged for privilege escalation among many other actions.
