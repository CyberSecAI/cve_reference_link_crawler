### CVE-2024-3750
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-3750.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a missing authorization check within the `getQueryData()` function of the Visualizer: Tables and Charts Manager for WordPress plugin. This function allows users to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the WordPress database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing authorization check:** The `getQueryData()` function lacks a capability check, allowing authenticated users with minimal privileges (subscriber-level access and above) to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:**  The vulnerability permits attackers to craft and execute custom SQL queries, enabling them to bypass the intended restrictions of the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** Attackers can use the arbitrary SQL execution to create administrator accounts or modify existing user roles, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Data modification/retrieval:** Attackers can modify or extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Other malicious actions:** The vulnerability could be used for a variety of other malicious actions including potentially complete compromise of the affected site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning that the attacker sends requests over a network to exploit the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site. This means the attacker needs to have an active user account with subscriber-level access or higher.
