Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to **SQL injection** in the `delete_user()` function within the `rental/admin_class.php` file.
- The `$id` variable, used in the SQL query, is directly concatenated without proper sanitization or filtering. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct use of user-supplied input (`$id`) in a SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- **Data Manipulation/Extraction:**  This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Denial of Service:** By injecting time-based SQL queries (like `sleep()`), an attacker can potentially cause delays and degrade the application's performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out via an HTTP POST request to the `ajax.php?action=delete_user` endpoint.
- **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is injected through the `id` parameter in the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint/parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/ajax.php?action=delete_user`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
- **No authentication/authorization:** The provided exploit doesn't show any authentication bypass. However, the vulnerability exists in the admin section, meaning the attacker will need credentials to access the admin panel to exploit it.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a time-based SQL injection technique to confirm the vulnerability.
- The PoC payload `id=2 or (select(123)from(select(sleep(6)))x)#a` is injected into the id parameter.
- The `sleep(6)` function in the injected SQL query causes the database to pause for 6 seconds, confirming successful SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `delete_user()` function.
- The application is identified as "SourceCodester Best House Rental Management System 1.0".
- The submission on VulDB mentions another potential vulnerability in `save_user` function, but the provided details only focus on `delete_user` and SQL injection.

This analysis provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.
