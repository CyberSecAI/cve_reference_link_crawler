The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47215.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the handling of TLS RX resynchronization within the Mellanox mlx5e driver. Specifically, the resync_handle_seq_match function could lead to list corruption when adding TLS contexts to a list for resync. The list was not properly protected against concurrent modifications, particularly when entries were being moved due to resync_handle_seq_match while the napi (network API) was handling their resync completion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition: The core issue lies in concurrent access and modification of the list of TLS contexts requiring resynchronization.
- List corruption: The lack of proper locking mechanisms before the fix allows race conditions which can lead to list corruptions (potentially use-after-free due to invalid list structure).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash: List corruptions due to race conditions in the resync flow can lead to kernel crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network traffic: The vulnerability is triggered by specific network traffic patterns that require TLS RX resynchronization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network traffic: An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic that triggers the TLS RX resync flow within the mlx5e driver to exploit the vulnerability.
