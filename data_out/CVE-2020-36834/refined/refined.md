Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Discount Rules for WooCommerce plugin lacks proper authorization and nonce token checks on several AJAX actions. This allows unauthorized users to access and execute functions intended for administrators.
*   Specifically, the `wdr_ajax_requests` function, which handles multiple AJAX actions, is registered for both logged-in and non-logged-in users (`wp_ajax_wdr_ajax` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_wdr_ajax`).
*   Even when logged in, the `wp_ajax_wdr_ajax` action lacks authorization or CSRF checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** Several AJAX actions, intended for administrators, can be accessed and executed by any user, including unauthenticated users.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Vulnerability:** The lack of CSRF checks allows attackers to potentially trick administrators into performing actions through malicious requests.
*   **Unauthenticated Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Vulnerable methods such as `wdr_ajax_save_configuration` allow the injection of malicious scripts into configuration settings, which could lead to XSS on both the frontend and backend.  The plugin allows modification of settings that display to the user, such as the sale badge, which can be used to inject javascript that executes when a user views the site.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `wdr_ajax_duplicate_rule` method is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses the `rowid` POST parameter in a SQL query without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify discount rules, potentially causing financial loss to the store.
*   **Configuration Modification:** Unauthenticated users can change plugin settings, potentially causing financial loss or injecting malicious code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve a list of all users and coupon codes.
*   **Account Takeover/Remote Code Execution:** Through XSS, attackers could potentially achieve remote code execution on the admin screen.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that redirect users to attacker-controlled sites.
*   **Website Defacement:** By injecting scripts, attackers can alter content on the site, including header, footer, and admin pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
*   **AJAX Actions:** Attackers can exploit this by sending specially crafted AJAX requests to the `wp_ajax_wdr_ajax` endpoint with malicious data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The most serious attacks can be carried out by unauthenticated users, making it easy for an attacker to target vulnerable sites.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to send HTTP requests to the target website.
*   **Basic knowledge of HTTP requests:** Attackers must be able to form requests with the correct parameters to trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was actively exploited, with attacks observed injecting malicious scripts.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.0 of the plugin, which introduced authorization and CSRF checks.

In summary, the vulnerability is due to a combination of missing authorization and CSRF checks, which allows for various attacks, including data manipulation, XSS, and SQL injection. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated users, which increases the severity of the impact.
