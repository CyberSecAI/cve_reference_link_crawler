Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `manage_question.php` file within the Simple Realtime Quiz System. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in an SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core issue is a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the `manage_question.php` URL to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to full database access, potentially allowing the attacker to view, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   The attacker could gain access to user credentials, quiz data, and potentially the system's underlying operating system, depending on the database configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `manage_question.php` file, manipulating the `id` parameter. For example: `GET /manage_question.php?id=1'` followed by SQL injection payload within the 'id' parameter such as `id=1' or 1=1-- -`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server hosting the Simple Realtime Quiz System.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs a fundamental understanding of HTTP requests and how to manipulate URL parameters.
*   **SQL Injection skills:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
