The provided content describes a blind SQL injection vulnerability in FengOffice version 3.11.1.2.

**Root Cause:**
The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the "dim" parameter within a URL related to the "Workspaces" functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize the "dim" parameter, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code. This is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker does not see the results of the query directly in the response, but can infer information based on response times or other indirect indicators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the server, depending on the database user's privileges. The provided material does not detail the specific data exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the application, specifically by manipulating the "dim" parameter within the URL used to access "Workspaces".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged into the FengOffice application to access the vulnerable functionality ("Workspaces").
- They can then inject SQL code into the "dim" parameter of the URL.
- The attacker can use automated tools like SQLMap to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability.
