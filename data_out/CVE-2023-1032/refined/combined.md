# USN-5977-1: Linux kernel (OEM) vulnerabilities

27 March 2023

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)

## Packages

* [linux-oem-6.0](/security/cves?package=linux-oem-6.0) - Linux kernel for OEM systems

## Details

It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation

in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2023-1281](/security/CVE-2023-1281))

It was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2

VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive

information from the host OS or other guest VMs. ([CVE-2022-2196](/security/CVE-2022-2196))

Thadeu Cascardo discovered that the io\_uring subsystem contained a double-

free vulnerability in certain memory allocation error conditions. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-1032](/security/CVE-2023-1032))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 22.04

* [linux-image-6.0.0-1013-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-6.0)
  -
  [6.0.0-1013.13](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-6.0/6.0.0-1013.13)
* [linux-image-oem-22.04b](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-6.0)
  -
  [6.0.0.1013.13](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-6.0/6.0.0.1013.13)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Subject: CVE-2023-1032 - Linux kernel io_uring IORING_OP_SOCKET double free

A double-free vulnerability was found in the handling of IORING_OP_SOCKET
operation with io_uring on the Linux kernel.

It was fixed by commit:

649c15c7691e9b13cbe9bf6c65c365350e056067 ("net: avoid double iput when sock_alloc_file fails")

It has been assigned CVE-2023-1032.

It affects kernel versions starting with 5.19-rc1 and should affect any
backports including commits da214a475f8bd1d3e9e7a19ddfeb4d1617551bab ("net: add
__sys_socket_file()") and 1374e08e2d44863c931910797852589803997668 ("io_uring:
add socket(2) support").

It requires a memory allocation failure to happen, which will be followed by a
double free of a recently allocated object.

Causing the memory allocation failure does not require much more than being in
a memory cgroup with a maximum allocation setup (systemd MemoryMax, for
example).

The double free happens with iput, which sets up a flag, and leads to a BUG_ON.
So, at least, a system crash is possible.

Cascardo.

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI

GRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2022-3424](/security/CVE-2022-3424))

Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-

after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2022-41218](/security/CVE-2022-41218))

It was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2022-47929](/security/CVE-2022-47929))

Thadeu Cascardo discovered that the io\_uring subsystem contained a double-

free vulnerability in certain memory allocation error conditions. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-1032](/security/CVE-2023-1032))

It was discovered that the module decompression implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle return values in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2023-22997](/security/CVE-2023-22997))

Lianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions,

leading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2023-26545](/security/CVE-2023-26545))

It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle a loop termination condition, leading to an

out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2023-26606](/security/CVE-2023-26606))

Wei Chen discovered that the DVB USB AZ6027 driver in the Linux kernel

contained a null pointer dereference when handling certain messages from

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)

## Packages

* [linux-oem-6.1](/security/cves?package=linux-oem-6.1) - Linux kernel for OEM systems

## Details

It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some

situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated

privileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for

the TCINDEX classifier has been removed. ([CVE-2023-1829](/security/CVE-2023-1829))

William Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in

certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2022-4269](/security/CVE-2022-4269))

Thadeu Cascardo discovered that the io\_uring subsystem contained a double-

free vulnerability in certain memory allocation error conditions. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-1032](/security/CVE-2023-1032))

It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1076](/security/CVE-2023-1076))

It was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2023-1077](/security/CVE-2023-1077))

It was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB

device to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1079](/security/CVE-2023-1079))

It was discovered that the io\_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly perform file table updates in some situations, leading to a null

pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1583](/security/CVE-2023-1583))

It was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-1670](/security/CVE-2023-1670))

It was discovered that the APM X-Gene SoC hardware monitoring driver in the

Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2023-1855](/security/CVE-2023-1855))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth HCI SDIO

driver, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1989](/security/CVE-2023-1989))

It was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device

removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1990](/security/CVE-2023-1990))

Jose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the Spectre Variant 2

mitigations with prctl syscall were insufficient in some situations. A

local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2023-1998](/security/CVE-2023-1998))

It was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-

after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug

in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-25012](/security/CVE-2023-25012))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the TLS subsystem in the

Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free or a null pointer dereference

vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2023-28466](/security/CVE-2023-28466))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly initialize some data structures, leading to an out-of-bounds

access vulnerability in certain situations. An attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2023-28866](/security/CVE-2023-28866))

Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86

processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers

in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a

denial of service (guest crash). ([CVE-2023-30456](/security/CVE-2023-30456))

Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared

receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-

free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2023-1118](/security/CVE-2023-1118))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 22.04

* [linux-image-6.1.0-1009-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-6.1)
  -
  [6.1.0-1009.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-6.1/6.1.0-1009.9)
* [linux-image-oem-22.04c](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-6.1)
  -
  [6.1.0.1009.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-6.1/6.1.0.1009.9)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
