Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2023-1032:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the io_uring subsystem of the Linux kernel when handling the `IORING_OP_SOCKET` operation. This occurs specifically under certain memory allocation error conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free vulnerability in the io_uring subsystem.
- The double free occurs due to a failure in memory allocation, specifically within the `sock_alloc_file` function. This failure triggers a scenario where a file structure is freed twice.
- The double free happens with `iput`, which sets up a flag, and leads to a BUG_ON.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (system crash)
-  The vulnerability leads to a `BUG_ON` which causes the kernel to panic and crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attacker

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a memory allocation failure within the kernel's io_uring subsystem when using `IORING_OP_SOCKET`.
- The attacker needs to be local, with the ability to interact with the io_uring subsystem.
- This can be achieved by manipulating memory cgroups to limit allocations (e.g., using systemd MemoryMax) and then triggering socket creation with io_uring.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions starting with 5.19-rc1 and backports including commits da214a475f8bd1d3e9e7a19ddfeb4d1617551bab and 1374e08e2d44863c931910797852589803997668.
- The vulnerability was fixed by commit `649c15c7691e9b13cbe9bf6c65c365350e056067` ("net: avoid double iput when sock_alloc_file fails").
