# USN-6033-1: Linux kernel (OEM) vulnerabilities

19 April 2023

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)

## Packages

* [linux-oem-6.1](/security/cves?package=linux-oem-6.1) - Linux kernel for OEM systems

## Details

It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some

situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated

privileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for

the TCINDEX classifier has been removed. ([CVE-2023-1829](/security/CVE-2023-1829))

William Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in

certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2022-4269](/security/CVE-2022-4269))

Thadeu Cascardo discovered that the io\_uring subsystem contained a double-

free vulnerability in certain memory allocation error conditions. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-1032](/security/CVE-2023-1032))

It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1076](/security/CVE-2023-1076))

It was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2023-1077](/security/CVE-2023-1077))

It was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB

device to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1079](/security/CVE-2023-1079))

It was discovered that the io\_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly perform file table updates in some situations, leading to a null

pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1583](/security/CVE-2023-1583))

It was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-1670](/security/CVE-2023-1670))

It was discovered that the APM X-Gene SoC hardware monitoring driver in the

Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2023-1855](/security/CVE-2023-1855))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth HCI SDIO

driver, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1989](/security/CVE-2023-1989))

It was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device

removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2023-1990](/security/CVE-2023-1990))

Jose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the Spectre Variant 2

mitigations with prctl syscall were insufficient in some situations. A

local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2023-1998](/security/CVE-2023-1998))

It was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-

after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug

in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-25012](/security/CVE-2023-25012))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the TLS subsystem in the

Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free or a null pointer dereference

vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2023-28466](/security/CVE-2023-28466))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly initialize some data structures, leading to an out-of-bounds

access vulnerability in certain situations. An attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2023-28866](/security/CVE-2023-28866))

Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86

processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers

in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a

denial of service (guest crash). ([CVE-2023-30456](/security/CVE-2023-30456))

Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared

receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-

free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2023-1118](/security/CVE-2023-1118))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 22.04

* [linux-image-6.1.0-1009-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-6.1)
  -
  [6.1.0-1009.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-6.1/6.1.0-1009.9)
* [linux-image-oem-22.04c](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-6.1)
  -
  [6.1.0.1009.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-6.1/6.1.0.1009.9)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
