Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `Master.php` file. The `id` parameter, received via the GET method, is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any security checks or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary information from the database, potentially including sensitive data such as user credentials, personal details, and other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cdsms/classes/Master.php` endpoint.
*   **`id` Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter within the GET request to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web application to send the malicious GET requests.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable endpoint (`/cdsms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_package`) and that the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Cookie**: The provided exploit requires a valid session cookie. This implies that the attacker may need to authenticate to the system (admin access was used in the provided example).

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit example demonstrates how an attacker could use `sqlmap` to extract the database name after authenticating to the web application.
* The vulnerable software is "Sourcecodester Car Driving School Management System v1.0".
*   The vulnerability exists in `Master.php` file related to `delete_package` functionality.
