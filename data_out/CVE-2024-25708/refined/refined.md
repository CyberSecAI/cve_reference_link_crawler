- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web application, where the application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the web page, potentially allowing injected scripts to be executed in the context of the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through the vulnerable web application. This could involve getting a user to click on a crafted link or exploiting an application's input fields that are not properly sanitized before being rendered in the web page.
