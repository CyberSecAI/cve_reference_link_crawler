- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Splashtop Streamer MSI installer uses a temporary folder with weak permissions during installation, allowing a local authenticated user to manipulate the process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Weak permissions on the temporary folder used by the installer.
    - The installer loads a `.reg` file from a user-writable location in the `%TEMP%` directory.
    - The installer runs the `reg` load command in the `SYSTEM` context.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation to `SYSTEM`. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with `SYSTEM` privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access to a system with Splashtop Streamer installed.
    - Re-triggering the installation process, either by keeping the original MSI or copying it back to its original execution location.
    - Manipulating the temporary folder by placing a malicious `.reg` file with a specific name, after deleting `SetupUtil.exe`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local authenticated user access.
    - Ability to write files to the `%TEMP%` directory.
    - Ability to re-run the installation process.
