Subject: Vulnerability in Jenkins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.

The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Jenkins 2.263
* Jenkins LTS 2.361.1

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:

SECURITY-2868 / CVE-2022-2048
Jenkins bundles Winstone-Jetty, a wrapper around Jetty, to act as HTTP and
servlet server when started using `java -jar jenkins.war`. This is how
Jenkins is run when using any of the installers or packages, but not when
run using servlet containers such as Tomcat.

Jenkins LTS 2.346.3 and earlier, 2.362 and earlier bundle versions of Jetty
affected by the security vulnerability CVE-2022-2048. This vulnerability
allows unauthenticated attackers to make the Jenkins UI unresponsive by
exploiting Jetty's handling of invalid HTTP/2 requests, causing a denial of
service.

NOTE: This only affects instances that enable HTTP/2, typically using the
`--http2Port` argument to `java -jar jenkins.war` or corresponding options
in service configuration files. It is disabled by default in all native
installers and the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project.

Package        : jetty9
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2047 CVE-2022-2048

Two security vulnerabilities were discovered in Jetty, a Java servlet engine
and webserver.

CVE-2022-2047

    In Eclipse Jetty the parsing of the authority segment of an http scheme
    URI, the Jetty HttpURI class improperly detects an invalid input as a
    hostname. This can lead to failures in a Proxy scenario.

CVE-2022-2048

    In Eclipse Jetty HTTP/2 server implementation, when encountering an invalid
    HTTP/2 request, the error handling has a bug that can wind up not properly
    cleaning up the active connections and associated resources. This can lead
    to a Denial of Service scenario where there are no enough resources left to
    process good requests.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.39-3+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

For the detailed security status of jetty9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>

# Invalid HTTP/2 requests can lead to denial of service

GHSA-wgmr-mf83-7x4j
Jul 7, 2022

## Package

maven

http2-server
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<=9.4.46,<=10.0.9,<=11.0.9

## Patched versions

9.4.47,10.0.10,11.0.10

## Description

### Description

Invalid HTTP/2 requests (for example, invalid URIs) are incorrectly handled by writing a blocking error response directly from the selector thread.

If the client manages to exhaust the HTTP/2 flow control window, or TCP congest the connection, the selector thread will be blocked trying to write the error response.

If this is repeated for all the selector threads, the server becomes unresponsive, causing the denial of service.

### Impact

A malicious client may render the server unresponsive.

### Patches

The fix is available in Jetty versions 9.4.47. 10.0.10, 11.0.10.

### Workarounds

No workaround available within Jetty itself.

One possible workaround is to filter the requests before sending them to Jetty (for example in a proxy)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
