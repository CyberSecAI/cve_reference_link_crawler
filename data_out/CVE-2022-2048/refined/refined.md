Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2022-2048:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Eclipse Jetty HTTP/2 server implementation.
*   When the server encounters an invalid HTTP/2 request, the error handling mechanism fails to properly clean up active connections and associated resources. Specifically, the server incorrectly handles invalid HTTP/2 requests by writing a blocking error response directly from the selector thread. If the client manages to exhaust the HTTP/2 flow control window or congest the TCP connection, the selector thread will be blocked trying to write the error response. If repeated for all the selector threads, the server becomes unresponsive

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper resource cleanup.
*   Incorrect handling of invalid HTTP/2 requests.
*   Blocking error handling that can stall selector threads

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious client can send a series of crafted invalid HTTP/2 requests to exhaust server resources, leading to an unresponsive server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based: Attackers can exploit this remotely by sending crafted HTTP/2 requests to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any authentication or user interaction.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the vulnerable Jetty server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.0 through 9.4.46, 10.0.0 through 10.0.9 and 11.0.0 through 11.0.9.
*   Patches are available in Jetty versions 9.4.47, 10.0.10, and 11.0.10.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable if HTTP/2 is enabled, typically by using the `--http2Port` argument.
*   A potential workaround is to filter requests before they reach the Jetty server (e.g., via a proxy).
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (High) with the vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
*   This vulnerability affects several NetApp products that incorporate the vulnerable versions of Eclipse Jetty.
