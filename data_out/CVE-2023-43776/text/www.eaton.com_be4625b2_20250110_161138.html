All versions prior to 2.02

Remediation & Mitigation

Remediation

The security vulnerability has been remediated by Eaton and a patched version has been released.
The customers and/or end-users using an easyE4 with hardware version 08 are requested to upgrade
to the latest easyE4 version 2.02 immediately.

Mitigation

the physical access to easyE4 program files prepared for use with SD card (*.PRG file ending).

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g., firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

v1.0

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.
•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices

(e.g. firewalls, data diodes).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords or

passphrases.

•  Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.
