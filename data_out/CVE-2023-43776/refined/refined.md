- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device password for the Eaton easyE4 PLC is stored with a weak encoding algorithm in the program file when exported to an SD card (.PRG file).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak encoding of the device password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the device due to the weak encoding, potentially leading to complete compromise (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the .PRG program file on an SD card.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the SD card containing the exported .PRG program file. Additionally, the attacker would need to be able to reverse or crack the weak encoding algorithm used to obtain the password.
