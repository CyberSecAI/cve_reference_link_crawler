{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `setWanCfg` function in the TOTOLINK LR350 router firmware is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability in the `setWanCfg` function, where the `hostName` parameter from a POST request is used in a `doSystem` call without proper sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system by injecting malicious commands into the `hostName` parameter.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `hostName` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface and must have a valid `SESSION_ID` cookie."
