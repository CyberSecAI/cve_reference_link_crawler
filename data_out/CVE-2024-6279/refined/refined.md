Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `examresults-par.php` file within the lahirudanushka School Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection is present due to the unsanitized input in the `examresults-par.php` file's `sid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially use SQL Injection to:
*   Read sensitive database information.
*   Modify database data.
*   Possibly gain control of the server depending on the database user permissions.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the application, specifically the `examresults-par.php` file. The attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `sid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the value of the `sid` parameter. The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability, since the endpoint is likely available to all users of the application.

This vulnerability is present in version 1.0.1 of the lahirudanushka School Management System and is located in the `examresults-par.php?sid=` endpoint.
