Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `Multiselect::getFilterConditionExt()` function within the Pimcore framework. This function fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `value` parameter of the `getFilterConditionExt` method within the `Multiselect` class is not escaped, allowing for arbitrary SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of user-supplied input before it is used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `value` parameter within the `Multiselect::getFilterConditionExt` function is directly concatenated into a SQL LIKE clause without proper escaping or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `value` parameter, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- **Data Manipulation/Exfiltration:** This can lead to unauthorized modification or deletion of data, as well as the potential extraction of sensitive information from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** As demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept (PoC), an attacker can escalate their privileges to at least admin level by manipulating user roles within the database.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, successful SQL injection could lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Grid Filter API:** The attack vector is through the `/admin/object/grid-proxy` endpoint, which is used for filtering data in admin grids. This endpoint is vulnerable due to its use of the `getFilterCondition()` function that calls the flawed `Multiselect::getFilterConditionExt()` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Backend User Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the backend of the Pimcore application, although not necessarily with admin privileges, but with object permissions.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `/admin/object/grid-proxy` endpoint to target the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JSON payload to inject SQL code through the `filter` parameter, which is used in the `Multiselect::getFilterConditionExt` method.
- **Access to CSRF Token and Session Cookie:** The attacker will need a valid `X-pimcore-csrf-token` and `PHPSESSID` cookie to successfully authenticate to the backend.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `models/DataObject/ClassDefinition/Data/Multiselect.php` file, specifically within the `getFilterConditionExt` function.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves escaping the input value with `Helper::escapeLike()` method before passing it into the SQL query within the `Multiselect::getFilterConditionExt()` method.
- The vulnerability is present in Pimcore versions prior to 11.1.1.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an unprivileged backend user can exploit the vulnerability to escalate their privileges.
- The vulnerability is assigned CVE ID: CVE-2023-47637.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 (High).
