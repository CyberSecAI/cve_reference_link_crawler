The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.7 via the 'uploadpath' parameter of the wordpress_file_upload shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload limited files to arbitrary locations on the web server.
