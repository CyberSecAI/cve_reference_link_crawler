SSA-516818: TCP Sequence Number Validation Vulnerability in the TCP/IP Stack of CP343-1 Devices

| Publication Date: | 2024-02-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-02-13 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 8.7 |

SUMMARY

Affected products incorrectly validate TCP sequence numbers. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition by injecting spoofed TCP RST packets.

Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Apply network segmentation and Defense-in-Depth practices to reduce likelihood of a threat actor to be able to reach a potentially vulnerable device

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
