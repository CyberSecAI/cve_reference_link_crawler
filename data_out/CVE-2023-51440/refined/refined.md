- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected products incorrectly validate TCP sequence numbers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of TCP sequence numbers (CWE-940: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can create a denial of service condition by injecting spoofed TCP RST packets.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attacks by injecting spoofed TCP RST packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not require any authentication.
