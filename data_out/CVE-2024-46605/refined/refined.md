Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46605:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of the "Description" field when editing an album. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the album description.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database and executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected album.
- CSRF: The exploit leverages the ability to make a cross-site request to change the victim's email, with the help of the XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Email address modification: The most direct impact is that an attacker can change the victim's email address without their consent or knowledge.
- Account Takeover: By changing the email address, the attacker can potentially gain complete control of the user's account using the "forgot password" feature.
- Potential for further malicious actions: With account control, the attacker could upload malicious files, access private data, or make unauthorized changes to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker, with admin access, crafts a malicious payload in the album description via the admin interface (/admin.php?page=album).
- The victim views the public album containing the malicious description.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to modify album descriptions.
- The attacker needs to know or find a public album that they can use as a vector to target other users.

**Technical Details from Exploit:**

The provided exploit code within the `CVE-2024-46605.md` file uses JavaScript to:

1.  **Fetch the User's Profile Page:**
    *   It sends a GET request to `/photos/profile.php` to retrieve the page HTML.
2.  **Extract the CSRF Token:**
    *   It parses the HTML response using `this.responseText.match(/name="pwg_token" value="([a-zA-Z0-9]+)"/)` to extract the value of the `pwg_token`. This token is used to prevent CSRF attacks.
3.  **Send a POST request to change email address:**
    *   Sends a POST request to `/photos/profile.php` using `XMLHttpRequest`.
    *   Sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to simulate a form submission.
    *   Sends the payload, which includes:
        *  `mail_address`: The attacker's desired email (`changed-by-stored-xss@test.com`).
        * `pwg_token`: The CSRF token obtained in step 2.
        * Other form fields that are required by the system to change email address.

The exploit leverages the stored XSS to execute this script within the context of the victim's browser.

**Affected Versions:**
- Piwigo <= 14.5.0
