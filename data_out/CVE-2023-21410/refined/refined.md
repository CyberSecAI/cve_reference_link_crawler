- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User-provided input is not sanitized in the "api.cgi" endpoint of the AXIS License Plate Verifier application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input sanitization, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malicious input via the "api.cgi" endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the "api.cgi" endpoint.
