We are happy to announce that the new patch releases for CKAN 2.9.x and 2.8.x are now available to download and install. Note that following our [revised release policy](https://ckan.org/blog/new-supported-versions-policy-going-forward), this will be the last patch release on the 2.8.x line.

These patch releases are particularly important to apply as they address a vulnerability in user registration ([CVE-2022-43685](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-43685)), so users should upgrade as soon as possible to the latest patch release for the CKAN version they are using.

Patch release upgrades are very straight-forward and do not contain any backwards incompatible changes or involve any change in the database or Solr schema.

For more details, check the CHANGELOG for the relevant version:

* <https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/changelog.html#v-2-9-7-2022-10-26>
* <https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/changelog.html#v-2-8-12-2022-10-26>

In case of doubt don't hesitate to ask for help. To discuss security related issues please email security@ckan.org. Otherwise you can ask your questions in the [Discussions](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/discussions) or the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ckan/chat).
As stated in the [release policy](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/upgrading/index.html), the latest patch release is the only one officially supported.
For details on how to upgrade, see the following links depending on your install method:

* [Package upgrade](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/upgrading/upgrade%20-package-to-patch-release.html)
* [Source upgrade](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/upgrading/upgrade-source.html)
