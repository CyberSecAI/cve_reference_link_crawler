Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6365

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability exists in the "Product Table by WBW" WordPress plugin, specifically in the `saveCustomTitle` function within the `wootablepress.php` file. It's a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to insufficient authorization checks and a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data when appending to the `languages/customTitle.php` file.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the combination of:
1. **Missing Authorization:** The `saveCustomTitle` function does not properly check if the user is authorized to perform the action before modifying the `customTitle.php` file. Although there's a check for `manage_options` capability, it is circumvented due to the way the data is passed.
2. **Lack of Sanitization:** The plugin uses `sanitize_text_field` to sanitize data, but it's insufficient to prevent code injection because it is used *after* potentially dangerous strings are extracted and included in a file. The extracted data is directly injected into a PHP file using `__('{$value}', 'woo-product-tables');` without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):** Specifically, PHP code injection is possible via unsanitized input being written to a `.php` file.
- **Missing Authentication:**  The `saveCustomTitle` function is accessible without proper authentication checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site. This could lead to:
- Complete compromise of the server.
- Data theft.
- Website defacement.
- Installation of malware or backdoors.
- Denial of Service

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `saveCustomTitle` function of the plugin.
- The attacker sends a malicious request to the WordPress site with crafted data in the `settings` parameter, specifically targeting the `order` parameter and/or the `phrases` parameters such as `empty_table`, `table_info`, etc.
- This malicious data is then processed and used to construct malicious PHP code that is appended to the `customTitle.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any specific privileges on the WordPress site.
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.2 of the plugin.
- The fix involved adding a capability check and sanitization of the values being injected into the `customTitle.php` file.
- The Wordfence article states the vulnerability is present in all versions <= 2.0.1, and it was publicly published on July 8, 2024.
