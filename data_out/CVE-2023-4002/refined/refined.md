**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `securityPolicyProjectAssign` mutation in GitLab's GraphQL API does not properly authorize the `securityPolicyProjectId` parameter. This allows any authenticated user with an EE license to link arbitrary security policy projects to projects or groups they have access to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The mutation lacks authorization checks on the `securityPolicyProjectId` parameter, which should restrict access based on user permissions.
- **Information Disclosure:** By linking a security policy project, an unauthorized user can view the configured security policies, potentially revealing sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to the security policies of other groups or projects that they are not meant to see.
- **Security Policy Exposure:**  Confidential security configurations are revealed to unauthorized users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **GraphQL Mutation:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted GraphQL mutation request.
- **API Access:**  A user with an EE license and access to the API is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a GitLab user with an EE license.
- **API Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send GraphQL requests.
- **Knowledge of Target Policy Project ID:** The attacker needs the ID of the target security policy project.
- **Access to Target Project/Group:** The attacker needs access to the project or group where they want to assign the policy.
