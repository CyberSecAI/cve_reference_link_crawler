{
  "CVE-2023-30132": {
    "root cause": "Insecure key generation for AES256 encryption.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The application uses a static string within the executable to derive the key for AES256 encryption in CBC mode.",
      "The same key and IV are used for encryption, further reducing security."
    ],
    "impact": "Sensitive information transmitted over the network and data at rest in configuration and report files can be decrypted by an attacker.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can reverse engineer the application to extract the static key.",
        "An attacker can intercept network traffic to obtain encrypted data, then decrypt using the static key.",
        "An attacker with local access can decrypt configuration files."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs reverse engineering capabilities and network sniffing capabilities (wireshark) on a system with the vulnerable software to capture encrypted data or local file access to view encrypted files."
