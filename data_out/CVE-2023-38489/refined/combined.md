## 🚨 Security release

This release fixes several vulnerabilities that were all responsibly reported to us in June 2023:

* [Insufficient Session Expiration after a password change](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-5mvj-rvp8-rf45) (high severity, CVSS score 7.3)
* [Field injection in the KirbyData text storage handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93) (high severity, CVSS score 7.1)
* [XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML data handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp) (medium severity, CVSS score 6.8)
* [Cross-site scripting (XSS) from MIME type auto-detection of uploaded files](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.7)
* [Denial of service from unlimited password lengths](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-3v6j-v3qc-cxff) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.3)

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)), Alexandre Zanni ([@noraj](https://github.com/noraj)) at [ACCEIS](https://www.acceis.fr/) and Patrick Falb ([@dapatrese](https://github.com/dapatrese)) at [FORMER 03](https://former03.de/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues.

### Updated default `.htaccess`

We have updated the `.htaccess` that ships with our kits to the new version `2023-07-22`, which adds protection against browser MIME type detection from malicious file uploads for files that have already been copied to the `media` folder. We recommend to update your sites’ `.htaccess` or server configuration with the new changes if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users or if your sites allow file uploads by visitors and the file extensions of uploaded files are not limited to a fixed safe list.

You can find the changes to the `.htaccess` [in this commit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/commit/db49a55c00e7bccea28556a98429130e69ce6184) and read more about the added rules [in the security guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/security#secure-your-server__disable-mime-type-detection).

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for making us aware of this potential attack vector.

### Frame-blocking in the Panel

The Panel now sends the `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` header to increase the protection against clickjacking attacks. The session cookie was already set to `SameSite` before, so this is an additional layer of protection.

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for suggesting this security enhancement.

### Security-related breaking changes

* All users are logged out from their sessions after updating to this patch release.
* The `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) and the `Xml::parse()` method no longer process XML external entities.
* The Panel can no longer be embedded in HTML frames.

## 🎉 Features

* Added Rumanian translation (thanks to [@danburzo](https://github.com/danburzo)) 🎉

## ✨ Enhancements

* Support for variadic controller arguments (thanks to [@lukaskleinschmidt](https://github.com/lukaskleinschmidt)) [#5222](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/5222)
* `collection()` helper (and corresponding methods) allow passing an `$options` array which will be provided as additional arguments to the collection closure (thanks to [@ceesvanegmond](https://github.com/ceesvanegmond))
  ```
  <?php

  // site/controller/news.php
  $articles = collection('news', ['order' => 'asc']);

  // site/collection/news.php
  use Kirby\Cms\Site;

  return function (Site $site, string $order) {
      return $site->find('news')->children()->template('article')->orderBy($order);
  };

## 🚨 Security release

This release fixes several vulnerabilities that were all responsibly reported to us in June 2023:

* [Insufficient Session Expiration after a password change](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-5mvj-rvp8-rf45) (high severity, CVSS score 7.3)
* [Field injection in the KirbyData text storage handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93) (high severity, CVSS score 7.1)
* [XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML data handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp) (medium severity, CVSS score 6.8)
* [Cross-site scripting (XSS) from MIME type auto-detection of uploaded files](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.7)
* [Denial of service from unlimited password lengths](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-3v6j-v3qc-cxff) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.3)

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)), Alexandre Zanni ([@noraj](https://github.com/noraj)) at [ACCEIS](https://www.acceis.fr/) and Patrick Falb ([@dapatrese](https://github.com/dapatrese)) at [FORMER 03](https://former03.de/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues.

### Updated default `.htaccess`

We have updated the `.htaccess` that ships with our kits to the new version `2023-07-22`, which adds protection against browser MIME type detection from malicious file uploads for files that have already been copied to the `media` folder. We recommend to update your sites’ `.htaccess` or server configuration with the new changes if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users or if your sites allow file uploads by visitors and the file extensions of uploaded files are not limited to a fixed safe list.

You can find the changes to the `.htaccess` [in this commit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/commit/db49a55c00e7bccea28556a98429130e69ce6184) and read more about the added rules [in the security guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/security#secure-your-server__disable-mime-type-detection).

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for making us aware of this potential attack vector.

### Frame-blocking in the Panel

The Panel now sends the `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` header to increase the protection against clickjacking attacks. The session cookie was already set to `SameSite` before, so this is an additional layer of protection.

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for suggesting this security enhancement.

### Security-related breaking changes

* All users are logged out from their sessions after updating to this patch release.
* The `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) and the `Xml::parse()` method no longer process XML external entities.
* The Panel can no longer be embedded in HTML frames.

# Insufficient Session Expiration after a password change

High

[bastianallgeier](/bastianallgeier)
published
GHSA-5mvj-rvp8-rf45
Jul 27, 2023

## Package

composer

getkirby/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=3.5.8.2, 3.6.0-3.6.6.2, 3.7.0-3.7.5.1, 3.8.0-3.8.4, 3.9.0-3.9.5

## Patched versions

3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, 3.9.6

## Description

### TL;DR

This vulnerability affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config).

It can only be abused if a Kirby user is logged in on a device or browser that is shared with potentially untrusted users or if an attacker already maliciously used a previous password to log in to a Kirby site as the affected user.

---

### Introduction

Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.

In the variation described in this advisory, it allows attackers to stay logged in to a Kirby site on another device or browser even if the logged in user has since changed their password.

### Impact

Kirby did not invalidate old user sessions after the user password was changed by the user or by a site admin.

If a user changed their password to lock out an attacker who was already in possession of the previous password or of a login session on another device or browser, the attacker would not be reliably prevented from accessing the Kirby site as the affected user.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in [Kirby 3.5.8.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3), [Kirby 3.6.6.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3), [Kirby 3.7.5.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2), [Kirby 3.8.4.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1) and [Kirby 3.9.6](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6). Please update to one of these or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases) to fix the vulnerability.

In all of the mentioned releases, we have updated the authentication implementation to keep track of the last time the password was changed. If a new password was set since the login, the session is invalidated. To enforce this fix even if the vulnerability was previously abused, all users are logged out from the Kirby site after updating to one of the patched releases.

## 🚨 Security release

This release fixes several vulnerabilities that were all responsibly reported to us in June 2023:

* [Insufficient Session Expiration after a password change](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-5mvj-rvp8-rf45) (high severity, CVSS score 7.3)
* [Field injection in the KirbyData text storage handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93) (high severity, CVSS score 7.1)
* [XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML data handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp) (medium severity, CVSS score 6.8)
* [Cross-site scripting (XSS) from MIME type auto-detection of uploaded files](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.7)
* [Denial of service from unlimited password lengths](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-3v6j-v3qc-cxff) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.3)

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)), Alexandre Zanni ([@noraj](https://github.com/noraj)) at [ACCEIS](https://www.acceis.fr/) and Patrick Falb ([@dapatrese](https://github.com/dapatrese)) at [FORMER 03](https://former03.de/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues.

### Updated default `.htaccess`

We have updated the `.htaccess` that ships with our kits to the new version `2023-07-22`, which adds protection against browser MIME type detection from malicious file uploads for files that have already been copied to the `media` folder. We recommend to update your sites’ `.htaccess` or server configuration with the new changes if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users or if your sites allow file uploads by visitors and the file extensions of uploaded files are not limited to a fixed safe list.

You can find the changes to the `.htaccess` [in this commit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/commit/db49a55c00e7bccea28556a98429130e69ce6184) and read more about the added rules [in the security guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/security#secure-your-server__disable-mime-type-detection).

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for making us aware of this potential attack vector.

### Frame-blocking in the Panel

The Panel now sends the `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` header to increase the protection against clickjacking attacks. The session cookie was already set to `SameSite` before, so this is an additional layer of protection.

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for suggesting this security enhancement.

### Security-related breaking changes

* All users are logged out from their sessions after updating to this patch release.
* The `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) and the `Xml::parse()` method no longer process XML external entities.
* The Panel can no longer be embedded in HTML frames.
