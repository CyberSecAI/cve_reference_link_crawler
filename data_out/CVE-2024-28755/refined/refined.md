{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The maximum TLS version to be negotiated was not restored to the configured one when an SSL context was reset using the `mbedtls_ssl_session_reset()` API.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect state management during SSL session reset."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could prevent an Mbed TLS server from establishing any TLS 1.3 connection, potentially resulting in a denial of service or forced version downgrade from TLS 1.3 to TLS 1.2.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious client could repeatedly reset the SSL context using the API, preventing the server from establishing TLS 1.3 connections."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TLS connection with a vulnerable Mbed TLS server and be able to send the requests that cause an SSL context reset via `mbedtls_ssl_session_reset()`."
