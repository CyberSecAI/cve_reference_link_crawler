# February 2024 Security Bulletin

This bulletin addresses vulnerabilities that have been resolved in Atlassian self-managed products.

The vulnerabilities reported in this security bulletin include 11 high-severity vulnerabilities which have been fixed in new versions of our products, released in the last month. These vulnerabilities are discovered via our Bug Bounty program, pen-testing processes, and third-party library scans.

To fix all the vulnerabilities impacting your product(s), Atlassian recommends patching your instances to the latest version or one of the Fixed Versions for each product below. The listed Fixed Versions for each product are current as of Feb. 20, 2024 (date of publication); visit the linked product Release Notes for the most up-to-date versions.

**NOTE**: The vulnerabilities included in monthly Security Bulletins present a lower impact than those published via Critical Security Advisories. Customers can expect to receive those high-priority patches outside of our monthly schedule as necessary.

To search for CVEs or check your product versions for disclosed vulnerabilities, check the [Vulnerability Disclosure Portal.](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/data-protection/vulnerabilities)
