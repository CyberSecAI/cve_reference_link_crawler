## Description

![@dayn1ne](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1087660?v=4&size=48)[dayn1ne](https://github.com/dayn1ne)opened [on Jul 15, 2019](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/2335#issue-468159821)

**Description**

Current version of Firefly III Version 4.7.17 is vulnerable to stored XSS due to lack of filtration of user-supplied data in budget name. Malicious attacker can create specially crafted link, which contains javascript code and assign it to budget name. User who add transactions with malicious budget, can view page with that transaction on tag summary page ([http://firefly.host/tags/show/$tag\_number$](http://firefly.host/tags/show/%24tag_number%24)), malicious javascript code will be executed.

**Steps to reproduce**

I create a small video for reproduce steps
