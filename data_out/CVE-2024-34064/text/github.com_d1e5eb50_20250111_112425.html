# Jinja vulnerable to HTML attribute injection when passing user input as keys to xmlattr filter

Moderate

[davidism](/davidism)
published
GHSA-h75v-3vvj-5mfj
May 5, 2024

## Package

pip

Jinja2
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.1.4

## Patched versions

3.1.4

## Description

The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for the previous [GHSA-h5c8-rqwp-cp95](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h5c8-rqwp-cp95 "GHSA-h5c8-rqwp-cp95") [CVE-2024-22195](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h5c8-rqwp-cp95 "CVE-2024-22195") only addressed spaces but not other characters.

Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting *values* as user input continues to be safe.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
