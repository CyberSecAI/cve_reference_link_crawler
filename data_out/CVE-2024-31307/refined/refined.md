Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a "broken access control issue" within the Easy Social Share Buttons plugin for WordPress. This indicates a lack of proper authorization checks or nonce verification in a function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the absence of necessary authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function that should have them. This lack of access control allows users with lower privileges to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is described as "moderately dangerous and expected to become exploited." This suggests that successful exploitation could lead to significant compromise of the affected WordPress site, although the specific impact will vary depending on the case.
- The patchstack description mentions "an unprivileged user to executing a certain higher privileged action"

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves exploiting the vulnerable function due to the broken access control.
- The attacker can be a 'subscriber' with lower privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A user with a "Subscriber" role within the WordPress site is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability. This indicates a low barrier to entry for an attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity with a CVSS score of 6.3.
- The vulnerable versions are <= 9.4, and the issue is fixed in version 9.5.
- Patchstack has released a virtual patch to mitigate this issue until the plugin is updated.
