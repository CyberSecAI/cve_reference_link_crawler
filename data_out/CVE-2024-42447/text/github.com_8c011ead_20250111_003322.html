Unfortunately version check on auh manager for logout CSRF protection assumed that the fix to CSRF protection will be merged in 2.9.3, but it was not, so we have to bump the minimum version it is supported to 2.10.0.

| Wouldn't this simply call for 2.9.3 rc2?  See the comment in VOTING thread - I am ok with either, but I don't think that one is important enough to call for 2.9.3 rc2 |
