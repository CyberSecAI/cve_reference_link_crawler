- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the ConacWin web interface, specifically within the handling of the `xml` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted SQL query sent to the `xml` parameter of the ConacWin web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker with access to the ConacWin web interface is required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's web interface. The attacker must have low privileges (PR:L) for exploitation.
