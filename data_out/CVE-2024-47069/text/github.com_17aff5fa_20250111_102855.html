## Description

## usd-2024-0009 | Reflected XSS in Oveleon Cookiebar

### Details

**Advisory ID**: usd-2024-0009

**Product**: Cookiebar

**Affected Version**: 2.X

**Vulnerability Type**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

**Security Risk**: HIGH, CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N

**Vendor URL**: <https://www.usd.de/>

**Vendor acknowledged vulnerability**: Yes

**Vendor Status**: Fixed

**CVE Number**: Not requested yet

**CVE Link**: Not requested yet

**First Published**: Published

**Last Update**: 2024-07-29

### Affected Component

The `block` function in `CookiebarController.php`.

### Desciption

Oveleon's Cookiebar is an extension for the popular Contao CMS.

The `block/locale` endpoint does not properly sanitize the user-controlled `locale` input before including it in the backend's HTTP response, thereby causing reflected XSS.

### Proof of Concept

The vulnerability could be triggered by entering the following Link:

```
https://[redacted].de/cookiebar/block/dens82w%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(1)%3Ew9qt
n/[id]?redirect=https%3A%2F%2F[...]amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D3%26amp%3Bmo
destbranding%3D1%26amp%3Brel%3D0

```

It is likely related to the following function in the Oveleon Cookiebar source code:

```
    /**
     * Block content
     *
     * @Route("/cookiebar/block/{locale}/{id}", name="cookiebar_block")
     */
    public function block(Request $request, string $locale, int $id): Response
    {
        System::loadLanguageFile('tl_cookiebar', $locale);

        $this->framework->initialize();

        $objCookie = CookieModel::findById($id);

        if (null === $objCookie || null === $request->headers->get('referer'))
        {
            throw new PageNotFoundException();
        }

        $strUrl = $request->get('redirect');

        // Protect against XSS attacks
        if(!Validator::isUrl($strUrl))
        {
            return new Response('The redirect destination must be a valid URL.', Response::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);
        }

        $objTemplate = new FrontendTemplate($objCookie->blockTemplate ?: 'ccb_element_blocker');

        $objTemplate->language = $locale;
        $objTemplate->id = $objCookie->id;
        $objTemplate->title = $objCookie->title;
        $objTemplate->type = $objCookie->type;
        $objTemplate->iframeType = $objCookie->iframeType;
        $objTemplate->description = $objCookie->blockDescription;
        $objTemplate->redirect = $request->get('redirect');
        $objTemplate->acceptAndDisplayLabel = $this->translator->trans('tl_cookiebar.acceptAndDisplayLabel', [], 'contao_default', $locale);

        return $objTemplate->getResponse();
    }
```
### Fix

Sanitize the `locale` input to prevent XSS payloads from being executed in a user's browser.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
