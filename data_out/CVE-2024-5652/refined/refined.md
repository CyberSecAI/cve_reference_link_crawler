This vulnerability was discovered by Hashim Jawad ([@ihack4falafel](https://github.com/ihack4falafel)) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.\"",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause is related to the `exec-path` Docker daemon config option in Windows containers mode which allows users in the `docker-users` group to trigger a denial of service (DoS).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary weakness is the insecure handling of the `exec-path` Docker daemon config option, which can be exploited by members of the `docker-users` group to cause a denial of service condition."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is a Denial-of-Service (DoS), preventing normal operation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves exploiting the `exec-path` Docker daemon config option when Docker is running in Windows containers mode."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be a member of the `docker-users` group to exploit the vulnerability."
