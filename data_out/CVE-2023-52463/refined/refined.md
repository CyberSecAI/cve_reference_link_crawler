```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The efivarfs filesystem does not check permissions when remounted, leading to a crash if the firmware does not support SetVariable at runtime and the filesystem is remounted as RW.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper permission check",
    "Null pointer dereference"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Kernel crash, denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remounting the efivarfs filesystem as RW when the firmware doesn't support SetVariable at runtime, then attempting to write to it using a tool like efi-updatevar.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to remount the efivarfs filesystem and use efi-updatevar, which typically requires root access."
