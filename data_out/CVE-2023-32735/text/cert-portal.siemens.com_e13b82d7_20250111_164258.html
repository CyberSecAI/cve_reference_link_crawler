SSA-779936: Catalog-Profile Deserialization Vulnerability in Siemens Engineering Platforms before V19

| Publication Date: | 2024-07-09 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-07-09 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 6.5 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.0 |

SUMMARY

Affected applications do not properly restrict the .NET BinaryFormatter when deserializing user-controllable input. This could allow an attacker to cause a type confusion and execute arbitrary code within the affected application.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.
