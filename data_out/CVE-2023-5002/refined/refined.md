Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5002:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The pgAdmin server includes an HTTP API that validates the path to external PostgreSQL utilities (like `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`). This API executes the specified utility to determine its PostgreSQL version.
*   Prior to version 7.7, pgAdmin failed to properly control the server code executed by this API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Authenticated users can inject arbitrary commands into the path validator through the API.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The API did not properly sanitize or validate the provided paths to external PostgreSQL utilities.
*   **Uncontrolled Server Code Execution:** The server code executed via the API was not adequately controlled, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An authenticated user can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the pgAdmin server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the pgAdmin process.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the pgAdmin server.
*   The attacker crafts a malicious path containing shell commands and submits it to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have valid authentication credentials for the pgAdmin server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the pgAdmin server's HTTP API.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is not exploitable for users running pgAdmin in desktop mode.
*   The issue was fixed in pgAdmin version 7.7.
*   Patches have been backported to older versions of pgAdmin in Fedora.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Stefan Gr√∂nke from Radically Open Security.
