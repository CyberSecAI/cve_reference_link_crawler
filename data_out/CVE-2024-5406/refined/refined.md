**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL or web request with the vulnerable parameters and tricks an authenticated user into accessing it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL or web request to a victim.
*   The victim needs to be an authenticated user of the WinNMP application and needs to be tricked into accessing the malicious URL or web request.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in WinNMP version 19.02
*   The provided CVSS score is 6.3, which is considered medium severity.
*   The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning the user must perform some action (like clicking a link).
