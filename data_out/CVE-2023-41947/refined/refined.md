Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41947:

**CVE-2023-41947:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Frugal Testing Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing permission check vulnerability and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to Frugal Testing using attacker-specified username and password.
    *   Attackers can retrieve test IDs and names from Frugal Testing if a valid credential corresponds to the attacker-specified username.
    *   Attackers can perform actions via CSRF due to missing POST request enforcement
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks through HTTP endpoints.
    *   CSRF attacks are possible
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker can trigger a CSRF attack by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link.

**Summary:**

The Frugal Testing Plugin lacks proper permission checks and CSRF protection in its HTTP endpoints. This allows an attacker with Overall/Read permission to connect to Frugal Testing with attacker-controlled credentials and retrieve test data or perform actions via CSRF.
