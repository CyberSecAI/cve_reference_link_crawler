{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `BlacklistUrlFilter` and `WhitelistUrlFilter` in Alpine use the `startsWith` method for URL filtering. This approach does not normalize the request URI, allowing for bypasses using sequences like `/allowed/..;/blocked` which are later resolved to `/blocked` by the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Access control bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Access control bypasses, potentially leading to source code leaks when protecting application code on executable WAR files.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a URL containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `/foo/..;/secret/secret.txt`) to bypass URL filters.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
