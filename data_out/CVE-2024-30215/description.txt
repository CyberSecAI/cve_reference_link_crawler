The Resource Settings page allows a high privilege attacker to load exploitable payload to be stored and reflected whenever a User visits the page. In a successful attack, some information could be obtained and/or modified. However,Â the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited.
