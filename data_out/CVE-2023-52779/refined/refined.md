The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52779.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `vfs_getattr_nosec()` interacts with the filesystem's `getattr` interface function within the Linux kernel. When `vfs_getattr_nosec()` is called, it should propagate the 'nosec' flag to avoid unnecessary security checks. However, due to a recent change, `vfs_getattr_nosec()` could end up calling `vfs_getattr()`, which includes a call to `security_inode_getattr()`. This call could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the process is exiting and does not have `current->fs` set anymore.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper propagation of the `nosec` flag in `vfs_getattr_nosec()`.
- Potential for a NULL pointer dereference in `security_inode_getattr()` when called on an exiting process without `current->fs` set.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, which could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) by causing a kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack involves triggering the vulnerable code path through a specific sequence of calls related to file system operations, specifically when IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) uses `vfs_getattr_nosec()`. The specific sequence that triggers the vulnerability involves using overlayfs, with an exiting process involved in the operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to trigger file system operations in a way that calls the vulnerable code path and specifically involves an exiting process that does not have `current->fs` set. This typically requires some control or knowledge of file system interactions.
