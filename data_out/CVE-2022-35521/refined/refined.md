The provided content describes multiple command injection vulnerabilities in WAVLINK routers. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary cause is the lack of input validation and sanitization in multiple CGI scripts (adm.cgi, api.cgi, firewall.cgi, login.cgi, nas.cgi, qos.cgi, and wireless.cgi) of WAVLINK router firmware. Specifically, several parameters are vulnerable to command injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** The identified weakness is the direct use of user-supplied data in shell commands without proper filtering or escaping.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the router's operating system, potentially leading to complete control over the device. This can result in:
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware installation
    *   Denial of service
    *   Network manipulation
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific CGI endpoints of the router.
    *   The attacker injects malicious shell commands within vulnerable parameters.
    *   This can be done via crafted POST requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.
    *   Login is required for most of the mentioned vulnerabilities, except for `/login.shtml`.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.
