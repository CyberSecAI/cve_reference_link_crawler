Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3018

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of untrusted data within the "Login | Register Form" widget in the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin. Specifically, the plugin was using `maybe_unserialize` on data stored in the `eael_resetpassword_error_{widget_id}` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The plugin deserializes data retrieved from the database without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious PHP object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain is present, this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Data Retrieval:** An attacker could potentially retrieve sensitive data stored within the application.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** It might be possible for an attacker to delete files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'error_resetpassword' attribute of the "Login | Register Form" widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have author-level access or higher to exploit the vulnerability.
- **WordPress User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of Essential Addons for Elementor up to and including 5.9.13.
- The fix implemented in version 5.9.14 involves using `json_decode` instead of `maybe_unserialize` to retrieve the data stored in the `eael_resetpassword_error_{widget_id}` option, which prevents object deserialization.
- The "Login | Register Form" widget is disabled by default but can be enabled.
- The vulnerable code is primarily located in the `includes/Elements/Login_Register.php` and `includes/Traits/Login_Registration.php` files.
