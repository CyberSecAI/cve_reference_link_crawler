# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Miniflare

High

[mskowroncf](/mskowroncf)
published
GHSA-fwvg-2739-22v7
Dec 29, 2023

## Package

npm

miniflare
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 3.20230821.0, < 3.20231030.2

## Patched versions

3.20231030.2

## Description

### Impact

Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in `wrangler` until `3.19.0`), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.

### Patches

The issue was fixed in `miniflare@3.20231030.2`.

### Workarounds

Ensure Miniflare is configured to listen on just local interfaces. This is the default behaviour, but can also be configured with the `host: "127.0.0.1"` option.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @mrbbot **[mrbbot](/mrbbot)** commented [Nov 30, 2023](#issue-2019147648)

Fixes [#4239](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/4239).

**What this PR solves / how to test:**

Previously, Wrangler listened on all interfaces (`*`) by default. This change switches `wrangler (pages) dev` to just listen on local interfaces. Whilst this is technically a breaking change, we've decided the security benefits outweigh the potential disruption caused. If you need to access your dev server from another device on your network, you can use `wrangler (pages) dev --ip *` to restore the previous behaviour. To test, run `wrangler dev` and `lsof -nPiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN`. Observe Wrangler isn't listening on all interfaces.
