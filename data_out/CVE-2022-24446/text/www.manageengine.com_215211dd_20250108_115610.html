### Key Manager Plus 6680 (Minor) (August 2024)

**New Feature**

* **GlobalSign Managed SSL**

  Key Manager Plus now supports GlobalSign's managed SSL services, revolutionizing the SSL certificate procurement process by utilizing pre-vetted domains to bypass traditional domain validation. This enhancement significantly accelerates certificate issuance, drastically reducing the time and effort required to procure SSL certificates for pre-vetted domains. By leveraging MSSL's pre-vetted domains, organizations can streamline their SSL management process, ensuring faster, more efficient, and hassle-free certificate procurement.

**Enhancements**

* Using the multiple server deployment type, certificates can now be deployed to the Microsoft Certificate Stores of agents using the From File option with a list of installed agents.
* From this build onwards, SSL certificates can be discovered from the Microsoft Certificate Stores of agents using the From File option with a list of installed agents during the regular discovery process or MS Certificate Store Discovery schedule.
* Earlier, the Key Manager Plus agent should have been directly installed in the Microsoft Certificate Authority server to perform the SSL-based operations from Key Manager Plus. From now on, it is sufficient to install the Key Manager Plus agent on any server, provided the server has access to connect to the MSCA server.
* We have introduced the Email field on the CSR creation form.
* Users can now import SSH keys in bulk, provided the keys are passwordless or share the same passphrase.
* SSH keys can now be created with rsa-sha-256 and rsa-sha-512 key types.
* SSH keys can now be exported as either a public key or a private key as required.
* Key Manager Plus can now parse version 3 PuTTY Private Keys.
* We have added a consent checkbox in the SDP and MDM configuration for accessing the LAN to connect to the services/servers running on the LAN.
* As a best practice and preventive security measure, we have disabled the autofill and password settings for the Key Manager Plus application login.
* Henceforth, the certificates' serial number details will be available for the certificates managed in the Certificate Authority - The SSL Store.

**Bug Fixes**

* Previously, the sync check status for SSL certificates deployed on servers via the Key Manager Plus agent was not functioning correctly in the multiple server window. This issue has now been resolved.
* Deploying certificates to the Microsoft Certificate Store using the Agent deployment type failed when the KeyStore password was blank. This issue has been fixed.
* In some instances, empty reports were generated during AWS discovery schedules or AWS certificate reports generation, even without active AWS credentials. This issue has now been resolved.
* An issue that affected the modification of schedules created with the SSL Discovery schedule type, using the discovery method From File, has been identified and fixed.
* When creating an Entrust certificate order using the Select CSR method, selecting a CSR with the KeyStore type set to KEY caused the certificate order to fail in the Key Manager Plus portal despite being created in the Entrust portal. This issue has now been fixed.
* When a certificate imported through an existing GlobalSign order is deleted from the SSL tab, the certificate order remains linked to the user who imports it to the Key Manager Plus repository. If another user attempts to import the existing orders using the identical GlobalSign credentials, they gain access to the certificate of the certificate order associated with the prior user. This issue has now been fixed.
* Previously, importing the existing orders from DigiCert failed, for instance, having more than 1000 orders. This issue has now been fixed.
* An issue that led to the failure of the Failover Service configuration has been found and fixed.

**Security Fix**

* We have added a few fixes for the prevention of Server Side Request Forgery and the usage of the static variable.

* Users can now seamlessly export certificates in a certificate group as a Truststore with a secured Truststore password.
* Users can now view the key usage and extended key usage parameters associated with an SSL certificate during its creation on the Certificate Details Page.
* From now onwards, the SSL certificate expiry information received through SSL certificate expiry notifications or SSL expiry schedules will be organized with the nearest expiry date.

**Bug Fixes**

* Previously, when an administrator disabled the user password field in the Export Settings, it impacted all users and prevented them from exporting data with a custom password. Key Manager Plus now enables administrators to disable the custom export password option for themselves without affecting other users.
* Previously, separating the SSL certificate description by lines caused data misalignment and broken lines in the CSV file during export. This issue has now been resolved.
* An issue that prevented users from importing and associating a private key (created without DES encryption in OpenSSL) with an existing SSL certificate in the repository has been identified and resolved.
* Previously, when editing a schedule for the SSL Certificate Report that included certificate groups, the certificate group details were not displayed on the edit schedule page. This issue has now been resolved.
* An issue that prevented users from updating additional fields for certificate groups created using the criteria 'Issuer' and 'AWS Services' has been identified and resolved
* Previously, SSL power users with multiple certificate groups could only update additional fields for all groups collectively, not individually. This issue has now been resolved.

---

### Key Manager Plus 6671 (HotFix) (May 2024)

* The issue causing duplicate MSCA certificate entries in the SSL tab has been fixed.
* Using the additional field as a criterion for grouping the SSL certificates resulted in an issue with sending expiry notification emails to the specified group emails. This issue has been rectified, ensuring seamless notification delivery.
* Previously, when an additional field was created and used as a criterion for grouping the SSL certificates by an administrator, the SSL expiry email was exclusively dispatched for the certificates owned by the administrator and not for the certificates that are owned by other administrators. This issue has now been mitigated.
* All active and expiring domains are now selectable while creating, renewing, or reissuing an order in Entrust.
* An issue that prevented administrators from viewing the Entrust orders created by other administrators has been fixed.

Kubernetes secrets, a feature provided by the Kubernetes platform, facilitates a secure way of storing Kubernetes TLS secrets (certificates) within Kubernetes clusters.

  The integration aids the administrator in securely fetching the Kubernetes TLS secrets (certificates) into Key Manager Plus, managing them within the single centralized repository, and rotating/updating the secrets obtained from multiple Kubernetes clusters.

  Navigate to 'SSL >> Kubernetes' to configure and manage all your Kubernetes TLS secrets (certificates) via Key Manager Plus.

* **New User Role - SSL Power User**

  We have introduced a new static custom role - SSL Power User. Users designated with this role will have elevated privileges to perform complete SSL certificate management capabilities.

**Enhancements**

* As a part of this release, Digicert is added as a vendor to the SSL Store list. The previously available SSL Store vendors, which include Thawte, Geo Trust, and Rapid SSL, will now be a part of Digicert.
* It is now possible to add an email address while configuring 'Certificate Sync Status Check' from 'Settings >> SSL >> Certificate Sync Status'. Once added with the configured recurrence time interval, the list of all the SSL certificates with their deployed servers will be sent to the given email address, with the following details: days to expire, date of expiry, serial number, and fingerprint.
* Henceforth, while creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), only the Common Name, Validity, and Store Password will be the mandatory fields.
* We have added the following additional key sizes to the key algorithms for increased security strength:
  + 3072 and 4096 key sizes for RSA
  + 2048 and 3072 key sizes for DSA
* Key Manager Plus now supports SHA256 SSL fingerprint to encrypt the SSL certificates. Administrator can navigate to 'Settings >> SSL >> SSL Fingerprint' to change their SHA values. All the existing certificates can also be changed to SHA256 fingerprint by enabling the checkbox provided.
* From now on, the dashboard on the Key Manager Plus homepage will not consider the EC certificate key size into account for the 1024-bit and lesser keys calculation.

**Bug Fix**

* Previously, when an administrator tried to rediscover the certificates in an organization, it failed with an empty error message. This issue has now been fixed.

**Security Fixes**

* A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability reported on the SSH server by passing malicious links has been fixed.
* An issue that allowed the users with the Operator role to access the server with the pre-opened terminal even after revoking the permission has been found and fixed.
* A stored XSS vulnerability caused by an image uploaded during the rebranding of Key Manager Plus has been found and fixed.

### Key Manager Plus Release 6450 (Feb 2023)

**New Features**

* **SMTP OAuth Authentication**

  Key Manager Plus now supports OAuth authentication for SMTP-based email communications to provide a secure channel for outbound emails from Key Manager Plus. With this, users can configure OAuth from Google or Microsoft Exchange Service as their mail server to send email notifications from Key Manager Plus. This process eliminates the need for the users to provide account credentials to authenticate the notification emails.
* **Server Certificates in Centralized Repository**

  Users can now maintain server certificates in the Key Manager Plus' centralized SSL repository without affecting the available number of keys in the license.
* **FortiGate Firewall Discovery and Deployment**

  Using Key Manager Plus, users will now be able to discover certificates from the FortiGate Firewalls. Users can also add and manage multiple FortiGate Firewall accounts and deploy certificates to them individually.

**Enhancements**

* A new option provided under **'SSL >> Certificates >> Multiple Servers'** allows users to add additional fields, such as character, date, and email, in the Multiple Servers page.
* **New REST API:** In this release, we have added a new REST API - Import CSR, to import the [Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](https://www.manageengine.com/key-manager/information-center/what-is-certificate-signing-request.html?relnotes "Certificate Signing Request (CSR)") by providing valid information.
* It is now possible to include the multiple server lists of the SSL certificates in the notification email of the SSL expiry schedule.

**Bug Fixes**

* Previously, the SSH and SSL discovery (including scheduled discovery) results included the IP address(es) provided in the 'Exclude IPAddress' field. This issue has now been fixed.
* Earlier, the certificate requests raised by a user was accessible to all other users with the operator role. From now on, the certificate requests will be accessible only to the administrators, apart from the users who created them.
* In the notification policy, email notifications pre-configured by administrators for the certification expiry, were sent at configured intervals without the subject or details. This issue has been fixed now.
* Previously, the IP and the DNS fields had similar entries when an IP was not resolved into DNS, thus creating duplicate entries on the multiple server page. We have fixed this issue now.
* In the notification policy, email notifications pre-configured by administrators for the expiry of PGP keys, were sent at configured intervals without the subject or details, even when no PGP keys were present. This issue has now been fixed.
* Earlier, in addition to the latest version, .Net Framework version 3.5 was required for IIS binding. From now on, any .Net Framework version above 4 will be sufficient to bind a certificate to a website in IIS.
* Previously, adding or updating the schedules used the client machine's date instead of the server's. We have fixed it now in this release.
* An issue that led the SSL discovery to fail with an exception message - 'certificates do not conform to algorithm constraint' has been fixed.
* There was an issue fetching some columns from the ServiceNow help desk that appear under 'Settings >> Ticketing system'. This issue has been fixed now.

### Key Manager Plus Release 5910 (May 2020)

**New Features**

* **New Certificate Format - PEM**

  A new certificate format, Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), has been added, in addition to the already available certificate export formats, Keystore and PFX, where the PEM format is used for digital certificates and keys, deployed in web server platforms (e.g., Apache).
* **Support for GoDaddy DNS**

  From now on, Key Manager Plus supports GoDaddy DNS to complete the domain control validation procedure while acquiring certificates from public Certificate Authorities, along with the already available DNS support types, Azure DNS, Cloudflare DNS, Amazon route 53, and RFC2136 Update. Using GoDaddy DNS, users can update the DNS record for GoDaddy domain validation from the Key Manager Plus portal itself.

**Enhancements**

* This release comes with an exclusive page for 'Windows Agents', accessible from the SSL tab, from where users will be able to perform all agent-specific operations such as SSL Discovery using agent, deployment of SSL certificates in certificate groups using agent and CSR Signing with MSCA agent.
* Certificate deployment in multiple servers has now been made simpler by using an agent, provided the agent is running in the server to be deployed, and both the agent name and the server DNS name are the same.
* Now, auto-renewal of certificates is possible for the 'MSCA using agent' sign type as well, from 'Settings >> SSL >> Certificate Renewal'.
* The 'Certificate Sign Report' comes with the following MSCA/Third party CA signing details; Certificate Authority, Certificate Template, Sign Type column.
* The 'Certificate Renewal report' comes with the 'Renewed By' column relevant to MSCA and 3rdPartyCA renewal details.
* A new option 'Reissue Certificate' has been added under 'SSL >> GlobalSign' that allows users to request GlobalSign to reissue an SSL certificate.

### Key Manager Plus Release 5900 (March 2020)

**New Feature**

* **GlobalSign**

  Key Manager Plus now supports integration with GlobalSign SSL—atrusted certificate authority and a leading cloud-based PKI solutions provider. This integration enables users to request, acquire, import, deploy, renew and automate the end-to-end lifecycle management of SSL/TLS certificates issued by GlobalSign, directly from the Key Manager Plus web interface.
* **Certificate Deployment using Agent**

  Key Manager Plus can already deploy and bind certificates to IIS servers belonging to the domain, where Key Manager Plus also resides. Now, Key Manager Plus can also deploy certificates to IIS servers in demilitarized zones and also bind them to websites in IIS, all using an agent. This makes Key Manager Plus more scalable, as it can deploy and bind certificates in IIS servers, irrespective of whether they are in the same or different domain.
* **CSR Signing using Agent**

  In addition to the already available two sign types namely, 'MS Certificate Authority' and 'Sign with Root', used to sign certificates from Key Manager Plus, a third sign type 'MS Certificate Authority with Agent' has been introduced. This new sign type is mainly used to sign certificates originating from a distinct domain, i.e., other than the domain to which Key Manager Plus belongs.
* **System Integration - ServiceDesk Plus and Service Now**

  From release 5900, Key Manager Plus integrates with enterprise ticketing systems namely ServiceDesk Plus (on-premise) and ServiceNow. This integration ensures that automatic service requests are created in the ticketing environment to notify administrators of SSL certificates that are at the risk of expiring and certificates that are deemed vulnerable after a vulnerability scan in Key Manager Plus. Users can set notification policies to govern the frequency of service request creation for expiring and vulnerable tickets.

**Enhancements**

* It is now possible to customize notifications and their intervals. Users can now choose not to receive notifications regarding the expired certificates, and send a separate email and customized subject per certificate, from **'Settings >> Notification'**. The same actions can be done while creating new schedules under **'Schedule >> Add Schedule'**, where you have to select the Schedule Type as 'SSL Expiry'.
* It is now possible to bulk edit the additional fields for multiple SSH keys and certificates.
* The column chooser was introduced in the version 5850 in the SSL window. Now, the IP address and Port are added in the column chooser which allows the users to display the selected columns in the list view.
* It is now possible to provide ephemeral access (validity in hours and minutes) to certificates created using the 'Create Certificate' Rest API.
* Earlier, Key Manager Plus allowed signing and deployment of certificates only from Windows systems. Now, it is possible to perform certificate signing and deployment to Windows systems from Linux installations through agents.
* It is now possible to provide customized subjects in schedules.

**Security Enhancement**

Earlier, PostgreSQL data directories in Windows installations were entirely accessible to all locally authenticated users. Now, as a security practice, we have exerted the following measures, applicable for installations under the 'Program Files' directory:

* No inherited permissions are allowed for data and configurations directories
* **"Authenticated Users"** permission has been excluded entirely

Only the CREATOR OWNER, SYSTEM, Installation User, NT AUTHORITY\Network Service and Administrators groups will have the Full Control over the directories and also can start PostgreSQL.

### Key Manager Plus Release 5860 (January 2020)

**New Feature**

* **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Keys**

  PGP encryption is used to enhance cryptographic privacy and authentication for online communication by encrypting and decrypting texts, emails, files, etc. It uses a combination of data compression, hashing, and public-key cryptography to boost confidentiality. Now, Key Manager Plus brings you this PGP functionality in the form of PGP key generation, where the keys are used to encrypt the data like emails, texts, etc. Create, store and manage PGP keys under 'KMP >> Key Store >> PGP Keys'. Modify the key description anytime, export private/public keys, export keys to multiple email ids, and generate, view, and schedule reports. You can also send expiry notification emails to admins. This feature allows you to share and collaborate information securely among your trusted groups of users and businesses.

---

### Key Manager Plus Release 5850 (December 2019)

**New Features**

* **SSL Certificate Deployment and Binding - IIS Server**

  From release 5850, you can both deploy a certificate to the IIS server and also bind it to the desired website in the IIS, all from the Key Manager Plus interface itself, without the need to access the IIS server separately. Also, an option has been provided to automatically restart the IIS server for the deployment and binding to take effect, thereby eliminating the need for the manual restart from the IIS end.
* **Additional Fields**

  Key Manager Plus now brings you the 'Additional Fields' feature, configured from 'Settings >> General Settings' that is used to include any additional information about SSH keys and SSL certificates, stored in the repository. There are four different categories to add the additional fields: character, numeric, date and email. Users can choose to add or remove the additional fields from SSH and SSL views.
* **Column Chooser**

  The 5850 version of Key Manager Plus comes with the Column Chooser feature that allows users to show or hide columns at runtime, and also rearrange the columns from the current view via drag-and-drop.

**Enhancements**

* Now, it is possible to use the Key Manager Plus service account credentials for authentication while deploying certificates in Windows servers.
* Henceforth, while creating a certificate, users can provide ephemeral access (validity in hours and minutes) to the certificate, after which the certificate auto-expires. This eliminates the need for compulsory permanent access credentials to access target systems and also explicit access repeal.
* It is now possible to perform SNI-based SSL discovery using the Common Name and IP Address combination.
* The option to filter certificates based on the key length and signature algorithm within specific expiry days has been added to the 'getAllSSLCertificates' Rest API.

**Bug Fixes**

* During all AD-related operations performed from the Key Manager Plus interface, the 'Connection Mode' got saved as 'No SSL' only, even if the 'SSL' mode was chosen. This issue has been fixed now.
* Earlier, MSCA signing supported 'java keytool' CSR only. Now, from this release, all CSRs will be supported by MSCA signing.
* During certificate creation, all values entered in the SAN field were all together categorized as 'DNS' only. Now, the values are segregated as 'DNS' and 'IP Address' categories.

### Key Manager Plus - Release 4.0 (June, 2016)

**New Features**

* **SSL Certificate Management**- Key Manager Plus provides visibility and centralized control over the entire life cycle of SSL certificates across any network and thereby helps prevent downtime, compliance issues, and security breaches.

  Highlights of SSL certificate management include:

  + **Discovery**: Discovers all SSL certificates deployed in the network, irrespective of the issuing certificate authority (CA), including self-signed ones.
  + **Centralized Inventory**: Consolidates all discovered certificates and stores them in a secure, centralized repository for easy access and management.
  + **Track Certificate Details**: Tracks all certificate information, including name of the CA, date of issue, encryption algorithm, key length and other vital details.
  + **Control Certificate Signing Requests**: Centrally controls new CSR process. Handles key-pair creation process and provides ready-to-use CSR data files to be sent to the CA for getting new certificates.
  + **Expiration Alerts**: Tracks certificate validity and sends alerts about the certificates that are about to expire. Generates reports on expiry status of certificates.
  + **Flag SHA-1 Certificates**: Identifies certificates that use SHA-1 hashing function (which is found to be weak), prompting administrators to revoke the certificates and create new ones.
  + **Ensure Compliance**: Ensures that the encryption algorithms and underlying key lengths comply with various industry regulations.

* **Key Store**- Key Manager Plus provides a secure repository for the storage of any digital key.

  Using the Key Store feature of Key Manager Plus, you can:

  + Add any digital key file (< 1MB) to the Key Manager Plus repository.
  + Map the digital key to a particular application, instance, and location (i.e, AWS, Azure data centers etc), to easily locate, track, and maintain them.
  + Maintain versions of the digital key files.
  + Generate report of all digital keys in use along with their details.

**Enhancements**

* Earlier, for SSH key management, user accounts could be added only if their associated credentials were provided. Now, a feature has been added to manage users using only SSH key pairs (without providing their passwords).
* **SSH Private Key Group** : This enhancement helps to organize SSH private keys as a logical group and execute key rotation, report creation, key group deployment and other operations in bulk.
* **SSH User Group** : This enhancement helps to organize SSH users into a group and execute actions in bulk on the group.
* Earlier, the private keys were deployed in the default location. Now, option has been provided to change the remote server user account authorized\_key file location (i.e /home/test/.ssh to var/home/test/.ssh) both in bulk and for individual user accounts.
* Support is now provided for JUNOS based Juniper devices.

**Changes**

* Earlier, licensing was based on the number of SSH users. Henceforth, licensing would be based on the number of keys, which includes SSH private keys, SSL certificates, and the number of keys in the Key Store, which are managed using Key Manager Plus.

### Instructions to apply the Upgrade Pack

**IMPORTANT**: Take a copy of the entire Key Manager Plus installation folder before applying the upgrade pack and keep it in some other location. If something goes wrong with the Key Manager Plus upgrade, you can rely on the copy. Also ensure that you stop the Key Manager Plus server before applying the upgrade pack. All your settings will remain intact.

### Windows

* Stop the Key Manager Plus service. Take a backup of the entire Key Manager Plus installation folder and store it in some other location. In case something goes wrong with the upgrade, you can revert to this copy, with your settings intact.
* The upgrade pack is to be applied through a tool named UpdateManager bundled with Key Manager Plus. To begin the upgrade, navigate to the **<Key Manager Plus\_Installation\_Folder>/bin** directory and execute the command UpdateManager.bat to start the Update Manager.
![update manager](/key-manager/images/updatemanager-2.png)* Click **Browse** and select the .ppm file that you downloaded. As a part of patch integrity verification from KMP build 6300 onwards, you must import an SSL certificate to complete the upgrade process. Click [here](https://www.manageengine.com/certificate/ppmsigner_publickey.crt) to download the SSL certificate to be imported.
* In the pop-up that opens, click **Browse** and import the SSL certificate you downloaded from the aforementioned page.
![import certificate](/key-manager/images/import-certificate-2.png)* Click **Install** in the Update Manager window to begin the upgrade process. Wait for a few minutes until the upgrade pack is fully installed. Please note that importing the SSL certificate is mandatory while upgrading KMP from version 6.2 to 6.3. However, this is a one-time operation and you need not repeat the process during the next version upgrade.
* Click **Close** and then click **Exit** to exit the Update Manager tool. If you are applying multiple upgrade packs one-by-one, exit the Update Manager tool after applying one upgrade pack and make sure that the database process is not running. Then proceed with running the Update Manager tool to apply the next upgrade pack and so on
* Also, when applying multiple upgrade packs sequentially, it is recommended that you start the Key Manager Plus service after each upgrade to ensure the corresponding build version runs successfully without any issue.

### Linux

Note:

In case you store the **database\_params.conf** file at a different location, you must copy the file back to the original location (i.e. <Key Manager Plus\_Installation\_Folder>/conf/) before performing the upgrade.

* Stop KMP service using the command **/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshkeymanager-service stop.**
* The upgrade pack is to be applied through a tool named **UpdateManager** bundled with Key Manager Plus. To begin the upgrade, navigate to **<Key Manager Plus\_Installation\_Folder>/bin** directory using a terminal.
* Execute the command**sh UpdateManager.sh -c** (This will run the Update Manager in CLI mode)
* Now, press i to install. Supply full path of the upgrade pack.
* As a part of patch integrity verification from KMP build 6300 onwards, you must import an SSL certificate to install the upgrade. Download the certificate from [this](https://www.manageengine.com/certificate/ppmsigner_publickey.crt) link.
* Enter the SSL certificate's absolute path when prompted. Once the certificate is imported successfully, wait for the upgrade to complete until the message "Service Pack applied successfully" is displayed. Please note that the SSL certificate import is a one-time operation and you need not repeat the process during the next version upgrade.
* If you are applying multiple upgrade packs, do the following for each upgrade; exit the Update Manager, start & stop the KMP service once, and execute the upgrade steps.
* After applying the upgrade packs, login as a root user and start the KMP service, using **/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshkeymanager-service start.**

Note:

Please note that importing the SSL certificate is mandatory while upgrading KMP from version 6.2 to 6.3. However, this is a one-time operation and you need not repeat the process during the next version upgrade.

### Failover Service (FOS) Setup

In a failover service set up with two application servers bound to an MS SQL cluster, you can upgrade only the primary server; the secondary server must be reinstalled and the failover service setup must be reconfigured.

Summary of steps to be followed:

* Deactivate the failover service.
* Upgrade the primary application server.
* Reinstall the secondary application.
* Reconfigure the failover service.

### Deactivate Failover Service

You can deactivate the failover service either from the primary or the secondary server.

To uninstall:

* Open a command prompt in any of the servers
* Navigate to <keymanagerplus\_installation\_folder>/**bin** directory
* Execute the command: **UninstallFOS.bat**

With this, the failover service will be deactivated. Next, you can uninstall Key Manager Plus application completely from the other servers.

### Upgrade the Primary Application server

You can upgrade your primary installation of Key Manager Plus by following the below steps. The latest upgrade packs are available [above](#scroll) . You can use the instructions mentioned here to apply the upgrade packs one by one to reach the latest version. If MS SQL is configured as back end, do take a backup of database present in MS SQL Server

Note:

Before upgrading, we recommend you take a backup of the entire Key Manager Plus directory. This will be useful if there are any technical issues causing upgrade failure and you can immediately revert to the existing version by deleting the Key Manager Plus directory and placing the backup directory in the same location to get your Key Manager Plus instance up and running again.

### Upgrade steps

* Stop the Key Manager Plus service and exit the tray icon.
* Navigate to **<Key Manager Plus\_Installation\_Folder>/bin** directory from CMD and execute **UpdateManager.bat**
  + During MS SQL server configuration for Key Manager Plus database, if you have opted for 'Windows Authentication,' you have to start the command prompt using the service account with which the Key Manager Plus service has been configured to connect to the SQL server (i.e. instead of running as administrator, run as the service account).
  + To identify whether a service account is used or a SQL account is used, navigate to **<Key Manager Plus\_Installation\_Folder>/conf** directory and open**database\_params.conf** file. If you do not find a username and password in the file, then Key Manager Plus is using Windows Authentication and therefore you need to run the command prompt with service account privilege.
* Click **Browse** and select the .ppm file that you downloaded. As a part of patch integrity verification from KMP build 6300 onwards, you must import an SSL certificate to complete the upgrade process. Click here to download the SSL certificate to be imported.
* In the pop-up that opens, click **Browse** and import the SSL certificate you downloaded from the aforementioned page.
* Click Install in the Update Manager window to begin the upgrade process. Wait for a few minutes until the upgrade pack is fully installed. Please note that importing the SSL certificate is mandatory while upgrading KMP from version 6.2 to 6.3. However, this is a one-time operation and you need not repeat the process during the next version upgrade
* Click **Close** and then click **Exit** to exit the Update Manager tool. If you are applying multiple upgrade packs one-by-one, exit the Update Manager tool after applying one upgrade pack and make sure that the database process is not running. Then proceed with running the Update Manager tool to apply the next upgrade pack and so on.
* If you are applying multiple upgrade packs, do the following for each upgrade; exit the Update Manager, start & stop the Key Manager Plus service once, and execute the upgrade steps.
* After applying the upgrade packs, start the Key Manager Plus service.

### Reinstall KMP on the Secondary Application Server

After upgrading the primary server to the latest version, You can reinstall the latest version of Key Manager Plus on your secondary server. Note: Ensure the software architectures are the same i.e. 32-bit/64-bit. You can download Key Manager Plus from this [link.](https://www.manageengine.com/key-manager/download.html)

### Reconfigure Failover Service

After reinstalling the secondary server, you can perform the steps detailed in the [failover service help documentation](https://www.manageengine.com/key-manager/help/failover-service.html) to configure failover service in the secondary application server again.

If you need any assistance or clarifications, please contact keymanagerplus-support@manageengine.com.

Note:

Key Manager Plus also allows you to [schedule database backups](https://www.manageengine.com/key-manager/help/ssh-key-disaster-recovery.html#DatabaseBackup) from within the product, and provides a script to restore the data for assistance in case of disaster/data loss. While it is recommended that you take a copy of the Key Manager Plus installation directory before applying the upgrade pack, you can always rely on the database backups scheduled from within the product if anything goes wrong.

### How Do I Find My Build Number?
