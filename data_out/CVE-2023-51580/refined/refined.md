- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of the AVRCP protocol, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `avrcp_parse_attribute_list` function of the BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive information. The vulnerability could be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability via Bluetooth. The target must connect to a malicious device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and must convince the target user to connect to their malicious Bluetooth device. The attacker does not require any privileges.
