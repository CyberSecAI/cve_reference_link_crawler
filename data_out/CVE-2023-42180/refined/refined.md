The provided content relates to CVE-2023-42180.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the `/user/upload` component of lenosp versions 1.0 to 1.2.0. The application does not properly validate the file type being uploaded, allowing for the upload of malicious files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file upload vulnerability
- Lack of proper file type validation
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability can be triggered by uploading an HTML file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary HTML code via a crafted JPG file.
- Successful exploitation can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves uploading a file through the `/user/upload` component.
- Attackers can intercept the data packet during file upload and change the file extension to bypass basic validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log in to the backend system.
- The attacker needs access to the user management functionality in system management, specifically to create a new user.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify data packets during the file upload process.
