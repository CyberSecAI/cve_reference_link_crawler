- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization in the CMS text editor allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users or administrators when they access the affected pages. This can lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with editor or publisher permissions and can inject the malicious code through the CMS text editor, specifically within the form fields of articles or other content areas.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the editor or publisher role, which grants permissions to modify content through the CMS text editor.
