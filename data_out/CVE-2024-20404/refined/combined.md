For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-finesse-ssrf-rfi-Um7wT8Ew>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Finesse in the default configuration.  The following Cisco products that may be bundled with Cisco Finesse are also affected by these vulnerabilities:    + Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (Packaged CCE)   + Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Unified CCE)   + Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX)   + Unified Intelligence Center For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20404: Cisco Finesse SSRF Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an SSRF attack on an affected system.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain limited sensitive information for services that are associated to the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  **Note:** The Security Impact Rating (SIR) is Medium due to the limited scope of information that is accessible to the attacker.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwh95292](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh95292), [CSCwk36966](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk36966)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20404Severity Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 7.2CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2024-20405: Cisco Finesse Stored XSS through RFI Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack by exploiting an RFI vulnerability.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive information on the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwh95276](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh95276), [CSCwk36966](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk36966)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20405Severity Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following tables was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and which release included the fix for these vulnerabilities.          | Cisco Finesse Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 11.6(1) ES11 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 12.6(2) ES01 and earlier | 12.6(2) ES03 |         | Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 12.0 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 12.5(1) SU3 ES05 and earlier | 12.5(1) SU3 ES06 (future release) |       **Note:** Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise, Unified Contact Center Enterprise, and Unified Intelligence Center are upgraded autonomously.
