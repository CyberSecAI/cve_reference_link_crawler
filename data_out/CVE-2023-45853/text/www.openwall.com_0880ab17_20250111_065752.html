The fix was included in this week's zlib 1.3.1 release:
<https://github.com/madler/zlib/releases/tag/v1.3.1>

That release also contains a fix for CVE-2014-9485, a path traversal
vulnerability, in the miniunz program from the minizip contrib directory:
<https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/14a5f8f266c16c87ab6c086fc52b770b27701e01>
