These are stored in 16-bit fields in the zip file format. Passing longer values would generate an invalid file.

Passing very long values could also cause the computation of zi->ci.size\_centralheader to overflow, which would cause heap buffer overflow on subsequent writes to zi->ci.central\_header.

This was reported to Chromium in <https://crbug.com/1470539>, and patched in <https://crrev.com/1182507> and <https://crrev.com/1182669>

Is there a way to upgrade to 1.3.1 which is not vulenarble? |

| [@raghu298](https://github.com/raghu298) You are still not telling me what "it" is that is saying that. I don't need to know the message. I want to know who the *messenger* is. What, exactly, is reporting this? Are you running something to tell you this?  What do you mean that it is "occurring in python:3.11.8 image"? Are you scanning the Python executable? Are you running Python code? What are you doing to incite the message? |

| [@madler](https://github.com/madler) I have trivy image scan tool which scans the image and shows the vulnerabilities. I am using python 3.11.8-slim image which is built on top of debian image and that has zlib1g "InstalledVersion": "1:1.2.13.dfsg-1" which is vulnerable(see above msg). Is there a way to upgrade to zlib1g to 1.3.1 version in the python/ debain image? |

| You would have to find a version of the Python 3 executable with a newer zlib, or rebuild one yourself.  But you don't have to. Python does not use minizip, so there is no vulnerability. If you have installed the pyminizip package, it may be vulnerable, but your tool is not reporting it there. It is reporting the zlib version being used by the Python executable.  In short, you do not have a problem. trivy is wrong. |

| [@madler](https://github.com/madler) i think python image is built on top of debain image so the tool is scanning python image and finding the vulenarability. Issue is with debian image |

| [@Ajith-Reddy1205](https://github.com/Ajith-Reddy1205) I don't know how to make this any clearer.   1. You do not have a problem that needs fixing. Your current version of zlib1g *does not have that vulnerability*. It does not have minizip in it. It never did. You do not need to do anything. Just carry on. 2. This is not the place to ask about how to update Python or Debian. |

| Thanks for the clarification [@madler](https://github.com/madler), the remaining problem is, that trivvy marks it as vulnerable nevertheless and trivvy get's this information from the debian security tracker (<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45853>), which claims, that zlib1g with version 1:1.2.13.dfsg-1 is indeed vulnerable. So the question is, how to get the entry in debian security tracker fixed? Because my management as well is asking me, when the critical vulnerability will be fixed. |

| Same here, debian images (and all images based on debian, including for instance python images) are marked as critically vulnerable by Trivy. As Trivy is based on debian security-tracker, and zlib 1.2 is marked as vulnerable in the debian security tracker, I guess it would require that the debian team upgrades zlib to 1.3 in a future release for Trivy to mark it as not vulnerable. But in the Trivy report, [CVE-2023-45853](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mq29-j5xf-cjwr "CVE-2023-45853") is marked as "Won't fix" in Debian Bookworm (which I wonder where this comes from ?) and zlib is upgraded to 1.3 only in Debian Trixie. So it looks like it will stay like this until the release of Trixie (next year ?).  ``` ~$ trivy image debian:stable-slim  debian:stable-slim (debian 12.5)  Total: 78 (UNKNOWN: 0, LOW: 57, MEDIUM: 15, HIGH: 5, CRITICAL: 1)  ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê ‚îÇ      Library       ‚îÇ    Vulnerability    ‚îÇ Severity ‚îÇ    Status    ‚îÇ   Installed Version   ‚îÇ Fixed Version ‚îÇ                            Title                             ‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê ‚îÇ          ...       ‚îÇ         ...         ‚îÇ    ...   ‚îÇ     ...      ‚îÇ           ...         ‚îÇ      ...      ‚îÇ                            ...                               ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§ ‚îÇ zlib1g             ‚îÇ CVE-2023-45853      ‚îÇ CRITICAL ‚îÇ will_not_fix ‚îÇ 1:1.2.13.dfsg-1       ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ zlib: integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer       ‚îÇ ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ                     ‚îÇ          ‚îÇ              ‚îÇ                       ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_6                           ‚îÇ ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ                     ‚îÇ          ‚îÇ              ‚îÇ                       ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45853                   ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò  ``` |

| Sigh. I tried.  It is this page: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45853> , that incorrectly marks 1:1.2.13.dfsg-1 as vulnerable, when in fact it has no minizip code in it whatsoever. (I verified that by downloading it and listing the external symbols in the .so file.) I managed to reach someone at debian.org who seems to be in control of that page, but instead of fixing the page, they defended it, even though it's wrong. |

| This is really weird. It's really against their interest to have ALL Debian images flagged as critically vulnerable for so long. |

| I'm just putting this as a FYI, to try and help people who might land here looking for answers.  Mark's probably sick of hearing about this by now. Sorry Mark, I just didn't see anyone post a public discussion of this with the details I was looking for. Maybe at least I gave you some things to link to if it would help?   * I did some legwork on this. From what I understand this is a false positive detection in the Debian images. Unfortunately there's a ton of Debian based container images that will get flagged, Debian is a very popular base image. * The source code of that particular version of zlib has a vulnerability, but the vulnerable part isn't in the Debian package. The Debian binary for zlib doesn't contain the vulnerable code.   Unfortunately it looks like Bookworm and all older releases will be flagged by this, and this will only be (coincidentally) fixed by the next major release (Trixie). Debian doesn't have a target date for that release right now, but if they keep up with their usual release schedule, I'd guess that won't be for over a year from now.  Here's some other things for further reading, I put more information in them:   * Here's the discussion thread where I mentioned this was a false positive: [Debian Bookworm CVE-2023-45853 in zlib 1:1.2.13.dfsg-1 has been marked as ignored, but trivy still shows it as a vulnerability¬†aquasecurity/trivy#6722](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/6722) . They said Debian misclassified the status of the CVE. * I also made a Debian bug report, <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1071276> and reached out to their security team. They said the CVE is classified properly. * It sounds like Debian is using "ignored" for this package instead of "not\_affected" and that's what's giving trivy heartburn about this, and it sounds like they're not willing to change it from "ignored" to "not\_affected".   I'm not sure if there's a way to modify the code of trivy to handle this case better, but it seems like there's not, because it sounds like "ignored" might be used in the Debian tracker for both "won't fix" and "not affected", and Trivy interprets "ignored" as "this container image is still vulnerable" so that distinction is very important for corporate vulnerability dashboards. I notice that Clair (<https://github.com/quay/clair>) also seems to have the same problem.  It would seem like the Debian tracker is meant for humans to read, not bots, and tools that try and "simplify" things by reducing that to "you have 10 vulnerabilities" have a hard time handling that. I'm not going to bug either trivy or Debian anymore.  Summary:   * Don't bug Mark, there's nothing that can be done from his side * Whether debian or trivy is wrong depends on your definition of "ignored", "not affected", and "won't fix" * It seems like debian and trivy can't be made to agree on that.   Hope that helps |
