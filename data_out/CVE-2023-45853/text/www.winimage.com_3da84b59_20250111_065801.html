# Minizip: Zip and UnZip additionnal library

![--](blu1.png)

Note (2022) : minizip source are avaiable on the [contrib/zlib github page](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/minizip). There is also [minizip-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/minizip-ng), a rewritten library with more feature (like [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng), a reworked and faster zlib)

. You'll also find [SmartVersion](https://www.smartversion.com/) with [source code](https://github.com/gvollant/smartversion).

Click to download Minizip (zip/unzip) package
for zLib version [1.01h](unzip101h.zip),
with minor bugfixes, or, better, [1.1](unzip11.zip) (with zip64 support).

This package enables to extract files from a .zip archive file.
It is compatible with [PKZip 2.04g](http://www.pkware.com),
[WinZip](http://www.winzip.com),
[InfoZip](http://www.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/),
[MimarSinan Codex Suite 2002](http://www.mimarsinan.com) tools,
and compatible sofware.

It runs both under Linux and Windows, and probably other systems too.
Encryption, multi-volume Zip files (span), and old compression methods used by
old PKZip 1.x are not supported.

See appnote-011203-iz.zip
or appnote-iz-latest.zip
for the specification of ZIP format
(or [appnote-981119-iz.zip](http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/doc/appnote-981119-iz.zip) for older versions).
Pkware provides also probdesc.zip and an
[HTML page](http://www.pkware.com/products/enterprise/white_papers/appnote.html)
with the specification.

## What is Minizip (Zip/Unzip)?

The [Zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) library allows to deflate
compressed files and to create gzip (.gz) files. Zlib is free software and small.

An archive in ZIP format can contain several files compressed with this method, while
a .gz archive can containt only one file. It is a very popular format, that is why I have
written a package for reading files compressed within a Zip archive.

## How to get the Minizip package

You need the source code of Zlib ([**zlib125.zip**](http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/zlib125.zip)
or [**zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz**](http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz).
For previous version, get [zlib114.zip](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib114.zip),
or by FTP zlib114.zip).

Now, with version 1.23,1.24,1.25 and 1.14 of zLib, the Minizip library is inlucded in the
contrib/minizip directory.

In [**zlib125dll.zip**](http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/zlib125dll.zip)
there is the Win32 Windows DLL of my Windows DLL named Zlibwapi.dll that contains both zLib and Minilib.

For previous version, in <zlib114dll.zip> you will find Windows DLL
(Win16 and Win32) and static library (Win32) of Zlib 1.14 WITH zip/unzip package.

Please note I have added in <buildzlib114dll.zip> the
version of zip.c/unzip.c (0.21).

You must read zip.h and unzip.h, which contains the
documentation of the zip and unzip functions.

March 2003: you can get [version 0.21](unzip21.zip) with
support of custom I/O functions to read and write zip files, and raw I/O
(in order to duplicate files from one zip archive to another without
uncompressing nor compressing). There is also a [modified](unzip21zcr.zip)
version of unzip with uncrypting, written by Terry Thorsen).

You can also get version [0.22e](unzip22e.zip) with
crypting/uncrypting (do a #define NOCRYPT if you don't need it) and adding
a file to an existing Zip archive.

15 March 2010: You can now download version [1.01h](unzip101h.zip),
with minor bugfixes, or, better, [1.1](unzip11.zip) with zip64 support.

Justin Fletcher wrote a very simple implementation of a memory access method
for the ioapi code (<ioapi_mem_c.zip>).
Ivan A. Krestinin wrote a [small example](del.cpp) of how
delete a file from zip archive. This example is not fully tested
(memory leaks are possible if the source archive is corrupt), but it might help you.

## Unzipping files

The source code is made of only two files: unzip.h and unzip.c (plus
ioapi.c and a few other include files). It uses the Zlib library.

miniunz.c is a very simple, but real unzip program. It can display files
contained in a Zip archive or extract them.

## A C++ Wrapper

Daniel Godson made a
[C++ wrapper](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/ZipUnzip.asp)
to the zip/unzip library. Another can be found at
[Troels page](http://home.worldonline.dk/troels_k/code/).

## A full MFC sample

In the [CodeGuru](http://www.codeguru.com) developers site,
there is an [excellent example](http://codeguru.developer.com/misc/mapizip.shtml),
'Implementing a "Send as ZIP-File" command in Scribble' written by
Stefan Kuhr. Unfortunately, this
example is not built with the good, standard zLib DLL (see the
[DLL page](index.html)). Download
<mapizip_demo_gooddll.zip> for a
fixed project which uses the good DLL.

## Extension to Minizip

Troels K. worked hard on the Minizip library. He has made several
[add-on](http://code.trak.dk/#ZIP), including a proposal
for unzAttach/unzDetach.

## Other examples

Jukka Pihl wrote [mod\_ziplook](http://pihl.kumpu.org/ziplook/)
Apache module. It enables to view zip archive files directly in Apache without
extracting them to the filesystem. It also uses HTTP compression
(supported by [W3C](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/#Compression),
like [Microsoft IIS](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/iis/maintain/featusability/httpcomp.asp),
Apache [mod\_deflate](http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html) and
[examples in python and jython](http://www.xhaus.com/alan/python/httpcomp.html).
Bashuman Deb wrote a [FTP paging Support for miniunz](http://bashuman.tripod.com/ftpunzip.html).

## Miscellaneous

The [Gilles vollant software forum](http://www.winimage.info/forum/)
contain a section about Minizip.

Please also email me for feedback.

## Future of ZIP file format

It seems that the ZIP file format will changes. The web sites
[PCWorld](http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0%2Caid%2C110820%2C00.asp)
(and [this new article](http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0%2Caid%2C111062%2C00.asp)),
[IDG](http://www.idg.net/ic_1321254_9677_1-5043.html),
[SlashDot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/06/10/1542216&mode=thread&tid=185)
contain information about ZIP's future. PkWare site contains a
[new specification](http://www.pkware.com/products/enterprise/white_papers/appnote.html),
InfoZip has also a
ZIP specification.
WinZip specifies also [new encryption](http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm).
The PKWare specification mentions a new BZip2 compression
method (there is a ["zlib-like" library for BZip2](http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/) compression).
