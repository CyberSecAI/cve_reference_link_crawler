## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Chart.js for WordPress <= 2023.2 - Editor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Charts > Settings".
2. For the Font Family, enter the payload: `</script>">//<SCRIPT>alert("XSS");</SCRIPT>.
3. Click on save and visit any page on the site to see the XSS.

### Affects Plugins
