- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management in the AMD Radeon Graphics driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the kernel driver (pdfwkrnl.sys) where an attacker can craft a malicious IOCTL request. This allows the attacker to gain I/O control over arbitrary hardware ports or physical addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker can send a crafted IOCTL request to the vulnerable driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the system and able to interact with the graphics driver.
