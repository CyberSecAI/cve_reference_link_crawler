Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6836

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in multiple functions within the Funnel Builder for WordPress plugin. This oversight allows unauthorized modification of plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing users to modify plugin settings via AJAX requests. Functions handling settings updates fail to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform such actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Settings Modification:** Authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access (or higher) can modify a wide range of plugin settings, including:
    - Templates
    - Designs
    - Checkouts
    - Other plugin configurations

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests
- **AJAX Endpoints:** The plugin exposes AJAX endpoints that are vulnerable. The `class-wfacp-ajax-controller.php` file is specifically identified as containing the vulnerable code
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site. Contributor-level permissions or higher are sufficient for exploitation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the WordPress site.
- **Contributor+ Access:** The attacker's account must have at least Contributor-level permissions. This provides the minimum level of access necessary to exploit the vulnerability by sending unauthorized requests.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Funnel Builder plugin up to and including version 3.4.6
- The fix is implemented in version 3.4.7
- The identified vulnerable file is `class-wfacp-ajax-controller.php`

In summary, this CVE describes an authorization bypass vulnerability in the Funnel Builder plugin that allows authenticated users with Contributor-level permissions or higher to modify crucial settings by sending crafted AJAX requests, due to a lack of proper capability checks.
