Affected Version(s): Please see the manufacturer note[4]

Vulnerability Type: Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2024-02-19
Solution Date: 2024-05-06
Public Disclosure: 2024-05-06
CVE Reference: CVE-2024-29150
Author of Advisory: Moritz Abrell, SySS GmbH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
ALE DeskPhones are modern desk phones which are used for the operation
in enterprise environments.
The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):
"Innovative deskphones and digital phones, delivering rich communications
in sleek designs, are essential for hybrid work."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
Due to improper privilege management, an authenticated attacker is able
to create symlinks to sensitive and protected data in locations which
are part of debugging files.
Given that the process of gathering debug logs is carried out with root
privileges, any file referenced in the symlink is consequently written
to the debug archive, thereby granting accessibility to the attacker.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
1. Create a symlink to sensitive and protected data at the location
"/data/core" on the phone with "admin" access
(e.g. via SSH or via USB debugging (UART)):
$ ln -s /config-fab/fabconfig/cert/cert.pem /data/core/cert.pem
$ ln -s /config-fab/fabconfig/cert/pkey.pem /data/core/pkey.pem
2. Plug-in a FAT32 formated USB drive to the phone.
3. Executing the debug process on the phone.
This can be done e.g. via the UI function "Maintenance/Debug/Get logs"
4. The files referenced in the symlinks are stored on the USB drive.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution:
Update the devices according to the manufacturer note[4].
