**Affected Models**

| **Model** | **Region** | **Hardware Revision** | **End of Support** | **Legacy Website** | **Last Updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DIR-822 | Non-US | All A & B Series H/W Revisions | 04/31/2018 | Not Available for Non-US SKUS | 01/30/2024 |

**Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products**

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands, new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
