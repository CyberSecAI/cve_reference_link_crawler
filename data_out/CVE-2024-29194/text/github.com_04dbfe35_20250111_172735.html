# Privilege Escalation via Local Storage Key Manipulation

High

GHSA-246p-xmg8-wmcq
Mar 24, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

7.0.1803

## Patched versions

7.0.1815

## Description

## Summary

A security vulnerability exists in oneuptime's local storage handling, where a regular user can escalate privileges by modifying the `is_master_admin` key to `true`. This allows unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.

## Details

The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of client-side stored data within the web application. Specifically, the `is_master_admin` key, stored in the local storage of the browser, can be manipulated by an attacker. By changing this key from false to true, the application grants administrative privileges to the user, without proper server-side validation.

## POC

(I am using Firefox Developer to demonstrate this vulnerability)

Log in as a normal user. Open developer tools (hit F12), click Storage, then Local Storage. Modify the `is_master_admin` key from `false` to `true`.

## Impact

This vulnerability represents a high security risk as it allows any authenticated user to gain administrative privileges through client-side manipulation. Most of the admin privileges were disabled except the user list. Where an attacker could see all the list of users who signed up to OneUptime.

## Patch

This has been patched in 7.0.1815

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
