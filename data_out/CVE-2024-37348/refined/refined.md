Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the administrative console of Absolute Secure Access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the management interface. This is specifically a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious script is saved within a management object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker with system administrator permissions can inject malicious scripts that are executed when another administrator edits the same management object.
*   The primary impact is on system integrity. The attacker can potentially alter data or functionality of the management console, which is a high impact on system integrity
*   There is no loss of confidentiality, and the impact on system availability is none.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the administrative console of Absolute Secure Access.
*   An attacker with system administrator permissions can inject malicious code when creating or modifying a management object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have system administrator privileges within the Absolute Secure Access management console.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create or edit a management object in such a way as to inject malicious code.
*   The attack is not directly exploitable by an unauthenticated or lower-privileged user, the code execution will only happen when another administrator edits the same management object,

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Absolute Secure Access versions prior to 13.06.
*   This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2024-37349 and CVE-2024-37351
*   The CVSS 3.1 score is 4.5 which is considered medium severity.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as requiring user interaction (UI:R), but only to trigger the stored malicious script that was previously saved within the management console by the attacker,
