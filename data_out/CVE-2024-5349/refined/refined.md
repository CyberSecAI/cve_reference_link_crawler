Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5349

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, specifically a path traversal vulnerability. The `map_style` parameter in the `google-maps.php` file within the LA-Studio Element Kit for Elementor plugin does not properly sanitize or restrict the file path provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, allowing an attacker to include and execute arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the `map_style` parameter.
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse the file system using the `map_style` parameter due to the lack of proper input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Bypass Access Controls:** This vulnerability can be used to bypass access controls, as the arbitrary file inclusion allows for the execution of PHP code that can have elevated permissions.
- **Sensitive Data Access:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data stored on the server, such as configuration files and database credentials.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, this vulnerability can provide complete access to the server, enabling the attacker to modify files, install malware, or pivot to other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the `map_style` parameter within the plugin's settings.
- **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers would send an HTTP request containing a malicious path within the `map_style` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Plugin:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable plugin and its usage of the `map_style` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:**  LA-Studio Element Kit for Elementor versions 1.3.8.1 and earlier.
- **Patched Version:** Version 1.3.9 addresses this vulnerability.
- **Vulnerable File:** The specific file vulnerable is `lastudio-element-kit/trunk/includes/addons/google-maps.php`.
- **Patch:** The patch involves modifying the `_get_map_style` function to correctly validate and sanitize file paths. Specifically, the changes include switching from `include`ing the file directly to using `file_get_contents()` and parsing the file as JSON, which prevents arbitrary code execution via PHP files.

This vulnerability is considered high severity due to the potential for complete system compromise through arbitrary code execution.
