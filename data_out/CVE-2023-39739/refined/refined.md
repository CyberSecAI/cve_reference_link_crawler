Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the exposure of the 'client secret' within the response of the `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry` request made by the 'REGINA SWEETS&BAKERY' mini-app on Line. This secret is intended to be confidential.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the client secret to the client-side (the user's device).
*   **Insecure Handling of Credentials:** The application inappropriately exposes the client secret, which should be securely stored and handled only on the server-side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Acquisition of Channel Access Token:** An attacker who obtains the client secret can then utilize it to obtain a channel access token.
*   **Malicious Broadcasts:** The channel access token is crucial for securing the communication channel within Line. With the token, an attacker can broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'REGINA SWEETS&BAKERY' mini-app.
*   **User Risk:** Users are at risk of receiving unsolicited malicious messages, which could include website links, fraudulent information, or other harmful content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** The client secret is exposed in a network response.
*   **Application Access:** The attacker needs only to have Line installed and open the affected 'REGINA SWEETS&BAKERY' mini-app to observe the leaked secret within network responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Access to Line:** The attacker needs a Line account and access to the 'REGINA SWEETS&BAKERY' mini-app.
*   **Ability to Intercept Network Traffic:** The attacker needs to be able to view the response from the `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry` request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report includes images of the vulnerable responses, and the process used to verify the exploit.
*   The report mentions the official definition of the channel access token, highlighting its importance for secure communication within Line.
*   It specifies the affected product as 'REGINA SWEETS&BAKERY' mini-app and the affected version is v13.6.1.
