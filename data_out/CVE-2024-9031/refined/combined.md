# Submit #410565: CodeCanyon CRMGo SaaS 7.2 Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | CodeCanyon CRMGo SaaS 7.2 Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Vulnerability Summary: Two critical stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were identified in CRMGo SaSS version 7.2. These vulnerabilities occur at two different endpoints (/deal/{note\_id}/note and /project/task/{task\_id}/show). An authenticated attacker with low privilege can inject malicious JavaScript into user-generated content (notes and comments), which is then stored and executed when other users, including administrators, view the affected pages. Successful exploitation allows attackers to steal sensitive data, impersonate users, and deploy phishing or malware attacks. Vulnerable Endpoints: /deal/{note\_id}/note - Notes field in the Deals module. /project/task/{task\_id}/show - Comments section in Project Tasks. Severity: High Impact: Phishing and malware deployment. User impersonation through session theft. Data leakage and potential full account compromise. Step to reproduce: Stored XSS 1 -------------------- Navigate to https://host/deal/list View a deal, then in the Notes field, input the payload "<script>alert("stored")</script>, then save the Notes by clicking on "Add" button. Stored XSS 2 --------------------- URL: https://host/project Endpoint: /project/task/ Parameter: The comment parameter is vulnerable to stored XSS 1. View any task 2. On the left side, click on comment. 3. Use payload "<script>alert(5)</script>" Credit: Jobyer Ahmed Organization: Bytium |
