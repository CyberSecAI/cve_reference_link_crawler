The provided content details two stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in CRMGo SaaS version 7.2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the application leads to stored XSS. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided notes and comments before storing them in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Lack of input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
   - Phishing and malware deployment
   - User impersonation through session theft
   - Data leakage and potential full account compromise
   - Malicious JavaScript execution in the context of the user's browser session

**Attack vectors:**
  - Injecting malicious JavaScript in the "notes" field when creating/editing a deal (`/deal/{note_id}/note`).
  - Injecting malicious JavaScript in the "comments" section when viewing a project task (`/project/task/{task_id}/show`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Authenticated user with low privileges capable of adding notes to deals and comments to tasks.
  - The attacker needs to access the vulnerable endpoints through the web application.
