Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28836:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability relates to a flaw in how Mbed TLS handles TLS version negotiation on the server side. Specifically, if the TLS 1.2 implementation is disabled, a malicious TLS 1.2 client can cause a denial of service or successfully establish a TLS 1.2 connection, contrary to the server's intended configuration.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is improper fallback handling during TLS version negotiation on the server. When TLS 1.2 is disabled (either at compile time or runtime), the server should not fall back to or accept a TLS 1.2 connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Fallback:** The server was incorrectly falling back to the TLS 1.2 implementation even when it was explicitly disabled.
*   **Version Downgrade/DoS:** If TLS 1.2 was disabled at compile time, a TLS 1.2 client could force the server into an infinite loop when processing a TLS 1.2 ClientHello, leading to a denial of service.  If TLS 1.2 was disabled at runtime, a TLS 1.2 client was able to successfully establish a TLS 1.2 connection with the server, effectively bypassing the intended configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A malicious client can cause the server to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service, if TLS 1.2 is disabled at compile time.
*   **Version Downgrade:** A malicious client can bypass TLS 1.2 runtime restrictions and establish a connection, potentially downgrading the connection to a less secure version of the protocol when TLS 1.2 is disabled at runtime.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is a malicious TLS 1.2 client initiating a connection with a server that has disabled TLS 1.2 support.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TLS connection with the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a TLS 1.2 ClientHello.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided text mentions that the issue is resolved in version 3.6.0 of Mbed TLS.
