- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `jsiValueObjDelete` function within `src/jsiEval.c` at line 464 when deleting a property of an array after unshifting elements into the array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow, specifically a read of size 8 at a wild pointer location.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to program crashes and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution if exploited further.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating an array in JavaScript, specifically setting a property, deleting a property, and unshifting elements into the array, through the execution of the crafted JavaScript code in the `jsish` interpreter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript code through the `jsish` interpreter.

The provided information includes a detailed error log of the heap-buffer-overflow and a minimal test case that can trigger it, including a full stack trace of the error. It also mentions that the vulnerability was found by the OWL337 team. This is more detail than a typical CVE description provides.
