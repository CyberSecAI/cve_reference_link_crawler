{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Brotli decompressor in Envoyproxy enters an infinite loop when processing Brotli data that contains extra input after the compressed data. The decompress method continues processing as long as input is available. After decoding the initial compressed data, subsequent calls to the Brotli library do not trigger an error, leaving the remaining data unchanged and causing an infinite loop.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Infinite loop during Brotli decompression.",
    "Lack of proper handling of extra input following compressed data."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. EnvoyProxy server becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop in the Brotli filter.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP request with a Brotli-compressed body that includes extra, uncompressed data appended at the end. The server attempts to decompress the crafted body which triggers the infinite loop.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to an EnvoyProxy server that is configured to use the Brotli decompressor filter."
