Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26145:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Discourse calendar plugin that allowed uninvited users to join private events by crafting a request to update their attendance status. The system failed to properly check if a user was invited before allowing them to mark their attendance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access control for private events. The plugin did not verify if a user was explicitly invited before allowing them to modify their attendance status.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability was exploitable because the system directly used the event ID in the request without checking if the current user should be allowed to interact with this event, especially if the event was private.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Uninvited users could gain access to private events, allowing them to view event details and potentially participate in discussions or activities related to the event.
*   **Privacy Breach:** This could expose private event information to individuals not intended to have access, potentially causing confidentiality issues and impacting the privacy of event participants.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through HTTP requests.
*   **Direct API Manipulation:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by crafting a specific API request to update their attendance status for a private event, bypassing the intended access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Discourse platform to make the API requests.
*   **Knowledge of Event ID:** The attacker needs to know the ID of the private event to craft the necessary API request.
*   **No Prior Invitation Required**: The vulnerability lies in the fact that an invitation was not needed for a user to set their attendance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix implemented in commit `dfc4fa15f340189f177a1d1ab2cc94ffed3c1190` specifically addresses this issue by disallowing self-invitations to private events.
* The provided information suggests that the vulnerability is present in Discourse calendar plugin versions >= 2201b254 and has been patched by later versions.
* The CVSS score of 6.5 with a base score of  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N aligns with the severity of the vulnerability. High Confidentiality impact because unauthorized users can gain access to the event information.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a lack of access control in the Discourse calendar plugin which allows uninvited users to join private events. By sending an attendance status update request with the event ID, uninvited users were able to join the private event and see the details of the event.
