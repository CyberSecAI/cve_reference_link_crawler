# express vulnerable to XSS via response.redirect()

Moderate

[ctcpip](/ctcpip)
published
GHSA-qw6h-vgh9-j6wx
Sep 10, 2024

## Package

npm

express
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<4.20.0
>=5.0.0-alpha.1, <5.0.0

## Patched versions

4.20.0
5.0.0

## Description

### Impact

In express <4.20.0, passing untrusted user input - even after sanitizing it - to `response.redirect()` may execute untrusted code

### Patches

this issue is patched in express 4.20.0

### Workarounds

users are encouraged to upgrade to the patched version of express, but otherwise can workaround this issue by making sure any untrusted inputs are safe, ideally by validating them against an explicit allowlist

### Details

successful exploitation of this vector requires the following:

1. The attacker MUST control the input to response.redirect()
2. express MUST NOT redirect before the template appears
3. the browser MUST NOT complete redirection before:
4. the user MUST click on the link in the template

### Severity

Moderate

5.0

# CVSS overall score

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-43796

### Weaknesses

[CWE-79](/advisories?query=cwe%3A79)
