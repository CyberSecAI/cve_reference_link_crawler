| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-05-31 13:38:29 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in libndp. A buffer overflow in NetworkManager that can be triggered by sending a malformed IPv6 router advertisement packet via malicious user locally.  This happens as libndp was not validating correctly the route length information and hence leading to a flaw. This affects versions of libndp >= 1.0.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c2)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2024-06-11 13:03:14 UTC  ``` Created libndp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2291319](show_bug.cgi?id=2291319 "NEW - CVE-2024-5564 libndp: buffer overflow in route information length field [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 13:16:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2024:4619 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4619](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4619)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 13:19:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2024:4618 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4618](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4618)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 13:34:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support  Via RHSA-2024:4622 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4622](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4622)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 13:59:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:4620 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4620](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4620)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 15:38:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:4636 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4636](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4636)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 15:44:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:4640 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4640](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4640)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 16:21:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:4643 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4643](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4643)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-18 16:27:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:4641 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4641](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4641)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2284122#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-19 10:20:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:4642 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4642](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4642)   ``` |  |

Package        : libndp
Version        : 1.6-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-5564
Debian Bug     : 1072366

It was discovered that there was a buffer overflow vulnerability in
libndp, a library for implementing IPv6's "Neighbor Discovery
Protocol" (NDP) and is used by Network Manager and other networking
tools.

A local, malicious user could have caused a buffer overflow in
Network Manager by sending a malformed IPv6 router advertisement
packet. This issue existed because libndp was not correctly
validating route length information.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.6-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libndp packages.

For the detailed security status of libndp please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libndp>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
