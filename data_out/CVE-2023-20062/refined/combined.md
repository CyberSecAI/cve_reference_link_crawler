Cisco plans to release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cuic-infodisc-ssrf-84ZBmwVk>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Unified Intelligence Center.  The following Cisco products that may be bundled with Cisco Unified Intelligence Center are also affected by these vulnerabilities:    + Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (Packaged CCE)   + Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Unified CCE)   + Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20061: Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.  This vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a specific REST API output. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to to obtain sensitive data, including hashed credentials for services associated to the affected device.  Cisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): CSCwd02972CVE ID: CVE-2023-20061Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2023-20062: Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on an affected system.  This vulnerability is due to improper input validation for specific HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary network requests sourced from the affected system.  Cisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): CSCwd01184CVE ID: CVE-2023-20062Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.0CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
