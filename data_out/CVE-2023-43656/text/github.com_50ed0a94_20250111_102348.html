# Potential sandbox escape for instances that have enabled transformation functions

Moderate

[Half-Shot](/Half-Shot)
published
GHSA-fr97-pv6w-4cj6
Sep 27, 2023

## Package

docker

half-shot:matrix-hookshot
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

<4.5.0

## Patched versions

4.5.0

## Description

### Impact

Instances that have enabled transformation functions (`generic.allowJsTransformationFunctions` in their config), may be vulnerable to an attack where it is possible to break out of the `vm2` sandbox. The vm2 library has been discontinued due to the complexity in fixing some [sandbox escapes](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2#%EF%B8%8F-project-discontinued-%EF%B8%8F), and as a result Hookshot will be vulnerable to this.

This problem is only likely to affect you if you have allowed untrusted users to apply their own transformation functions. If you have only enabled a limited set of trusted users, this threat is reduced (though not eliminated).

### Patches

Version 4.5.0 and above of hookshot include a new sandbox library which should better protect users.

### Workarounds

Disable `generic.allowJsTransformationFunctions` in the config.

### References

* The vm2 project describe their reasons for closing the project [link](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2#%EF%B8%8F-project-discontinued-%EF%B8%8F)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-43656

### Weaknesses

[CWE-94](/advisories?query=cwe%3A94)
