# Security Releases

When potential security holes are discovered in SilverStripe's [supported modules](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/project_governance/supported_modules/), we produce security releases to ensure that you are able to promptly secure your SilverStripe websites (check our [security release process](http://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/)). All releases are available on our [download](stable-download/) page, and are [announced](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases) on our forums (register to subscribe). Vulnerabilities in releases are disclosed here. Please subscribe to our security release [RSS feed](software/download/security-releases/rss) and [pre-announcement mailing list](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/contributing/release_process/#pre-announce-mailinglist) to stay updated.

* ### SS-2024-001 TinyMCE allows svg files linked in object tags

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2024-001
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.2.16
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.2.16
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  TinyMCE v6 has a configuration value convert\_unsafe\_embeds set to false which allows svg files containing javascript to saved which can be used as a vector for XSS attacks

  After patching the default value of convert\_unsafe\_embeds will be set to true. This means that object tags will be converted to iframes instead the next time the page is saved, which may break any pages that rely upon previously saved object tags. Users are to override this config if desired so that object tags are again used instead of iframes. Note that embed tags are not allowed by default.
  We reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.

  This vulnerability was described by TinyMCE as follows:

  *A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content loading and content inserting code. A SVG image could be loaded though an `object` or `embed` element and that image could potentially contain a XSS payload.*

  Severity:

  Versions Affected:silverstripe/reports: <5.2.3
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/reports: 5.2.3
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  The `Report` class has a `canView` method. If that method is configured to return `false`, the current user should not be able to view the report. While the report list will omit any `canView` `false` reports, those reports can still access them directly assuming the user has the `CMS\_ACCESS\_ReportAdmin` permission.

  After patching the `canView` check will be properly respected

* ### CVE-2023-49783 - No permission checks for editing or deleting records with CSV import form

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-49783
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1, ^2
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: 1.13.19, 2.1.8
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  Users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions.

  The likelyhood of a user having create permissions but *not* having edit or delete permissions is low, but it *is* possible.

  Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the [`showImportForm` public property](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Admin/ModelAdmin.html#property_showImportForm), nor does it impact the `SecurityAdmin` section.

  #### Action may be required

  If you have a custom implementation of [`BulkLoader`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html), you should update your implementation to respect permissions when the return value of [`getCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_getCheckPermissions) is true.

  If you are using any `BulkLoader` in your own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, you should consider passing `true` to [`setCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_setCheckPermissions) if the data is provided by users.

* ### CVE-2023-44401 - View permissions are bypassed for paginated lists of ORM data in GraphQL queries

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-44401
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/graphql: 4.3.7, 5.1.3
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page.

  Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn’t paginated per se.

  This has been fixed by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in your query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results.

  This behaviour is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly.

  You can choose to disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin following the instructions in [overriding default plugins](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/graphql/plugins/overview/#overriding-default-plugins).

  Note that this vulnerability does not affect silverstripe/graphql version 3.x.

  **Base CVSS: [5.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-40180 - DDOS Vulnerability on GraphQL due to lack of protection against recursive queries

  Severity:
  High ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-40180
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^3.0.0, ^4.0.0, ^5.0.0
  Versions Fixed:3.8.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.4, 5.0.3
  Release Date:2023-10-16

  An attacker could use a recursive graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed graphql schemas.

  If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this may further mitigate the risk.

  The fix includes some new configuration options which you might want to tweak for your project, based on your own requirements. See the documentation in the references for details.

  **Base CVSS: [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)**

* ### SS-2023-002 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities inherited form TinyMCE

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2023-002
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: ^1.13.6
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  TinyMCE 4.x is vulnerable to several XSS vectors, which had been patched in later versions. Two of these have been identified as affecting `silverstripe/admin`.

  Only Silverstripe CMS 4 is affected by these vulnerabilities. It's not possible to upgrade Silverstripe CMS 4 to use a more recent release of TinyMCE without introducing breaking changes. Instead, the security patches that shipped in later releases of TinyMCE have been backported to the TinyMCE version bundled in `silverstripe/admin`.

  Silverstripe CMS 5 is not affected by these vulnerabilities because it uses TinyMCE 6.

  These vulnerabilities were described by TinyMCE:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.

* ### CVE-2023-32302 Members with no password can be created and bypass custom login forms

  Severity:
  None ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-32302
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^3, ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 4.13.14, 5.0.13
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  When a new Member record was created in the cms it was possible to set a blank password. If an attacker knows the email address of the user with the blank password then they can attempt to log in using an empty password. The default member authenticator, login form and basic auth all require a non-empty password, however if a custom authentication method is used it may allow a successful login with the empty password.

  After being patched, blank passwords are no no longer allowed when members are created in the CMS. Programatically created Member records, such as those used in unit tests, still allow blank passwords.

  You may have some Member records in your system already which have empty passwords. To detect these, you can loop over all Member records with `Member::get()` and pass each record into the below method. It might be sensible to create a `BuildTask` for this purpose.

  ```
  use SilverStripe\Security\Member;
  use SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\MemberAuthenticator;

  private function memberHasBlankPassword(Member $member): bool
  {
      // skip default admin as this is created programatically
      if ($member->isDefaultAdmin()) {
          return false;
      }
      // return true if a blank password is valid for this member
      $authenticator = new MemberAuthenticator();
      return $authenticator->checkPassword($member, '')->isValid();
  }
  ```

  Once you have identified the records with empty passwords, it's up to you how to handle this. The most sensible way to resolve this is probably to generate a new secure password for each of these members, mark it as immediately expired, and email each affected member (assuming they have a valid email address in the system).

* ### SS-2023-001 - XSS vulnerability in underlying TinyMCE library

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2023-001
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: 1.12.7, 1.13.0
  Release Date:2023-04-26

  An old version of TinyMCE includes an XSS vulnerability, which was patched in a later version. The vulnerability is described by TinyMCE:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 4.9.10 or lower and TinyMCE 5.4.0 or lower.

  We reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.

  An attacker could use a specially crafted graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed and particularly large/complex graphql schemas.

  If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this will likely further mitigate the risk.

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2022-42949
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/subsites: ^2
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/subsites: ^2.6.1, ^2.7.0
  Release Date:2022-12-19

  The subsites module can weaken edit restrictions on some files and allow a malicious user to edit files they do not have edit rights to.

  This only affects projects with the subsites module installed. Regression testing should focus on custom file logic.

  Be advised that this is not a case of a user being able to edit a file in subsites they do not have access to. As a reminder, all separation of content achieved with the subsites module should be viewed as cosmetic and not appropriate for security-critical applications.

  **Base CVSS**: [5.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2022-38724
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^4.0.0, silverstripe/assets: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: ^4.11.13, silverstripe/assets: ^1.11.1
  Release Date:2022-11-21

  A malicious content author could add arbitrary attributes to HTML editor shortcodes which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front end of the site. The shortcode providers that ship with Silverstripe CMS have been reviewed and attribute whitelists have been implemented where appropriate to negate this risk.

  Most projects should be able to apply the patch without further work. There's no legitimate use case for this behaviour. If your project includes [custom shortcode providers](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/extending/shortcodes/#defining-custom-shortcodes), consider reviewing them and implementing a similar whitelist when rendering the shortcodes to HTML.

  Regression testing should focus on HTML Editor functionally relying on shortcodes:

  + image insertion
  + links to CMS resources
  + media insertion
  + custom shortcodes for your project.
