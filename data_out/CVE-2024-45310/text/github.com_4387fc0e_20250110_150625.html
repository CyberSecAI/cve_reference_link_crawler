# runc can be tricked into creating empty files/directories on the host

Low

## Package

gomod

github.com/opencontainers/runc
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=1.1.13, <=1.2.0-rc.2

## Patched versions

1.1.14, 1.2.0-rc.3

## Description

### Impact

runc 1.1.13 and earlier as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier can be tricked into

creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host

filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race

with os.MkdirAll. While this can be used to create empty files, existing

files **will not** be truncated.

An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom

volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but

the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced.

Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block

this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict

this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed.

This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and

Kubernetes.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N (Low severity, 3.6).

### Workarounds

Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the

attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root

user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual

user on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use

/etc/sub[ug]id), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to

create inodes in world-writable directories.

A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the

scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though we haven't

thoroughly tested to what extent the standard existing policies block this

attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack.

### Patches

Fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
