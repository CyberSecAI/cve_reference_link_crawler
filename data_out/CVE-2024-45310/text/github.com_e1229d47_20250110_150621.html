rootfs: try to scope MkdirAll to stay inside the rootfs

```
While we use SecureJoin to try to make all of our target paths inside
the container safe, SecureJoin is not safe against an attacker than can
change the path after we "resolve" it.

os.MkdirAll can inadvertently follow symlinks and thus an attacker could
end up tricking runc into creating empty directories on the host (note
that the container doesn't get access to these directories, and the host
just sees empty directories). However, this could potentially cause DoS
issues by (for instance) creating a directory in a conf.d directory for
a daemon that doesn't handle subdirectories properly.

In addition, the handling for creating file bind-mounts did a plain
open(O_CREAT) on the SecureJoin'd path, which is even more obviously
unsafe (luckily we didn't use O_TRUNC, or this bug could've allowed an
attacker to cause data loss...). Regardless of the symlink issue,
opening an untrusted file could result in a DoS if the file is a hung
tty or some other "nasty" file. We can use mknodat to safely create a
regular file without opening anything anyway (O_CREAT|O_EXCL would also
work but it makes the logic a bit more complicated, and we don't want to
open the file for any particular reason anyway).

libpathrs[1] is the long-term solution for these kinds of problems, but
for now we can patch this particular issue by creating a more restricted
MkdirAll that refuses to resolve symlinks and does the creation using
file descriptors. This is loosely based on a more secure version that
filepath-securejoin now has[2] and will be added to libpathrs soon[3].
