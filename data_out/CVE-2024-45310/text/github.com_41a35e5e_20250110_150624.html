### @cyphar **[cyphar](/cyphar)** commented [Jul 25, 2024](#issue-2428952733)

The logic for how we create mountpoints is spread over each mountpoint preparation function, when in reality the behaviour is pretty uniform with only a handful of exceptions. So just move it all to one function that is easier to understand.

nit: do we want to use %q for the destination here? It quotes the string, in case it has spaces and so
