[1.1] rootfs: consolidate mountpoint creation logic

[Browse files](/opencontainers/runc/tree/8781993968fd964ac723ff5f360b6f259e809a3e)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
The logic for how we create mountpoints is spread over each mountpoint
preparation function, when in reality the behaviour is pretty uniform
with only a handful of exceptions. So just move it all to one function
that is easier to understand.

# runc can be tricked into creating empty files/directories on the host

Low

[cyphar](/cyphar)
published
GHSA-jfvp-7x6p-h2pv
Sep 3, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/opencontainers/runc
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=1.1.13, <=1.2.0-rc.2

## Patched versions

1.1.14, 1.2.0-rc.3

## Description

### Impact

runc 1.1.13 and earlier as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier can be tricked into

creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host

filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race

with os.MkdirAll. While this can be used to create empty files, existing

files **will not** be truncated.

An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom

volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but

the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced.

Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block

this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict

this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed.

This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and

Kubernetes.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N (Low severity, 3.6).

### Workarounds

Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the

attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root

user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual

user on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use

/etc/sub[ug]id), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to

create inodes in world-writable directories.

A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the

scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though we haven't

thoroughly tested to what extent the standard existing policies block this

attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack.

### Patches

Fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.

[1.1] rootfs: try to scope MkdirAll to stay inside the rootfs

```
While we use SecureJoin to try to make all of our target paths inside
the container safe, SecureJoin is not safe against an attacker than can
change the path after we "resolve" it.

os.MkdirAll can inadvertently follow symlinks and thus an attacker could
end up tricking runc into creating empty directories on the host (note
that the container doesn't get access to these directories, and the host
just sees empty directories). However, this could potentially cause DoS
issues by (for instance) creating a directory in a conf.d directory for
a daemon that doesn't handle subdirectories properly.

In addition, the handling for creating file bind-mounts did a plain
open(O_CREAT) on the SecureJoin'd path, which is even more obviously
unsafe (luckily we didn't use O_TRUNC, or this bug could've allowed an
attacker to cause data loss...). Regardless of the symlink issue,
opening an untrusted file could result in a DoS if the file is a hung
tty or some other "nasty" file. We can use mknodat to safely create a
regular file without opening anything anyway (O_CREAT|O_EXCL would also
work but it makes the logic a bit more complicated, and we don't want to
open the file for any particular reason anyway).

libpathrs[1] is the long-term solution for these kinds of problems, but
for now we can patch this particular issue by creating a more restricted
MkdirAll that refuses to resolve symlinks and does the creation using
file descriptors. This is loosely based on a more secure version that
filepath-securejoin now has[2] and will be added to libpathrs soon[3].

Subject: CVE-2024-45310: runc can be tricked into creating empty
 files/directories on host

Due to the low severity of this CVE, this security patch is being released with
NO embargo period.

[ Summary ]

runc 1.1.13 and earlier as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier can be tricked into
creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host
filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race
with os.MkdirAll. While this can be used to create empty files, existing
files **will not** be truncated.

An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom
volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but
the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced.
Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block
this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict
this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed.

This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and
Kubernetes.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N (Low severity, 3.6).

[ Workarounds ]

Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the
attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root
user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual
user on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use
/etc/sub[ug]id), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to
create inodes in world-writable directories.

A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the
scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though we haven't
thoroughly tested to what extent the standard existing policies block this
attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack.

[ Patches ]

I've attached patches that apply cleanly for runc 1.1.13 and HEAD. We have also
released runc 1.1.14 and 1.2.0-rc3 which contain these patches, so if you
upgrade there is no need to apply these patches.

 * CVE-2024-45310.patch applies cleanly on top of runc HEAD[1]. If you are
   backporting the patch to apply on top of 1.2.0-rc2, you will need to also
   apply [2] at least.
 * 1.1-*.patch apply cleanly on top of 1.1.13.

rootfs: try to scope MkdirAll to stay inside the rootfs

While we use SecureJoin to try to make all of our target paths inside
the container safe, SecureJoin is not safe against an attacker than can
change the path after we "resolve" it.

os.MkdirAll can inadvertently follow symlinks and thus an attacker could
end up tricking runc into creating empty directories on the host (note
that the container doesn't get access to these directories, and the host
just sees empty directories). However, this could potentially cause DoS
issues by (for instance) creating a directory in a conf.d directory for
a daemon that doesn't handle subdirectories properly.

In addition, the handling for creating file bind-mounts did a plain
open(O_CREAT) on the SecureJoin'd path, which is even more obviously
unsafe (luckily we didn't use O_TRUNC, or this bug could've allowed an
attacker to cause data loss...). Regardless of the symlink issue,
opening an untrusted file could result in a DoS if the file is a hung
tty or some other "nasty" file. We can use mknodat to safely create a
regular file without opening anything anyway (O_CREAT|O_EXCL would also
work but it makes the logic a bit more complicated, and we don't want to
open the file for any particular reason anyway).

libpathrs[1] is the long-term solution for these kinds of problems, but
for now we can patch this particular issue by creating a more restricted
MkdirAll that refuses to resolve symlinks and does the creation using
file descriptors. This is loosely based on a more secure version that
filepath-securejoin now has[2] and will be added to libpathrs soon[3].

### @cyphar **[cyphar](/cyphar)** commented [Jul 25, 2024](#issue-2428952733)

The logic for how we create mountpoints is spread over each mountpoint preparation function, when in reality the behaviour is pretty uniform with only a handful of exceptions. So just move it all to one function that is easier to understand.

nit: do we want to use %q for the destination here? It quotes the string, in case it has spaces and so
