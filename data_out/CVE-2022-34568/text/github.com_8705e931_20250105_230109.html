| Hi, I found a potential memory leak bug in the project source code of libsdl, I have shown the execution sequence of the program that may generate the bug on a diagram which is shown below. The text in red illustrates the steps that generate the bug The red arrows represent call relationships The green text illustrates the files and functions whose code snippets are located below the green text. [1655522082614](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87304478/174420822-d0d14870-60ee-4e24-aed9-cb6ae20c00c1.jpg)  the code snippet related to libsdl of this bug is shown below:   [SDL-1.2/src/video/x11/SDL\_x11yuv.c](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL-1.2/blob/e1c3a1aa5b6e56e78bc1405f64a9bd7d952614b1/src/video/x11/SDL_x11yuv.c#L375-L381)  Lines 375 to 381 in [e1c3a1a](/libsdl-org/SDL-1.2/commit/e1c3a1aa5b6e56e78bc1405f64a9bd7d952614b1)   |  | if ( hwdata->image != NULL && hwdata->image->pitches[0] != (width\*bpp) ) { | | --- | --- | |  | /\* Ajust overlay width according to pitch \*/ | |  | XFree(hwdata->image); | |  | width = hwdata->image->pitches[0] / bpp; | |  | hwdata->image = SDL\_NAME(XvCreateImage)(GFX\_Display, xv\_port, format, | |  | 0, width, height); | |  | } |      I look forward to your reply and thank you very much for your patience! |
