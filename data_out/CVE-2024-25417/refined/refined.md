Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a missing or insufficient CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism in the `/core/tools/add_translation.php` component of flusity-CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate the origin of the request to the `add_translation.php` endpoint, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can force a logged-in user's browser to send a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Translation Modification:** In this specific case, the attacker can add/modify language translations within the CMS. The PoC shows the attacker creating a new translation with the key "cs" and the value "cs". This can potentially lead to manipulation of content, potentially injecting malicious scripts, or other undesirable changes within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website/Email:** An attacker could host a malicious website or send an email with a crafted HTML form that, when opened by a logged-in user, submits a forged request to the vulnerable CMS endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Target Must be Logged In:** The attacker needs a logged-in user session to be vulnerable since the attack relies on the user's existing authentication.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML and how forms work. They also need to understand how to craft a CSRF exploit, although tools like Burp Suite can automate this process.
- **No Direct Access to CMS Required:** The attacker does not need direct access or credentials to the CMS itself, but they require access to an authenticated user's browser through a malicious link or web page.
