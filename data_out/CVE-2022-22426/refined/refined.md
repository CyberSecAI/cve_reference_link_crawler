- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management, including bypassing authentication restrictions, information disclosure due to an unnecessary open port, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and reverse tabnabbing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass, information disclosure, XSS, CSRF, and reverse tabnabbing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access, information exposure, malicious script execution, and potentially hijacking user sessions.
- **Attack vectors**: The document does not specify the exact attack vectors for each vulnerability, but the identified vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over a network through web interfaces and interactions with the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities with network access to the application. More specific details on attacker capabilities are not provided in the context.
