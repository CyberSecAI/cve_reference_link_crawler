In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Use del_timer_sync in fw reset flow of halting poll

Substitute del_timer() with del_timer_sync() in fw reset polling
deactivation flow, in order to prevent a race condition which occurs
when del_timer() is called and timer is deactivated while another
process is handling the timer interrupt. A situation that led to
the following call trace:
