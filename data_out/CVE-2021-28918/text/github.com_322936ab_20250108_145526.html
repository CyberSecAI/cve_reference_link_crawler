[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-4c7m-wxvm-r7gc)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-4c7m-wxvm-r7gc/dependabot)

## Package

npm

netmask
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.1.0

## Patched versions

1.1.0

## Description

Improper input validation of octal strings in netmask npm package v1.0.6 and below allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many of the dependent packages. A remote unauthenticated attacker can bypass packages relying on netmask to filter IPs and reach critical VPN or LAN hosts.

❗ NOTE: The fix for this issue was incomplete. A subsequent fix was made in version `2.0.1` which was assigned [CVE-2021-29418 / GHSA-pch5-whg9-qr2r](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pch5-whg9-qr2r). For complete protection from this vulnerability an upgrade to version 2.0.1 or later is recommended.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
