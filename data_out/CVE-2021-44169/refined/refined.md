- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper initialization within the FortiClient (Windows) online installer. The installer incorrectly uses the current working directory, creating a potential vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An improper initialization vulnerability (CWE-665) where the FortiClient installer uses the current working directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can gain administrative privileges by placing a malicious executable within the FortiClient installer's directory.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker needs to place a malicious executable in the installer directory. The user must then launch the installer with user privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system is needed, and the attacker must have the ability to write files into the FortiClient installer's directory. The user needs to launch the installer, making it a user-assisted attack.
