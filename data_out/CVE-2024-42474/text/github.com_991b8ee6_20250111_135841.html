published
GHSA-rxff-vr5r-8cj5
Aug 12, 2024

## Package

pip

streamlit
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.37.0

## Patched versions

1.37.0

## Description

### 1. Impacted Products

Streamilt Open Source versions before 1.37.0.

### 2. Introduction

Snowflake Streamlit open source addressed a security vulnerability via the [static file sharing feature](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/serving-static-files). The vulnerability was patched on Jul 25, 2024, as part of Streamlit open source version 1.37.0. The vulnerability only affects Windows.

### 3. Path Traversal Vulnerability

#### 3.1 Description

On May 12, 2024, Streamlit was informed via our bug bounty program about a path traversal vulnerability in the open source library. We fixed and merged a patch remediating the vulnerability on Jul 25, 2024. The issue was determined to be in the moderate severity range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [5.9](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

#### 3.2 Scenarios and attack vector(s)

Users of hosted Streamlit app(s) on Windows were vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability when the [static file sharing feature](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/serving-static-files) is enabled. An attacker could utilize the vulnerability to leak the password hash of the Windows user running Streamlit.

#### 3.3 Resolution

The vulnerability has been fixed in all Streamlit versions released since Jul 25, 2024. We recommend all users upgrade to Version 1.37.0.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
