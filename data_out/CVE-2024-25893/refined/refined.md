Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation of the `CurrentFundraiser` GET parameter in multiple files. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core issue is a SQL injection vulnerability present in `FRCertificates.php`, `FRBidSheets.php`, and `FRCatalog.php`. The `CurrentFundraiser` parameter in the URLs is directly used in SQL queries without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database. This includes potentially user information, financial details, or other confidential data stored by the application.
*   **Data Tampering/Spoofing:**  Successful exploitation can lead to data modification, potentially changing transaction details, balances, or other critical data.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially cause data loss or make the system unavailable.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could gain full access to the database server and thus the whole application

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the following URLs:
    *   `/Reports/FRCertificates.php?CurrentFundraiser=[malicious SQL code]`
    *   `/Reports/FRBidSheets.php?CurrentFundraiser=[malicious SQL code]`
    *   `/Reports/FRCatalog.php?CurrentFundraiser=[malicious SQL code]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application server. No specific user privileges are required beyond that, since it is a publicly accessible feature.
*   The attacker can be remote, given that the attack vector involves HTTP requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in ChurchCRM version 5.5.0.
*   The issue was fixed in a later version, with a pull request that sanitizes the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter and uses the ORM to get fundraiser data.
*   The provided PoCs include examples of boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection.
