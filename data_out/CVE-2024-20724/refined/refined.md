- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read leading to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited locally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code, likely by crafting a specific input file or by using the software in a specific way. User interaction is required, meaning the user needs to open a malicious or specially crafted file. The attacker does not need special privileges on the target system.
