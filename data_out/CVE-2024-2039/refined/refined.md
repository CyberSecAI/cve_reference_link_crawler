Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2039

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the "Post(v2)" block of the Stackable Gutenberg Blocks plugin. Specifically, the `titleTag` attribute was not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `titleTag` attribute, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database. These scripts are then executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages, potentially leading to a variety of harmful actions.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  Malicious scripts can steal user session cookies, giving attackers access to user accounts.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or initiate downloads of malware.
*   **Website Defacement:**  Attackers can alter the content and appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the Stackable Gutenberg Blocks plugin.
*   **Specific Block:** The vulnerability is located in the deprecated "Post(v2)" block.
*   **`titleTag` Attribute:** The `titleTag` attribute of the block is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:**  Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with at least "Contributor" level permissions. This allows them to create or edit posts/pages using the vulnerable block.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to target the `titleTag` attribute of the "Post(v2)" block.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 3.12.11 of the Stackable Gutenberg Blocks plugin.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.12.12.
*   The fix included the addition of a check to ensure that the `titleTag` attribute is one of the allowed values: 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', or 'p'. If not, it defaults to 'h3'.
*   The output was also changed to use `wp_kses_post` which sanitizes HTML output.
