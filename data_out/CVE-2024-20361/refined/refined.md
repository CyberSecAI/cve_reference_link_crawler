- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the incorrect deployment of Object Groups for Access Control Lists (ACLs) feature from Cisco FMC Software to managed FTD devices in high-availability setups. Specifically, after a reboot of an affected device following the deployment of Object Groups for ACLs, the access controls are not properly applied.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control deployment leads to a bypass of configured ACLs on managed FTD devices in high-availability configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass configured access controls and send traffic to devices that were supposed to be protected by the affected device. This could expose protected assets depending on the importance of the assets protected by the bypassed ACL.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send network traffic through the vulnerable FTD device, bypassing the configured ACLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected FTD device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote.
