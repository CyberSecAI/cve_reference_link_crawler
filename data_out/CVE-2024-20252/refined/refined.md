- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the user has administrative privileges, this could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Persuading a user of the API to follow a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted link. The attacker needs to trick a legitimate user into clicking this link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Expressway Series devices when the cluster database (CDB) API feature has been enabled. This feature is disabled by default in Cisco Expressway Series releases 14.2 and later. In releases earlier than 14.2, the feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
- This vulnerability is grouped with CVE-2024-20254 and CVE-2024-20255. While the root cause is the same for 20252 and 20254, CVE-2024-20255 allows an attacker to overwrite system configuration settings, which could prevent the system from processing calls properly and result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
