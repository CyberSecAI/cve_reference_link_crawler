For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-expressway-csrf-KnnZDMj3>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products CVE-2024-20254 and CVE-2024-20255: These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Expressway Series devices in the default configuration.  CVE-2024-20252: This vulnerability affects Cisco Expressway Series devices if the cluster database (CDB) API feature has been enabled. This feature is disabled by default in Cisco Expressway Series releases 14.2 and later. In releases earlier than Cisco Expressway Series Release 14.2, the cluster database (CDB) API feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows: **CVE-2024-20252 and** **CVE-2024-20254: Cisco Expressway Series Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerabilities** Two vulnerabilities in the API of Cisco Expressway Series devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct CSRF attacks on an affected system.  These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwa25099](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25099) and [CSCwa25100](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25100)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20252 and CVE-2024-20254Security Impact Rating (SIR): CriticalCVSS Base Score: 9.6CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2024-20255: Cisco Expressway Series Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the API of the Cisco Expressway Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack on an affected system.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include overwriting system configuration settings, which could prevent the system from processing calls properly and result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwa25074](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25074)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20255Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.2CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
