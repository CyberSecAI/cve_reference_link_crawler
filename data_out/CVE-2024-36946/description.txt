In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phonet: fix rtm_phonet_notify() skb allocation

fill_route() stores three components in the skb:

- struct rtmsg
- RTA_DST (u8)
- RTA_OIF (u32)

Therefore, rtm_phonet_notify() should use

NLMSG_ALIGN(sizeof(struct rtmsg)) +
nla_total_size(1) +
nla_total_size(4)
