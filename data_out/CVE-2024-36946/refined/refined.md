{
  "CVE-2024-36946": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `rtm_phonet_notify()` function in the Linux kernel's phonet module incorrectly calculates the size of the sk_buff (socket buffer) it allocates for netlink messages. This leads to an undersized buffer being allocated.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect skb allocation size in `rtm_phonet_notify()`.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An undersized skb can lead to buffer overflow during data population. This can lead to data modification or Denial of Service.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `rtm_phonet_notify()` function is called.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to trigger the `rtm_phonet_notify()` function in the Linux kernel."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fill_route()` function stores three components in the skb: `struct rtmsg`, `RTA_DST` (u8), and `RTA_OIF` (u32), but `rtm_phonet_notify()` incorrectly calculates the buffer size",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"Incorrect calculation of required buffer size when allocating the skb in the `rtm_phonet_notify` function, leading to a buffer overflow when `fill_route()` populates it",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Potential for data modification or denial of service due to a buffer overflow when writing routing data",
      "Attack vectors": "Triggering the `rtm_phonet_notify()` which uses incorrect sizing for the network buffer",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger a phonet routing event that calls `rtm_phonet_notify()`"
