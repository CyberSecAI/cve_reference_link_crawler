Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-36930.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the reuse of an `spi_message` in the `spi_sync()` function when the SPI queue is not empty. Specifically, after a transfer is completed, the `complete` callback of the `spi_message` remains set, while the `context` is cleared. Subsequent calls that reuse the same `spi_message` can lead to a null pointer dereference when the `complete` callback is invoked within `spi_finalize_current_message()` because the context is null.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability.
- Improper handling of `spi_message` completion callback and context when reusing an `spi_message` with a non-empty queue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to null pointer dereference.
- Potential denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- Calling `spi_sync()` with a non-empty queue
- Reusing the same `spi_message` in subsequent calls

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger SPI transfers using the vulnerable `spi_sync()` function and reuse `spi_message` structures. This could be through a device driver or any other kernel code which is using SPI and calls this function.
