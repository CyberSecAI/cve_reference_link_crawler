This document contains information about CVE-2021-44390.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Format` command's JSON parameter parser assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object, but it does not validate this assumption. When a string or other non-object is provided, the code will attempt to access it as an object, leading to an assertion failure and subsequent reboot of the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The JSON parameter parser for the `Format` command does not validate the type of the `param` JSON element, leading to an assertion failure if it's not an object.
- Denial of Service: By sending a crafted HTTP request with a non-object `param` value, an attacker can cause the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash, resulting in a device reboot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the device to become unavailable due to a reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker sends a specially-crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON payload where the `param` for the `Format` command is a string (or another non-object) instead of an object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device.
- While many of these vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, this can be bypassed using TALOS-2021-1420 to make API calls without authentication.
