- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Courier Management System is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization/validation when processing user-provided data for account management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). User-supplied input is not properly sanitized/validated before being stored in the database and subsequently rendered in the web application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the system which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages. This can lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects a malicious payload (JavaScript code) in the 'first name' and 'last name' fields when updating user account information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account and be logged in to the system. They also need to have the capability to modify their account details.
