Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-37249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a faulty component in Infoblox NIOS that fails to sanitize malicious input. Specifically, a lack of proper validation on an input field allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to achieve remote code execution through the injection of malicious input.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the NIOS UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Shell Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain shell access to the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated NIOS UI Access:** The attack requires the malicious actor to have access to an authenticated feature within the NIOS UI.
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker must supply malicious input to the vulnerable field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to NIOS UI:** The attacker must possess valid credentials and have access to the NIOS UI.
- **Understanding of Vulnerable Input Field:** The attacker must identify the vulnerable input field to inject malicious commands.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** NIOS versions 8.5.2 and prior are affected.
- **Resolution:** The vulnerability is fixed in NIOS version 8.5.3 and later releases. A hotfix (NIOS-93969) is available for NIOS 8.5.2. The issue was also addressed in the hotfix for CVE-2023-2828.
- **Attribution:** The vulnerability was identified by Sean Morland of NCC Group.
