| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2293579#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-06-21 02:42:14 UTC  ``` Summary: An unauthenticated user can cause a systematic server crash while sending a specific extended search request.  Description: 389-ds-base  in RHEL 9.4 - RHDS 12.4, supports a new matching rule  (inchain or 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941). This matching rule requires that  the matching attribute has a DN syntax. If the attribute in the ldap client request is not DN syntax, the server logs a message. The format of the message requires an attribute but as the attribute is missing, it triggers a SEGV.  Steps to reproduce: See below   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2293579#c12)  Thomas Eagle    2024-06-28 21:14:09 UTC  ``` product definitions have been updated for 12.3, 12.4, and 12.5   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=2293579#c19)  Sandipan Roy    2024-07-09 17:05:18 UTC  ``` Public Issue: <https://github.com/389ds/389-ds-base/issues/5989>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=2293579#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-05 00:59:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Directory Server 12.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:4997 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4997](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4997)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=2293579#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-12 01:26:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:5192 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5192](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5192)   ``` |  |
