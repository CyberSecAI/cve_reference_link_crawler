| **Problem to solve** Computation of membership (like 'memberof') is a common issue. The issue is more expensive to solve when there are nested membership. For example "gives me all the groups this entry belongs to" or "gives me all subordinates having this manager". Either the LDAP client computes the values or dedicated plugin (like 'memberof') maintains direct membership attribute for the LDAP client. InChain Matching Rule allow a LDAP client to request the server to compute this membership.  **Solution** A first part of the solution was implemented with [slapi\_memberof](https://www.port389.org/docs/389ds/design/slapi_memberof.html) and [#5156](https://github.com/389ds/389-ds-base/issues/5156)  This ticket is to implement the second part that implement the MR, computes entries satisfying the membership and return those entries. The design is [here](https://www.port389.org/docs/389ds/design/matching-rule-in-chain.html) |

Bug description:
	Computation of membership (like 'memberof') is a common issue.
	The issue is more expensive to solve when there are nested membership.
	For example "gives me all the groups this entry belongs to" or "gives me
	all subordinates having this manager".
	Either the LDAP client computes the values or dedicated plugin (like 'memberof')
	maintains direct membership attribute for the LDAP client.
	InChain Matching Rule allow a LDAP client to request the server to compute this membership.

Fix description:
	The implementation is designed <https://www.port389.org/docs/389ds/design/matching-rule-in-chain.html>

	A specific fix in aclanom.c because inChain MR adds a acl DENY
        on 'cn=config'. There was a bug that cleared anonymous aci
        if the it existed a DENY acl anywhere (except a specific
        list of entries like 'cn=monitor'). It triggered a failure
	on chaining backend suite
