Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26258:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the handler of the `/lan.asp` route. Specifically, the `Device Name` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize the "Device Name" parameter, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.
- **Insufficient Backend Filtering:** Although there is a backend filter function `hasInjectionString` in the `lib/libleopard.so` file, it does not filter the newline character (`\n`), which can be used to break out of the intended command and inject a new one.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system. In the provided example, the attacker injects a command to start telnetd with a shell. This would allow the attacker to gain a shell on the device, with full control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/get_set.ccp` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `lanHostCfg_DeviceName_1.1.1.0` parameter, injecting a command using `%0a` (URL encoded newline) to bypass the backend filter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically means being on the same local network as the router, or having some sort of network access to the router's web interface.
- The attacker needs to know the specific parameter (`lanHostCfg_DeviceName_1.1.1.0`) to target, and needs to craft the payload to inject the desired command.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in D-Link DIR-820L devices with firmware version 1.05 B03.
- The front-end filtering can be bypassed by intercepting and modifying the traffic packets.
- The `\n` character not being filtered by the backend is key for the exploit.
