Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of filtering/sanitization of `GIT_CONFIG_*` parameters in GitLab CI/CD pipelines. Specifically, the values of `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_*` and `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_*` are used to modify the git configuration, leading to command injection.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Command Injection:**  The ability to inject arbitrary shell commands using `!bash -c` within the `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_*` parameters.
    *   **Unrestricted Git Configuration Modification**: Allowing modification of git configurations, such as `credential.helper`, using CI variables.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **CI Variable Exfiltration:** An attacker can extract protected CI/CD variables by executing commands like `env | base64` and sending the output to the pipeline logs.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can control the code that is checked out during the pipeline execution, effectively running arbitrary code within the CI environment, by setting up a malicious proxy that redirects to an attacker controlled repository/branch.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Attacker crafts specific `GIT_CONFIG_*` CI/CD variables when triggering a pipeline.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have at least `developer` access to the project, which grants the ability to run pipelines on a protected branch.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of sanitization of the `GIT_FETCH_EXTRA_FLAGS` CI variable, allowing manipulation of the git fetch command.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Git Command Injection:**  The ability to inject arbitrary git commands through the `GIT_FETCH_EXTRA_FLAGS` variable.
    *   **Bypassing Branch Protection:**  The ability to force a pipeline to use code from a different branch/commit, bypassing the intended branch protection mechanisms.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can make the pipeline use code from an attacker-controlled branch/commit, leading to arbitrary code execution within the CI/CD pipeline context.
    *   **Bypass Branch Rules:** The attacker can bypass push rules or MR approval requirements by running the pipeline with the attacker-controlled code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** The attacker crafts a malicious `GIT_FETCH_EXTRA_FLAGS` CI variable.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have at least a `developer` role with the permission to run pipelines on protected branches.

Both reports highlight a lack of proper input sanitization of CI variables used in git commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities and the ability to bypass branch protections. The root cause for both vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization of specific CI variables that are passed to git commands during the pipeline execution. The impact of both is similar, leading to potential CI variable exfiltration and arbitrary code execution within a protected branch's pipeline context.
