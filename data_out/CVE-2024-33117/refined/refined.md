Root cause of vulnerability: The `mergeList` method in the `com.zbkj.front.pub.ImageMergeController` class in crmeb_java v1.3.4 is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The `path` parameter flows into `java.net.URLConnection.openConnection()`, allowing an attacker to make requests to arbitrary URLs.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can make requests to internal or external resources, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial-of-service, or other attacks depending on the network configuration.

Attack vectors: The attacker crafts a request to the `/mergeList` endpoint with a malicious URL as the `path` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint, typically as an authenticated user depending on how the application is configured.
