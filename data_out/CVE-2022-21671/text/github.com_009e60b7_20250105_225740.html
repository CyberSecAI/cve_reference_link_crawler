This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Change the default polling host to `gp-v2.replit.com` ([#113](https://github.com/replit/crosis/pull/113))

```
We switched the host a few days ago, so it's better to reflect reality.

This changes the default polling host to `gp-v2.replit.com`.
