# Potential exposure of Replit tokens to an Unauthorized Actor when using the default fallback WebSocket polling proxy in @replit/crosis

High

published
GHSA-7w54-gp8x-f33m
Jan 10, 2022

## Package

npm

@replit/crosis
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<7.3.1

## Patched versions

7.3.1

## Description

### Impact

When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account).

### Patches

This was patched in 7.3.1, by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one.

### Workarounds

Specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`:

```
const connectOptions: ConnectArgs = {
  // ...
  pollingHost: 'gp-v2.replit.com',
};
client.connect(connectOptions);
```
