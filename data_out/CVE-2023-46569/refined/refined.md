The provided content relates to CVE-2023-46569.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A global buffer overflow occurs in the `print_insn32_fpu` function within the `nds32-dis.h` file when processing specific NDS32 instructions in radare2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Global buffer overflow vulnerability in `print_insn32_fpu` function.
- The overflow occurs due to incorrect handling of instruction decoding within the NDS32 architecture disassembler.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the radare2 application due to memory corruption, triggered by AddressSanitizer.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the vulnerability is further exploitable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a crafted NDS32 binary file with specific instructions that trigger the vulnerable code path in the disassembler.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted NDS32 binary file to the radare2 application to be analyzed.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access other than the ability to run radare2 on a vulnerable file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the analysis phase (`r2 -A`) of radare2.
- The issue was reported with AddressSanitizer output that pinpoints the location of the global buffer overflow.
- The initial fix for the vulnerability was later found to be incomplete, requiring a second fix.
- The vulnerable code is located in `libr/arch/p/nds32/nds32-dis.h`.
- The specific lines of code where the overflow occurs are line 993 in `print_insn32_fpu`, and originally line 1219 in `print_insn32` in the initial report.
- The vulnerability exists in radare2 versions 5.8.9 and earlier.
- The reported version of radare2 is `radare2 5.8.9`.
- The fix for the issue is available in radare2 version 5.9.0 and later.
- A proof of concept (POC) file (`poc`) is available in the github link provided.
