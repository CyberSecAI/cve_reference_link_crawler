Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22502

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   The vulnerability is a **remote code execution (RCE)** flaw found in Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter.
*   It arises from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before they are used in system calls.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the handling of the **Token** and **userName** parameters provided to the `LogonResource` endpoint.
*   An attacker can leverage this to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected server.
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is **insufficient input validation** of the `Token` and `userName` parameters, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection**: The application directly uses user-supplied input (`Token` and `userName` parameters) in a system call without proper sanitization or validation, allowing the injection of arbitrary commands.
*   **Lack of Authentication**: The vulnerable endpoint (`LogonResource`) does not require authentication, making it accessible to unauthenticated attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the OBR server.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: The code execution occurs in the context of the root user, granting the attacker full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a crafted request to the vulnerable `LogonResource` endpoint.
*   **HTTP**: The attack is carried out through HTTP requests, specifically targeting the `Token` or `userName` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access**: The attacker needs network access to the Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter server.
*   **No Authentication**: The attacker does not require any valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Pedro Ribeiro from Agile Information Security, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   Micro Focus has released a patch for the affected versions of Operations Bridge Reporter, which is referenced in the provided document.
*   The vulnerability affects Operations Bridge Reporter version 10.40.
*   CVSS v3 Score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   CVSS v2 Score: 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
