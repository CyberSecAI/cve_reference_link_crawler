Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45392:

**CVE-2022-45392**

*   **Vulnerability:**  Passwords stored in plain text.
*   **Root cause:** The NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin stores passwords in job `config.xml` files without encryption.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Sensitive information (passwords) stored in cleartext.
    *   Lack of proper encryption or obfuscation of stored passwords.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers with Item/Extended Read permission can view the unencrypted passwords.
    *   Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system can also view the unencrypted passwords.
    *   Compromise of these passwords could lead to further unauthorized access and actions related to the affected systems.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    *  Exploiting the lack of password encryption when stored in config files.
    *  Gaining unauthorized access to the Jenkins controller's file system, either through vulnerabilities or other exploits.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Attacker needs Item/Extended Read permission within Jenkins or access to the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Additional Notes**
* The advisory mentions that NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.146 addresses this issue by encrypting passwords once job configurations are saved again.
