{
  "CVE-2023-50883": {
    "Description": "The macro function in ONLYOFFICE Docs is vulnerable to a sandbox escape leading to cross-site scripting due to improper sandboxing and sanitizing of user input. The sandbox can be escaped by directly calling the constructor of the 'Function' object or the 'GeneratorFunction' object, which dynamically creates a function that executes in the global scope, bypassing the sandbox's local scope.",
    "Root cause": "Improper sandboxing and sanitizing of user input in the macro function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization",
      "Sandbox Escape"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the application, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "By inserting malicious JavaScript code into a macro within an ONLYOFFICE document. Specifically, the use of the 'Function' or 'GeneratorFunction' constructor to bypass the sandbox.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a document containing a macro, and have the ability to get a victim to execute it."
