{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient file path validation in the `save_edit_profile_details()` function within the WP Delicious plugin.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper path validation",
      "Arbitrary file move",
	  "Arbitrary file read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can move arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution, especially when moving critical files like `wp-config.php`. Additionally, arbitrary file reading is possible, which may expose sensitive data.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through the plugin's profile editing form. An authenticated user, with subscriber-level access or higher, can manipulate the `profile_image` and `profile_image_url` parameters during profile updates.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access. They need to be able to manipulate the profile update form."
  },
  "affected_versions": "All versions up to, and including, 1.6.9",
  "fixed_versions": "1.7.0"
