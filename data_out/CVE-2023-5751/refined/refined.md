Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the exposure of a shared resource (the working directory of affected CODESYS products) to an incorrect security sphere. Specifically, the working directory is located under `%ProgramData%\CODESYS\`, which is accessible to all local Windows users, instead of being restricted to the user context under which the application runs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere (CWE-668):** The primary weakness is the misconfiguration of file access permissions, leading to unauthorized access to files in the working directory.
- **Insecure Default Permissions:** The default location for the working directory grants read and write access to all local users, regardless of the user context under which the CODESYS application is executing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** Local users can read and modify files within the working directory of the affected CODESYS products.
- **Potential for Malicious Code Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious code into configuration files or other executables within the working directory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying critical files, attackers could cause a DoS condition, preventing the software from functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires a local attacker with access to the Windows system where the affected CODESYS products are installed.
- **File Manipulation:** Exploitation involves the attacker reading and/or modifying files within the shared working directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the Windows machine where the vulnerable software is installed. No specific privileges beyond standard user are required.
- **File System Access:** The attacker must be able to access the `%ProgramData%\CODESYS\` directory to read and modify files.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected products include CODESYS Control Win (SL), CODESYS Development System V3, CODESYS Edge Gateway for Windows, CODESYS Gateway for Windows, and CODESYS HMI (SL).
- The vulnerability affects all versions of these products prior to 3.5.20.10.
- The issue also affects the simulation runtime within the CODESYS Development System V3.
- The working directory is moved to `%APPDATA%\CODESYS\` in the patched version which restricts access to the respective user's context, fixing the issue. If the PLC is started with the "CODESYS Control Win SysTray PLC Control", it runs in the Windows user account "LocalSystem" and therefore the effective working directory is "C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\CODESYS\" or C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\CODESYS\, requiring administrator access to modify.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8.
