#### Details

---

#### Impact

The CODESYS Development System is an IEC 61131-3 programming tool for the industrial controller and automation technology sector. The integrated runtime for simulating CODESYS projects as well as CODESYS Control Win V3, CODESYS HMI and the CODESYS (Edge) Gateway running under the Microsoft Windows operating system have their working directory under %ProgramData%\CODESYS\ by default. All legitimate local Microsoft Windows users can read or modify files in this working directory, even if the affected products are running under a different user or in the system context.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

Only create required user accounts on the Microsoft Windows systems on which the affected software is installed. Users who do not need to use the affected software should not have access to these systems.

**Remediation**

Update the following products to version 3.5.20.10.

* CODESYS Control Win (SL)
* CODESYS Edge Gateway for Windows
* CODESYS Gateway for Windows
* CODESYS HMI (SL)
* CODESYS Development System V3

The CODESYS Development System and the products available as CODESYS add-ons can be downloaded and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer or be downloaded from the CODESYS Store. Alternatively, as well as for all other products, you will find further information on obtaining the software update in the CODESYS download area.

The working directories of the affected products are moved to "%APPDATA%\CODESYS", which is usually located in "C:\Users<user>\AppData\Roaming\CODESYS" and can only be accessed by the respective user.

If the PLC is started with the "CODESYS Control Win SysTray PLC Control", it runs in the Windows user account "LocalSystem" and therefore the effective working directory is "C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\CODESYS\" or C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\CODESYS\. An administrator account is required to access these folders.

5  Remediation

Update the following products to version 3.5.20.10.
• CODESYS Control Win (SL)
• CODESYS Edge Gateway for Windows
• CODESYS Gateway for Windows
• CODESYS HMI (SL)
• CODESYS Development System V3

The CODESYS Development System and the products available as CODESYS add-ons can be downloaded
and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer or be downloaded from the CODESYS Store. Alternatively, as
well as for all other products, you will find further information on obtaining the software update in the CODESYS
download area [4].

The working directories of the affected products are moved to "%APPDATA%\CODESYS\", which is usually
located in "C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\CODESYS\" and can only be accessed by the respective user.

If the PLC is started with the "CODESYS Control Win SysTray PLC Control", it runs in the Windows user
account "LocalSystem" and therefore the effective working directory is
"C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\CODESYS\" or

"C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\CODESYS\". An administrator account is
required to access these folders.

6  Mitigation

Only create required user accounts on the Microsoft Windows systems on which the affected software is
installed. Users who do not need to use the affected software should not have access to these systems.

7  General Security Recommendations

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH strongly recommends at least the following best-practice
defense measures:

• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside

• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks

• Activate and apply user management and password features

• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.

• Use encrypted communication links

• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required

• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions

For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [2].
