# Privilege escalation (PR) from account through AWM content fields

Critical

[mflorea](/mflorea)
published
GHSA-5mf8-v43w-mfxp
Aug 21, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-appwithinminutes-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

4.3-milestone-2

## Patched versions

14.10.5, 15.1-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

Any registered user can use the content field of their user profile page to execute arbitrary scripts with programming rights, thus effectively performing rights escalation.

The problem is present [since version 4.3M2](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7369) when AppWithinMinutes Application added support for the Content field, allowing any wiki page (including the user profile page) to use its content as an AWM Content field, which has a custom displayer that executes the content with the rights of the `AppWithinMinutes.Content` author, rather than the rights of the content author.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1 by [dfb1cde](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfb1cde173e363ca5c12eb3654869f9719820262) . The fix is in the content of the [AppWithinMinutes.Content](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfb1cde173e363ca5c12eb3654869f9719820262#diff-850f6875c40cf7932f40a985e99679a041891c6ee75d10239c06921c0019cf78R82) page that defines the custom displayer. By using the `display` script service to render the content we make sure that the proper author is used for access rights checks.

### Workarounds

If you want to fix this problem on older versions of XWiki that have not been patched then you need to modify the content of `AppWithinMinutes.Content` page to use the `display` script service to render the content, like this:

```
- {{html}}$tdoc.getRenderedContent($tdoc.content, $tdoc.syntax.toIdString()).replace('{{', '&amp;#123;&amp;#123;'){{/html}}
+ {{html}}$services.display.content($tdoc, {
+   'displayerHint': 'default'
+ }).replace('{{/html}}', '&amp;#123;&amp;#123;/html&amp;#125;&amp;#125;'){{/html}}

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
