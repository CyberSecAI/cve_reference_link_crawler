Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and the absence of prepared statements in specific database interactions within the Wallos application. Specifically, the `category` and `payment` GET parameters are directly incorporated into SQL queries without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `category` and `payment` GET parameters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (e.g., password hashes), subscription details, and other application data.
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database user's privileges, a successful SQL injection could potentially lead to full control of the database server, and consequently the system hosting the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through crafting malicious GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint. Specifically, the `category` and `payment` parameters are injected with SQL payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the Wallos application.
*   **No authentication is required:** The vulnerability is present in an endpoint that does not require user authentication, making it easily exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 1.16.0.
*   The fix implemented in version 1.16.0 addresses the SQL injection by implementing proper input sanitization/prepared statements.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is in a file that directly handles database interaction and lacks input validation.
*   Shodan search reveals multiple public instances of Wallos, indicating a potentially wide attack surface.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Matheus Boschetti and reported on March 9th, 2024.
*   The developers mitigated the vulnerability by releasing version 1.16.0 on March 10th, 2024.
