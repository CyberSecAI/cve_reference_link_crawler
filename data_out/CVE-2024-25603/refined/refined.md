- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Dynamic Data Mapping module's DDMForm. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `instanceId` parameter of the DDMForm.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must also be able to access and interact with the DDMForm module. The UI interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
