Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `view_info_user.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter from the GET request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and access sensitive information from the database, including customer information, personal data, trade secrets, and intellectual property.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data stored in the database.
- **Potential Full Database Compromise:** Depending on database privileges, attackers might gain full control over the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted GET request to the `view_info_user.php` file. The malicious SQL code is embedded within the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application hosting the vulnerable page.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious payloads.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable application**: The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable page (`view_info_user.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable code snippet from `view_info_user.php` is:
```php
$get_id=$_GET['id'];
$get_query=mysqli_query($conn,"select * from employee where employeeID='$get_id'")or die(mysqli_error());
```
- The provided SQLmap output demonstrates successful exploitation using error-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
    - Error-based Payload: `id=166'||(SELECT 0x5863715a WHERE 2674=2674 AND (SELECT 6770 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7176767071,(SELECT (ELT(6770=6770,1))),0x716b7a7a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a))||'`
    - Time-based blind Payload: `id=166'||(SELECT 0x6352424a WHERE 5250=5250 AND (SELECT 3715 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))dazK))||'`
- The GitHub content also explicitly states the vulnerability, the affected page, and provides a proof of concept using `sqlmap`.
