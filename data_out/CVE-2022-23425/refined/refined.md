The document contains the following entry:

> **SVE-2021-23582 (CVE-2022-23425): LTE NAS Authentication Bypass**
>
> Severity: Critical
> Affected versions: Q(10), R(11), S(12) with select Exynos devices
> Reported on: November 26, 2021
> Disclosure status: Privately disclosed.
> Improper input validation in Exynos baseband prior to SMR Feb-2022 Release 1 allows attackers to send arbitrary NAS signaling messages with fake base station.
> The patch fixes the logic that parse the NAS signaling messages.

This content directly relates to the specified CVE, and provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation within the Exynos baseband.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient validation of NAS signaling messages.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can send arbitrary NAS signaling messages, potentially leading to a bypass of the LTE network's authentication process by using a fake base station. This can lead to further malicious activities on the device or the network, although the exact nature of further impact is not specified.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is carried out by sending crafted NAS signaling messages from a fake base station.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to create or control a fake base station that can communicate with the targeted device.
    *   The attacker needs to be within range of the device with the fake base station.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft malicious NAS signaling messages.
    *   The vulnerability exists in devices using select Exynos chipsets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "Critical" in severity by Samsung.
*   The affected versions include Android 10, 11, and 12 on devices using select Exynos chipsets.
*   The vulnerability was privately disclosed.
*   The fix involved modifying the logic that parses the NAS signaling messages.
*   The fix was included in the Security Maintenance Release for February 2022 (SMR Feb-2022).
