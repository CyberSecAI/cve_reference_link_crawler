# Deserialization of untrusted data in torrentpier/torrentpier

Critical

[belomaxorka](/belomaxorka)
published
GHSA-fg86-4c2r-7wxw
Jul 13, 2024

## Package

composer

torrentpier/torrentpier
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<= 2.4.3

## Patched versions

v2.4.4

## Description

### Summary

In `torrentpier/library/includes/functions.php`, `get_tracks()` uses the unsafe native PHP serialization format to deserialize user-controlled cookies:

[torrentpier/library/includes/functions.php](https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/blob/84f6c9f4a081d9ffff4c233098758280304bf50f/library/includes/functions.php#L41-L60)

in
[84f6c9f](/torrentpier/torrentpier/commit/84f6c9f4a081d9ffff4c233098758280304bf50f)

|  | function get\_tracks($type) |
| --- | --- |
|  | { |
|  | static $pattern = '#^a:\d+:{[i:;\d]+}$#'; |
|  |  |
|  | switch ($type) { |
|  | case 'topic': |
|  | $c\_name = COOKIE\_TOPIC; |
|  | break; |
|  | case 'forum': |
|  | $c\_name = COOKIE\_FORUM; |
|  | break; |
|  | case 'pm': |
|  | $c\_name = COOKIE\_PM; |
|  | break; |
|  | default: |
|  | trigger\_error(\_\_FUNCTION\_\_ . ": invalid type '$type'", E\_USER\_ERROR); |
|  | } |
|  | $tracks = !empty($\_COOKIE[$c\_name]) ? @unserialize($\_COOKIE[$c\_name]) : false; |
|  | return $tracks ?: []; |
|  | } |

### PoC

One can use [`phpggc`](https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc/) and the chain `Guzzle/FW1` to write PHP code to an arbitrary file, and execute commands on the system. For instance, the cookie `bb_t` will be deserialized when browsing to `viewforum.php`.

### Misc.

Note that I also reported this issue by email on June 2nd, in "Unsafe deserialization leading to Remote Code Execution in get\_tracks()".

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
