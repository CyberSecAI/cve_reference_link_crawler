| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=29255#c0)  yuxuan He    2022-06-16 12:17:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14146](attachment.cgi?id=14146 "diagram of memory leak bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14146&action=edit "diagram of memory leak bug") diagram of memory leak bug  Hi, I found a potential memory leak bug in the project source code of binutils, and I have shown the execution sequence of the program that may have generated the bug on a diagram,which is added to the attachment The red text illustrates the steps that created the bug the red arrows represent the call relationships the green text illustrates the file and function where the code snippet is located below the green text.  In short, the key to the bug is the fourth and fifth steps in the diagram. The return value of the function called in the fourth step points to dynamically allocated memory, which should normally be further returned to the function caller, however, when the return value of the mkdir function is not equal to 0, the handling of the case simply returns the null pointer, and the dynamically allocated memory is then leaked, as shown in the diagram demonstrates. A free operation should be performed on tmpname when mkdir fails, to avoid memory leaks.   I look forward to your reply and thank you very much for your patience! ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=29255#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2022-06-17 11:59:32 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Alan Modra <amodra@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=d6e1d48c83b165c129cb0aa78905f7ca80a1f682>  commit d6e1d48c83b165c129cb0aa78905f7ca80a1f682 Author: Alan Modra <amodra@gmail.com> Date:   Fri Jun 17 09:13:38 2022 +0930      [PR29255](show_bug.cgi?id=29255 "RESOLVED FIXED - A Potential Memory Leak Bug"), memory leak in make_tempdir                  [PR 29255](show_bug.cgi?id=29255 "RESOLVED FIXED - A Potential Memory Leak Bug")             * bucomm.c (make_tempdir, make_tempname): Free template on all             failure paths. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=29255#c2)  Alan Modra    2022-06-17 12:19:19 UTC  ``` Fixed for 2.39 ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=29255#c3)  yuxuan He    2022-06-17 12:27:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alan Modra from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=29255#c2)) > Fixed for 2.39  thank you! ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=29255#c4)  Alan Modra    2022-06-19 06:38:38 UTC  ``` . ``` |  |
