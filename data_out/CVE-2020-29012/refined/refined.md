- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient session expiration. The fsuis token does not expire after logout.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is an insufficient session expiration vulnerability, specifically CWE-613. This means that after a user logs out, their session ID remains valid.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could reuse an unexpired admin user's session ID to gain information about other users configured on the device, if the attacker is able to obtain that session ID. The information disclosure is the impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to obtain the unexpired session ID, presumably through other attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to obtain a valid session ID which has not expired after logout.  The attack complexity is considered high and the attacker does not require privileges.
