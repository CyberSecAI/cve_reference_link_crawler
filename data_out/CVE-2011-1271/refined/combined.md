I came across a bug in code that is only reproduced when the code is built with optimizations enabled. I've made a console app that replicates the logic for testing (code below). You'll see that when optimization is enabled 'value' becomes null after execution of this invalid logic:

```
if ((value == null || value == new string[0]) == false)

```

The fix is straight forward and is commented out below the offending code. But... I'm more concerned that I may have come across a bug in the assembler or perhaps someone else has an explanation of why value gets set to null.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;

namespace memory_testing
{
    class Program
    {
        sta tic void Main(string[] args)
        {
            while(true)
            {
                Console.Write("Press any key to start...");
                Console.ReadKey();
                Console.WriteLine();
                PrintManagerUser c = new PrintManagerUser();
                c.MyProperty = new string[1];
            }
        }
    }

    public class PrintManager
    {
        public void Print(string key, object value)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Key is: " + key);
            Console.WriteLine("Value is: " + value);
        }
    }

    public class PrintManagerUser
    {
        public string[] MyProperty
        {
            get { return new string[100]; }
            set
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Pre-check Value is: " + value);
                if ((value == null || value == new string[0]) == false)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Post-check Value is: " + value);
                    new PrintManager().Print("blah", value);
                }
                //if (value != null && value.Length > 0)
                //{
                //    new PrintManager().Print("blah", value);
                //}
            }
        }
    }
}

```

The normal output should be:

```
Pre-check Value is: System.String[]
Post-check Value is: System.String[]
Key is: blah
Value is: System.String[]

```

The buggy output is:

```
Pre-check Value is: System.String[]
Post-check Value is:
Key is: blah
Value is:

```

  Clearly, the optimizer is angry with you for using '== false' instead of applying the ! operator to the expression.

  This has been assigned CVE-2011-1271 - The JIT compiler in Microsoft .NET Framework before 4 beta 2, when IsJITOptimizerDisabled is false, does not properly handle expressions related to null strings, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging a crafted application, as demonstrated by a C# application on the x86 platform.

Yes, your expression fatally confuses the JIT optimizer. The generated machine code looks like this:

```
                if ((value == null || value == new string[0]) == false)
00000027  test        esi,esi               ; value == null?
00000029  je          00000075
0000002b  xor         edx,edx               ; new string[0]
0000002d  mov         ecx,6D913BD2h
00000032  call        FFD20BC8
00000037  cmp         eax,esi               ; (value == new string[0]) == false?
00000039  je          00000075
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Post-check Value is: " + value);
0000003b  mov         ecx,dword ptr ds:[03532090h]  ; "Post-check value is: "
00000041  xor         edx,edx               ; BUGBUG not null!
00000043  call        6D70B7E8              ; String.Concat()
00000048  mov         esi,eax               ;
0000004a  call        6D72BE08              ; get Console.Out
0000004f  mov         ecx,eax
00000051  mov         edx,esi
00000053  mov         eax,dword ptr [ecx]
00000055  call        dword ptr [eax+000000D8h]     ; Console.WriteLine()

```

The bug occurs at address 41, the optimizer has concluded that value will always be null so it directly passes a null to String.Concat().

For comparison, this is the code that's generated when JIT optimization is turned off:

```
                    Console.WriteLine("Post-check Value is: " + value);
00000056  mov         ecx,dword ptr ds:[03342090h]
0000005c  mov         edx,dword ptr [ebp-8]
0000005f  call        6D77B790

```

The code got moved, but do note that at address 5c it now uses the local variable (value) instead of null.

You can report this bug at connect.microsoft.com. The workaround is simple:

```
  if (value != null)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Post-check Value is: " + value);
    new PrintManager().Print("blah", value);
  }

```

* Shouldn't be "if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(value))" instead as OP is comparing to an empty string as well.

This bug seems to have been fixed in .NET 4 (beta 2). Here's the optimized x86 disassembly for the bit nobugz highlighted, above:

```
                    Console.WriteLine("Post-check Value is: " + value);
00000056  mov         ecx,dword ptr ds:[033C2090h]
0000005c  mov         edx,dword ptr [ebp-8]
0000005f  call        65D8FE10

```

The program also displays the expected output in both optimized and unoptimized modes.

```
value == new string[0]

```

The above looks like a weird statement to me. You are comparing two string arrays with an equals statement. That will only result in true if they both point to the same array, which is quite unlikely. This doesn't explain yet why this code behaves differently in an optimized version.

I'm on x64 and couldn't reproduce the problem at first. Then I specified the target as x86, and it happened to me. Back to x64, and it went away. Not sure what this means, exactly, but I've gone back and forth a few times now.

Certainly looks like a bug, does it reproduce when you swap the operator operands like this?

```
if (false == (null == value || new string[0] == value))

```

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-044 - Critical

## Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2538814)

Published: June 14, 2011 | Updated: July 10, 2012

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution on a client system if a user views a specially crafted Web page using a Web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs). Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. The vulnerability could also allow remote code execution on a server system running IIS, if that server allows processing ASP.NET pages and an attacker succeeds in uploading a specially crafted ASP.NET page to that server and then executes the page, as could be the case in a Web hosting scenario. This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

This security update is rated Critical for all affected releases of Microsoft .NET Framework for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the JIT compiler within the .NET Framework validates certain values within an object. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2538814](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2538814) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on** **October 11, 2011?**

Microsoft revised this security bulletin to announce a detection change in the packages for KB2518870 and KB2518864 to correct an installation issue. This is a detection change only. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Is this security update related to MS11-039, Vulnerability in .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight Could Allow Remote Code Execution?**

No. Although both of these updates affect the .NET Framework, the security updates affect different components within the .NET Framework and are not related. These updates may be applied in any order.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin, this security update also deprecates ClickOnce support for the MD2 and MD4 hash. Once the update has been applied, applications signed with an MD2 or MD4 hash will no longer run. For complete details, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2562394](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2562394).

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4.0 and .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4.0 and .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4.0 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile. For more information, see [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5a4x27ek.aspx).

**I have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed; this version is not listed among the affected software in this bulletin. Do I need to install an update?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 and the .NET Framework 4.0 feature layers. The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installer chains in the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup, so installing the former also installs the latter. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed. Do I need to install any additional updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 and the .NET Framework 4.0 feature layers. The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 setup. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed also need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

## .NET Framework JIT Optimization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1271

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft .NET Framework validates certain values within an object. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1271](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1271).

#### Mitigating Factors for .NET Framework JIT Optimization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1271

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability only on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and only in a Web-based attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet [Explorer Enhanced Security](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039) Configuration.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. Users or accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users or accounts that operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a Web site and ASP.NET must be installed on that Web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).
* Standard .NET Framework applications are not affected by this vulnerability. Only specially crafted .NET Framework applications could exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for .NET Framework JIT Optimization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1271

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable partially trusted Microsoft .NET applications**

  To disable all Microsoft .NET applications running at partial trust, including XAML browser applications (XBAPs) and Microsoft .NET applications located on the network, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  caspol -pp off
  caspol -m -resetlockdown
  caspol -pp on

  ```

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to complete this workaround.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET applications may not run.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To reset the Microsoft .NET security policies to the defaults, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  caspol -pp off
  caspol -m -reset
  caspol -pp on

  ```

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to undo this workaround.
* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu, and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Reset all zones to default level**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for .NET Framework JIT Optimization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1271

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the JIT compiler within the .NET Framework incorrectly validates certain values within an object.

**What is the .NET Framework JIT compiler?**

The .NET Framework JIT compiler is a .NET Framework runtime component that compiles Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) against the Common Language Runtime (CLR) on demand at application run time, when the contents of an assembly are loaded and executed.

**What is the CLR?**

The Microsoft .NET Framework provides a run-time environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which runs the code and provides services that make the development process easier. For more information about the CLR, see the MSDN article, [Common Language Runtime Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ddk909ch%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What is the MSIL?**

The Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) is a CPU-independent instruction set that is generated by the Microsoft .NET Framework compilers and consumed by the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR). Before MSIL can be executed, it must be converted to native, CPU-specific code by the .NET CLR.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user or the user account of ASP.NET. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a Web browsing scenario, a Web hosting scenario, and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  If a Web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Windows .NET applications**

  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a Web application and a rich-client application. Like Web applications, XBAPs can be published to a Web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are three types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described as follows: systems that are using the Web browsing scenario, systems that are using the Web hosting scenario, and systems that are using the Windows .NET applications scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting Web sites using a Web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a Web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read e-mail on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.
* **Windows .NET applications**

  Workstations and server that run untrusted Windows .NET applications are also at risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the JIT compiler within the .NET Framework validates certain values within an object.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2011-1271](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1271).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
