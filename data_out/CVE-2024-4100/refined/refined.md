Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4100

**Description:** The Pricing Table plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in versions up to and including 2.0.1.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `ajax()` function of the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The plugin's `ajax()` function lacks proper nonce validation, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated attacker can potentially perform actions related to managing pricing tables. This includes adding, updating, removing and restoring pricing table data.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized modifications of pricing tables, or even denial of service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a forged request to the plugin's AJAX endpoint (`wp_ajax_` + slug + `_widgets_api`).
*   The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action that triggers the malicious request. This can be done by enticing the administrator to click a crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP request.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack but needs a logged-in administrator to inadvertently trigger the request.
*   The attacker needs to find a way to get the admin to click a link or load a malicious page that initiates the request.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `widgets-api.php` file within the plugin.
*   The specific method that is vulnerable is the `ajax()` function.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 8, 2024.
*   The plugin version affected is <= 2.0.1.
*   There is no known patch available.
