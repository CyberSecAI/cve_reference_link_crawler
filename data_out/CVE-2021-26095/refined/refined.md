- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper cryptographic operations in cookie encryption. The combination of various cryptographic issues in session management, particularly in the encryption construction of the session cookie, are the root causes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Weak encryption in session cookie leading to possible forgery
    - Insecure session management
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker with a valid cookie can reveal, alter, or forge its content, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker exploits session management vulnerabilities via the session cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must already possess a valid cookie and be able to send crafted requests with the forged cookie to the vulnerable server.
