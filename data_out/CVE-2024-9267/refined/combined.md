### Description

The Easy WordPress Subscribe – Optin Hound plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add\_query\_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Very easy to configured! The plugin is feather light. I loved this plugin but I have no idea about the subscription limitation. I hope it is unlimited!

Very easy to use and intuitive. The widgets and pop-ups also feature a nice, clean design with enough liberty for customising them.
