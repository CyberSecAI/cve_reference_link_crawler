Great, even emails letting you know about new subscriptions work!

Very easy to configured! The plugin is feather light. I loved this plugin but I have no idea about the subscription limitation. I hope it is unlimited!

Very easy to use and intuitive. The widgets and pop-ups also feature a nice, clean design with enough liberty for customising them.
