Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8665

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `add_query_arg` function without proper escaping within the YITH Custom Login WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `panel_page` parameter was not sanitized when constructing URLs, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize the `panel_page` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a URL. When a user clicks this crafted URL, the malicious script executes within their browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies, allowing account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to phishing websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing other client-side attacks, such as keylogging or injecting further malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `panel_page` parameter. 
- Attackers would need to distribute this malicious link to potential victims, typically through social engineering tactics, email phishing, or other means of tricking a user into clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to be a logged-in user to craft and exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers require some social engineering capabilities to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link.
- **No direct access to the webserver:** The attacker does not need any server-side access to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable code is located within the `yith-panel.php` file of the plugin, specifically when generating the navigation tabs.
- The fix involves using `esc_url` to properly sanitize the `panel_page` parameter before using it in a URL.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.4 of the plugin.
