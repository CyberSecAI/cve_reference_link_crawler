- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An error in the camera's web service causes improper exception handling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trigger a DoS attack, making the camera's web management page inaccessible. The device requires manual restart or power cycling to recover.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted URL to the camera's web service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required. The attacker can be in a network position where they can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable camera.
