Camera Vulnerability Report (CVE-2023-5037, 5038)

  OVERVIEW

-  Badmonkey, a security researcher, discovered two vulnerabilities in Camera and reported them

to Hanwha Vision S-CERT on July 12, 2023.

-

These two vulnerabilities are an authenticated command injection vulnerability that executes

OS commands and unauthenticated deny of service vulnerability.

CVE

Description

CVE-2023-5037

authenticated command injection using http parameter

CVE-2023-5038

unauthenticated deny of service using http parameter

  RISK ANALYSIS

CVE

Review Opinion

Severity

An attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands by

manipulating HTTP parameters. The execution of arbitrary

OS commands can be used to inject malware or configure

CVE-2023-5037

a backdoor. However, the attack requires credentials from

Middle

the camera web admin page to succeed. This means that

the vulnerability is only triggered if the attacker is

authorized to log into the product.

An error was found in the camera's web service that

could cause exception handling logic to be executed in

an improper manner. An attacker could execute a crafted

URL to trigger an unauthenticated DoS attack. In this

CVE-2023-5038

case, no one can access the camera's web management

High

page, and the device must be manually restarted or

powered back on. This vulnerability is considered to have

a significant impact on the product because it allows

attacks without authentication.
