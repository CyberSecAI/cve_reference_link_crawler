**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-45149

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of brute-force protection on an endpoint responsible for validating passwords for public talk conversations within Nextcloud Talk. This endpoint failed to register brute-force attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Brute-Force Protection:** The primary weakness is the absence of any mechanism to track or limit password validation attempts on the specified endpoint, which enabled brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Password Protection:** Attackers could bypass the password protection of public talk conversations by repeatedly attempting different passwords. This potentially allows unauthorized access to conversation content and participation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker does not need high-level privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability, only access to the network where the Nextcloud server is available.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack can be performed without any interaction from legitimate users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nextcloud instance running the vulnerable Talk application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was addressed in Nextcloud Talk versions 15.0.8, 16.0.6, and 17.1.1.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-307, which relates to improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts.
