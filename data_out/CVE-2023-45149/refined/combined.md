# Password of talk conversations can be bruteforced

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-7rf8-pqmj-rpqv
Oct 16, 2023

## Package

Talk
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 15.0.0, >= 16.0.0, >= 17.0.0

## Patched versions

15.0.8, 16.0.6, 17.1.1

## Description

### Impact

Brute force protection of public talk conversation passwords can be bypassed, as there was an endpoint validating the conversation password without registering bruteforce attempts

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk app is upgraded to 15.0.8, 16.0.6 or 17.1.1

### Workarounds

* No workaround available

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/2094473)
* [PullRequest](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/10545)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-45149
