## Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug where boolean page attributes that are checked by default show up as checked even if they have previously been saved unchecked (thanks hissy)
* Fixed some issues when attempting to use Redis to store session under certain conditions (thanks mlocati)

## Security Updates

* Fixed [CVE-2024-4350](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4350) Stored XSS in RSS Displayer with [commit 12166](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12166) for version 9 and with [commit c08d9671cec4e7afdabb547339c4bc0bed8eab06](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/c08d9671cec4e7afdabb547339c4bc0bed8eab06) for version 8. Prior to the fix a rogue administrator could inject malicious code into fields due to insufficient input validation. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.0 with a vector of [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1) and a CVSS v4 score of 2.1 with vector [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) Thanks m3dium for reporting HackerOne 2479824

Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could inject malicious code. The Concrete CMS team ranked this a CVSS v3.1 rank of 2 with vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) and a CVSS v4.0 rank of 1.8 with vector [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).
