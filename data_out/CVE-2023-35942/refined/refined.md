- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when a gRPC access logger, using the listener's global scope for stats, attempts to access the listener's scope after the listener has been drained. This happens because the access logger is cached and not removed during listener updates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (CWE-416).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (Envoy crash), rejection of requests.
- **Attack vectors:** Untrusted LDS (Listener Discovery Service) upstream.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to modify the listener configuration via an untrusted LDS upstream. They do not require any privileges within the Envoy instance itself, only the capability to modify its configuration.

The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description, specifying the affected component (opentelemetry/gRPC access logger extension), the exact root cause (use-after-free due to cached logger), and a concrete attack vector (untrusted LDS upstream). It also provides a Proof of Concept.
