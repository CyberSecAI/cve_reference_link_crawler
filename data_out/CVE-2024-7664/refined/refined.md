- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `id` parameter received via the GET method in the `view_details.php` file is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any sanitization or filtering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary database information, potentially including sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `view_details.php` file's URL using the HTTP GET method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and will likely need to authenticate to the admin panel to access the vulnerable page.
