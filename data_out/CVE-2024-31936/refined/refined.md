{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UsersWP plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to visit a malicious site or click on a malicious link, which will trigger a request to the vulnerable WordPress site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target WordPress site. They need to be able to get a logged-in user to interact with attacker-controlled content."
