Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-8876.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a path traversal flaw in the `lang` parameter within the `/index/ajax/lang` endpoint of TpMeCMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The application does not properly sanitize the `lang` parameter, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files by using directory traversal sequences like `../`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Read: An attacker can read sensitive system files, potentially leading to information disclosure, including database configurations, application source code, or other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/index/ajax/lang` endpoint.
- The `lang` parameter is used to specify the file path using path traversal sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable TpMeCMS instance.
- No authentication is required for exploiting the vulnerability.
