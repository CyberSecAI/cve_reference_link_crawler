Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-controlled input within the search result display of the Liferay Portal's Search Result app. Specifically, when search result highlighting is disabled, the application fails to sanitize user-provided content before displaying it in search results.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application's database and is executed when a victim views the search results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Web Script Execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code, which can be used to perform actions such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
- High Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Impact : CVSS score of 9.6 indicates a critical impact to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system, due to the attacker being able to run arbitrary code on the targeted application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the creation or modification of searchable content within Liferay. This can include:
    - Blogs
    - Message Board Messages
    - Web Content Articles
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Liferay Portal.
- The attacker needs the ability to create/modify searchable content within the Liferay application.
- The vulnerability occurs when the highlighting of search results is disabled.
