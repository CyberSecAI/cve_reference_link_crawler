Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of control over memory allocation during file downloads in M-Files Server. Specifically, there's no limit on the amount of memory that can be reserved by the server when handling file download requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The core issue is that the M-Files Server does not limit or throttle memory allocation when processing file download requests, especially for anonymous users.
*   **Excessive Allocation:**  The server allocates memory without bounds, leading to a potential exhaustion of resources when an attacker exploits this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a large number of file download requests or requests that trigger large memory allocations, an attacker can exhaust the server's memory, causing it to become unresponsive and effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending specially crafted file download requests over the network.
*   **Anonymous user exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous users without requiring any prior authentication or access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** Attackers must have network access to the M-Files Server.
*   **No special access needed:** The vulnerability can be triggered by anonymous users, which implies that no authentication or specific user privileges are required for exploitation.
*   **Ability to send file download requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests to the server to initiate the file download process.

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, which confirms the vulnerability can be exploited over the network, requires no special access or user interaction, and results in high impact to availability.
*   **CWE:**  CWE-770 "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling" was initially reported but later corrected to CWE-400 "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption."
*   **CAPEC:** CAPEC-130 "Excessive Allocation" is associated with this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**

*   M-Files Server versions prior to 23.4.12528.1 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to M-Files Server version 23.4.12528.1 or later to address the vulnerability.
