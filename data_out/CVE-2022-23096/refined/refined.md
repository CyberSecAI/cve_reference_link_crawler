{
  "CVE-2022-23096": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TCP server reply code path in ConnMan's dnsproxy component does not perform a size check to ensure that at least a complete DNS header has been received before processing the reply. This contrasts with the UDP server reply code path which does include such a check.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing size check on TCP DNS replies, leading to out-of-bounds reads.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious DNS server can send a minimal reply message (e.g., 4 bytes), which can cause `forward_dns_reply()` to operate on out-of-bounds heap data. This can lead to undefined behavior, potential denial of service (DoS), and possible heap-based information leaks.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious DNS server sends a crafted DNS response with a short length to the vulnerable client.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must control the DNS server or be able to spoof DNS replies on the network to send malicious DNS responses to the client."
