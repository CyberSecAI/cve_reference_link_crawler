The provided content describes a commit that fixes a bug in the Fuchsia kernel related to memory protection on ARM64 architecture. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from incorrect handling of the UXN (User eXecute Never) and PXN (Privileged eXecute Never) bits in the ARM64 Memory Management Unit (MMU). Specifically, the kernel was not setting the UXN bit on privileged executable pages, which allowed user-level code (EL0) to execute these pages, violating the intended privilege separation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect MMU configuration:** The kernel's logic for setting the UXN and PXN bits was flawed. It was setting these bits based on whether a page was explicitly mapped as non-executable rather than considering if the page was privileged. This oversight allowed user-level code to execute privileged code.
- **Missing User Execute Never (UXN) enforcement:** The primary weakness was the failure to enforce UXN on privileged executable pages when accessed from user mode.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious user-level process could potentially execute privileged code, gaining elevated access and control over the system. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Code Injection:** Attackers could potentially inject malicious code into a privileged memory region and execute it from the user context.

**Attack vectors:**

- A user-mode application can try to execute the privileged code if not protected by UXN flag
- The attack vector is any user-mode application that can obtain a pointer to kernel memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **User-level access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run code in user-level (EL0).
- **Memory access:** The attacker needs to be able to obtain an address of a privileged executable page.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involves changing the logic to properly set the UXN and PXN bits.
- User/privileged non-executable page: UXN=1, PXN=1
- User executable page: UXN=0, PXN=1
- Privileged executable page: UXN=1, PXN=0
- The fix also introduces a kernel unit test to validate the new mapping logic against the aspace.Query() API.
- This commit addresses bug 88451, and the fix was reviewed and approved before being committed.
