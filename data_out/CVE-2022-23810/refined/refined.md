Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-23810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-provided input in the profile page's username or in the entry title within the default theme's templates. This allows for the injection of template code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Template Injection (CWE-1336):** The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in template rendering. This allows an attacker to inject malicious template code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker could obtain arbitrary files on the server. This means an attacker could potentially read sensitive data, configuration files, or even source code from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to input the malicious code via the profile page user name or the entry title.
*   The attack is performed remotely over the network

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user and have the ability to modify either their profile name or create/modify entry titles, depending on the vulnerable location.

**Affected Versions:**

*   a-blog cms Ver. 3.0.x series versions prior to Ver. 3.0.1
*   a-blog cms Ver. 2.11.x series versions prior to Ver. 2.11.42
*   a-blog cms Ver. 2.10.x series versions prior to Ver. 2.10.44

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided JVN report confirms this vulnerability as template injection and provides a CVSS score.
*   The developer's blog post provides mitigation advice by checking templates for missing escape options and removing the `raw` option if present.
