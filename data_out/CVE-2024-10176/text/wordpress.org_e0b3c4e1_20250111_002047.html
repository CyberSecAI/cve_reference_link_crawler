It does what it promises very well. I have replaced the controls images with custom ones. Is it possible to get a code snippet to be able to choose between different “play” images?

Ridiculously simple. Works well. I customised the play/pause images to fit the design of my website. It plays audio. Job done. Please keep supporting it, it’s great!

The play button of this plug-in is pasted on the top page.
It is better not to take up extra space with compacts.
It’s been working fine so far. If it’s greedy, I think it would be even better if there were variations in icon design.

It’s a cute plugin. It’s been around a long time, nice to see the developer sticking with it.
I installed it years ago in a draft web site I still am working on.
I want a music file to play when someone loads the home page. Therefore, the autoplay option to play an audio/mp3 file as soon as the page loads is great.
However, it never stops playing. I have the player in the sidebar so the visitor can see it to shut it off if they want. However, there is no way to tell the little player to ONLY PLAY ONCE. That’s all I need it for. When the visitor arrives at the web site.
Unfortunately, is plays the music on every single page load.
I would kindly suggest that you add a default feature to limit plays to once, on the first page load, regardless of how many different pages are loaded.
Thanks for thinking about it.

I love the compactness, but it needs to kill all audio playing on the page when I hit the play button. Otherwise, we have multiple audio playing over each other.

I’m using it to play a couple different songs on multiple pages. Exactly what I needed. Simple, easy to use and a clean look.
