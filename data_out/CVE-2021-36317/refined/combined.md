# Rust: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202210-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust, the worst of which could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/rust** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.63.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.63.0-r1** |

| Package | **dev-lang/rust-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.64.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.64.0** |

### Background

A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Rust users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-1.63.0-r1"

```

All Rust binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-bin-1.64.0"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.38 or later should ensure that packages with Rust binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @rust-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @rust-rebuild

```

#### Symptoms

The steps for applying the hotfix are consistent for all Avamar Server versions, however, the screenshots used in this **KB article are for reference only**. The actual screens on your system may appear slightly different.

Check the **history tab** to verify previously installed hotfixes, follow **Appendix B** for instructions.
#### Cause

Avamar utilizes an Avamar workflow package (AVP) that automates the software steps needed to complete installing Hotfix. While this is an automated process monitoring progress and responding to prompts that require user input and any error that may occur during the installation is required.

**Requirements:**

* Valid license installed on the Avamar Server
* The Avamar system is healthy and functioning normally
* Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome Web browser.

**This procedure has three steps:**

1. Download the hotfix
2. Upload the hotfix to Avamar.
3. Install the hotfix.
#### Resolution

**Downloading the Hotfix**

The avp packages can be downloaded from the support site or links that are provided in DSA/DTA/KB article.

Below is an example of how to download the hotfix from the support site.

We are selecting **Avamar Server** and then the version number. Selecting download will download the file to the local machine.

Support page link:  [https://dell.com/support](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-in)

![Support page.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_2.jpeg)

![Downlaod.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_3.jpeg)

**Uploading the hotfix to Avamar using Avamar Installation Manager (AVI)**

Uploading is done using Avamar Installation Manager. Files can be uploaded from the local machine.

Check Appendix A if the direct upload does not work.

Follow the below steps from the local machine to upload the hotfix files.

* Using the web browser type the URL address for the Avamar :

[https://<avamarserver>/avi](https://<AvamarServer>:7543/avi)/  or https://<avamarserver>:7543/avi/  for newer version.

Where <avamarserver> is the hostname or IP address of the Avamar Server

![login.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_4.jpeg)

* Log in to installation manager using root credentials.
* Navigate to the **Repository** tab and upload the required **.avp** file.
* Uploading the package takes time. You can check the progress on the screen.
* In case the avp file is rejected, check the Avamar version and the avp version to see if they are matching.

![repository upload.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_5.jpeg)

![uploading.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_6.jpeg)

**Installing the hotfix using Avamar installation Manager**
 Once the hotfix is uploaded, navigate to the **SW Updates** tab to see the Available hotfix for installation.

In case it is necessary to re-log in to Avamar Installation Manager, follow the below steps.

1. In the web browser URL address box, type:

[https://<avamarserver>/avi](https://<AvamarServer>:7543/avi)/  or https://<avamarserver>:7543/avi/  for newer version.

![before install.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_7.jpeg)

**Note:** It may take up to 15 minutes for the package to appear. Click the refresh button in the top right of the window to refresh the package list.

2. When the Avamar hotfix package appears, click **Install**to execute the workflow.
3. The **Installation Setup** screen (displayed below) appears:

![Begin installing.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_8.jpeg)

4. Click on **Continue** at the bottom of the screen.
5. The installation runs and displays its progress.

![progress.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_9.jpeg)

Once the installation has completed, the progress page will show "**Completed hotfix-xxxxxx**" in the information log at the bottom of the page. The procedure is completed. Log out to exit out of the Avamar Installation Manager.

![Complete.jpg](https://supportkb.dell.com/img/ka06P000000PbToQAK/ka06P000000PbToQAK_en_US_10.jpeg)

**Cumulative hotfix installation**
**Note:** After a hotfix or cumulative hotfix installation, it may be necessary to upgrade the **Avamar Administrator GUI (MCGUI)**. If there is a version mismatch, a warning message shows when opening the Avamar Administrator GUI. In this case, an update is needed. For more information, see the Avamar Administrator Guide "Installing Avamar Administrator".

Starting Avamar 18.2 we have a new HTML5 web GUI, you can access by typing HTTPS://<hostname>aui
