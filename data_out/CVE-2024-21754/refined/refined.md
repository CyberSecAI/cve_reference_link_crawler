- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak key derivation function when generating the encryption key for backup files. Specifically, the password hash used has insufficient computational effort.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort (CWE-916)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - A privileged attacker with a super-admin profile and CLI access can potentially decrypt the backup file. This could expose sensitive information contained within the backup.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - An attacker would need super-admin profile and CLI access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker must have a privileged account with super-admin rights and be able to access the command line interface (CLI).
