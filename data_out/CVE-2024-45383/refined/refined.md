The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45383.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of IRP (I/O Request Packet) requests within the `HDAudBus.sys` driver, specifically when interacting with the `HDAudBus_DMA` interface via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). The driver incorrectly completes an IRP request using `IofCompleteRequest` when the `IrpDisposition` is set to `IrpProcessed` instead of `IrpNotCompleted` after `WmiSystemControl` returns an error, leading to a double-free when the kernel tries to free the same IRP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is a "multiple irp complete requests" issue caused by improper resource management within the `HDAudBus.sys` driver. The driver fails to check the `IrpDisposition` properly and completes the IRP prematurely, leading to a double-free scenario.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a local denial-of-service (DoS) condition, manifested as a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by issuing a specially crafted application that attempts to obtain a handle to the `HDAudBus_DMA` WMI block with the `WMIGUID_NOTIFICATION` flag set.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious script or application locally on the target system. A low-privileged user can trigger the vulnerability.
