Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue in the `/o/get/httpmeta` endpoint of the memos API.
*   The application directly uses user-supplied input (a URL) to make an HTTP request without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The application makes an HTTP request to a URL provided by the user. This allows an attacker to make the server connect to internal or external resources, which it normally shouldn't be able to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can enumerate the internal network and gather limited information by making requests to internal servers. The response from the target URL is returned in JSON format.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `/o/get/httpmeta` endpoint is accessible to unauthenticated users, making it easier to exploit.
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL and sends it as a query parameter to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target memos API server.
*   No specific user privileges are required, as the vulnerability is accessible without authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content also identifies two other related vulnerabilities: CVE-2024-29029 (SSRF leading to reflected XSS in `/o/get/image`) and CVE-2024-29030 (SSRF in `/api/resource`). However, this analysis focuses solely on CVE-2024-29028 as requested.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by a member of the GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) team.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.13.2 of the memos application.
*   The content includes a basic curl command that can be used to reproduce the SSRF vulnerability: `curl http://0.0.0.0:5230/o/get/httpmeta?url=<full url>`.
