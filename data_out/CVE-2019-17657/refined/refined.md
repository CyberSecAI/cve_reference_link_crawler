Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption issue in multiple Fortinet products. This occurs due to the way the affected products handle specially crafted HTTP requests/responses that are sent slowly, piece by piece.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Slow HTTP DoS Attack:** The core weakness lies in the products' susceptibility to slow HTTP denial-of-service attacks.  The web servers within the affected products keep resources tied up waiting for incomplete or slow data, which exhausts the server's connection pool.
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The vulnerability is categorized as "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption" because the server is unable to manage the resources used by the slow and incomplete requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service, making the web service portal inaccessible.  The server's resources become exhausted, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Slow HTTP Request/Response Handling:** The attack vector involves sending HTTP requests (or responses) in small pieces over an extended period. This slow, piecemeal transmission keeps server resources occupied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted web service. No specific user account or access level on the system is required.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must have the ability to craft and send HTTP requests, including requests that are intentionally incomplete or sent very slowly.
