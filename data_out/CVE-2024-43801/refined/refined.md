Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-43801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Jellyfin user profile image upload functionality accepts SVG files without proper validation. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code embedded within a crafted SVG file is stored on the server. When this SVG is viewed, the JavaScript executes.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The server doesn't properly sanitize or validate SVG files, allowing for the inclusion of executable script tags.
*   **Insecure Storage of Access Tokens:** Access tokens are stored in the browser's `localStorage` instead of using secure HTTP-only cookies. This makes them accessible to client-side JavaScript.
*   **Lack of Proper Access Control for Privileged Actions**: Administrative actions, such as adding plugin repositories, installing plugins, or modifying user privileges, do not require additional re-authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit the XSS vulnerability to steal an administrator's access token. They can then use this token to elevate their own user account to administrator privileges.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By adding a malicious plugin repository and installing a malicious plugin, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the host server. This allows the attacker to execute operating system commands.
*   **Full System Compromise**: By achieving RCE the attacker effectively compromises the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SVG Upload:** A low-privileged user uploads a specially crafted SVG file as their profile picture.
*   **Social Engineering/Direct Access:** An administrator views the malicious SVG file directly (e.g., by opening the image in a new browser tab or being sent the URL to it). This can be achieved by an attacker sending the URL to their profile picture to an administrator.
*   **XSS Execution:** When the administrator views the image, the embedded JavaScript executes.
*   **API Exploitation:** The attacker's JavaScript retrieves the admin's access token from `localStorage`. This token is then used to make API calls to escalate the low-privileged attacker user to admin status and install malicious plugins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the Jellyfin server to upload the malicious SVG.
*   **Administrator Interaction:** The attacker needs an administrator to view the malicious SVG file directly for the exploit to work.
*   **Network Access (for RCE):** For RCE, the attacker needs a web server where the malicious plugin manifest and DLL are hosted and accessible to the Jellyfin server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Jellyfin versions 10.8.0 and later up to 10.9.9.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.9.10 and later.
*   The fix implemented forces browsers to download the images rather than rendering them to prevent the XSS.
*   The exploit chain detailed in the blog goes beyond a simple stored XSS by adding in privilege escalation and RCE using a malicious plugin.
*   The blog post suggests best practice such as implementing `content-disposition: attachment` header, sanitizing SVG upon upload, implementing a content security policy, and requiring re-authentication for privileged functionality.
