### @nielsvanvelzen **[nielsvanvelzen](/nielsvanvelzen)** commented [Aug 21, 2024](#issue-2477641287)

The server serves images in various endpoints, those are meant to be displayed in the various clients and not for sharing. Setting the content disposition header to `attachment` will force a browser to download the images when opened directly instead of displaying them in the browser.

**Changes**

* Update item image endpoints
* Update plugin image endpoint
* Update user image endpoints
* Update splashscreen image endpoint

**Issues**

Sorry, something went wrong.

No idea how it's done in C# atm, but I'd refactor this into an annotation so it can be reused more easily across controllers?

| All image responses are already going through the `GetImageResult` method in ImageController, only exceptions being the plugin/trickplay images right now. We could improve this a bit so we also add caching headers to trickplay/plugin but that would be an enhancement for a non-patch release. |

| What exactly is the advantage of this? I see Content-Disposition: Attachment used less and less on the web today, because most users find it annoying if they open an image in a new tab and it doesn't open in a new tab as expected but downloads instead. |

| I understand the reasoning behind this, but it does make saving full-size thumbnails of stuff a little more inconvenient.  Sometimes, Jellyfin picks a show I like to generate a library thumbnail and I save it manually in case I want to keep that image or go back to it in the future.  Perhaps we should have an editor in the UI that allows us to click a button to generate thumbnails and then keep one that we like as a static option. |
