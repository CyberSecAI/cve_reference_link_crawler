# Privilege escalation to admin from a low-privileged user via SVG upload

Moderate

[joshuaboniface](/joshuaboniface)
published
GHSA-vcmh-9wx9-rfqh
Sep 2, 2024

## Package

Jellyfin

## Affected versions

>=10.8.0

## Patched versions

>=10.9.10

## Description

### Description

The Jellyfin user profile image upload accepts SVG files, allowing for a stored XSS attack against an admin user via a specially crafted malicious SVG file. When viewed by an admin outside of the Jellyfin Web UI (e.g. via "view image" in a browser), this malicious SVG file could interact with the browser's LocalStorage and retrieve an AccessToken, which in turn can be used in an API call to elevate the target user to a Jellyfin administrator.

### Exploitability

The actual attack vector severity is low, as it requires specific actions by the administrator to view the SVG image outside of Jellyfin's WebUI, i.e. it is not a passive attack. However Administrative permissions on the Jellyfin server presents a moderate impact to the security and integrity of the underlying system. The overall severity is thus moderate.

### Resolution

The underlying exploit mechanism is solved by [#12490](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/pull/12490), which forces attached images (including the potential malicious SVG) to be treated as attachments and thus downloaded by browsers, rather than viewed. This prevents exploitation of the LocalStorage of the browser.

As a workaround, **Administrative users should never view user SVG profile pictures externally for untrusted users**. Always download and inspect for malicious content first.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-43801

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
