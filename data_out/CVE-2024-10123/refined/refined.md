Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `compare_parentcontrol_time` function within the Tenda AC8v4 router firmware. Specifically, it is located in `/goform/saveParentControlInfo`. The function uses `sscanf` to parse a user-provided `time` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `sscanf` function is used without any length checks on the input parameter `time`. This allows an attacker to provide an overly long string, overwriting data on the stack, including return addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overflowing the stack, an attacker can crash the device's service, causing a denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The overflow can overwrite the return address (`ra` register in the provided example), potentially allowing an attacker to redirect execution flow and achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerable parameter `time` is within the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Tenda router.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` that is vulnerable.
*   **Crafted Request:** The attacker needs to craft a POST request with an overly long `time` parameter value.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is in the `compare_parentcontrol_time` function.
*   The vulnerable parameter is 'time'.
*   The `sscanf` function reads the `time` parameter into stack variables `local_2c` and `local_4c` without any bounds checking.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to crash the service, while the registers change demonstrate the potential for RCE.

This information provides a clear understanding of the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC8v4 routers.
