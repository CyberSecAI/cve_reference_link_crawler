Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-26043:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application, and then executed when other users view the affected content.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. This allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially gaining unauthorized access, stealing sensitive data, or performing other malicious activities within the application.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L). The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), and the attack requires user interaction (UI:R). The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C).
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need a low privilege account and must be able to inject malicious script through the application. They would require a user to interact with the stored malicious content in order to execute their script.
