- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the ability of an administrative user to delete system accounts necessary for the device's operation through the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is an insecure user management implementation in the web interface that allows deletion of critical system accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by deleting accounts that are needed for the device to function correctly.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed via the web interface using an administrative user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the affected device's web interface.
