**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The document upload process in GLPI can be manipulated to delete arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is related to the document upload process.
- The specific vulnerability is that the upload process can be "diverted" to delete files. This suggests a path traversal or similar issue where an attacker can manipulate file paths used in the upload process.
- The provided information links this to CWE-73, which is "External Control of File Name or Path".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Availability:**  A successful attack can lead to the deletion of files, which would result in high impact on the availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Attack Complexity:** The attack has low complexity, meaning it's relatively easy to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileges required:**  Low level privileges are required to perform the attack.
- **User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the exploit to work.
- **Scope:** The scope is changed, indicating a security scope change occurs.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a file deletion vulnerability via document upload in GLPI, where an attacker with low privileges can remotely delete files due to improper handling of file paths within the upload process (CWE-73).

**Additional Notes**
- The content does not provide specific technical details on how the file deletion is achieved. The description suggests path manipulation during the upload process, which leads to the deletion of files other than those intended.
- This vulnerability is patched in version 10.0.10.
