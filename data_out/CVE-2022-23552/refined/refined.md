Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of SVG files within the Grafana application. Specifically, it was discovered that SVG files were not being properly processed to prevent the execution of embedded JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be embedded within SVG files, which are then stored within the Grafana application. When a user views content displaying the unsanitized SVG, the injected script executes within their browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information to the attacker.
-   **Data Modification/Addition:** Exploitation may allow attackers to add or modify data within the Grafana instance.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with Editor role could potentially escalate privileges to a user with Admin role by injecting malicious JavaScript that targets the Admin user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **External URL:** An attacker can include an external URL pointing to a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript.
-   **Data Scheme:** An attacker can use the `data:` scheme to load an inline SVG file with embedded malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Editor Role:** The attacker must have at least the Editor role within the Grafana instance to modify panel configurations.
-   **User Interaction:** A user with higher privileges (e.g., Admin) must view the panel/dashboard where the malicious SVG is displayed for the exploit to execute.

**Additional Information:**
-   The vulnerability was discovered during an internal audit of Grafana.
-   The vulnerability is present in Grafana versions >=8.1.x
-   The provided GitHub content shows the fix was to add a `dompurify` preprocessor step to sanitize SVG.

The NetApp advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate Grafana and are thus susceptible to the same vulnerability. However, they listed no affected products.
