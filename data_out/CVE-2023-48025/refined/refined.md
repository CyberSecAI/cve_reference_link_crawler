Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discussed:

**Vulnerability 1: Use-After-Free**

*   **Root Cause:** The `hash_destroy` function in `hash.c` frees memory associated with hash entries but doesn't nullify the pointers after freeing, leading to a use-after-free condition. Specifically, the code frees `prev` inside the loop but then accesses it in the following loop.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Use-after-free
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior. The provided Address Sanitizer output shows a heap-use-after-free error, confirming this.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Triggering the `hash_destroy` function with a crafted hash table structure.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need the ability to trigger the destruction of a hash table with specific characteristics that expose the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 2: Out-of-Bounds Read**

*   **Root Cause:** The `get_length` function in `eval.c`, when processing a malformed symbol, attempts to access an out-of-bounds element of a `lisp_cell_t` structure. Specifically, the code accesses `x->p[1].v` without checking if the index is within the valid range of `p`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior. The provided Address Sanitizer output shows a global-buffer-overflow error, confirming this. The read occurs outside the bounds of the '_nil' and '_tee' variables.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Crafting malformed Lisp symbols.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to input malformed symbols that are processed by the vulnerable `get_length` function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub issue details both the use-after-free and out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities, including the affected code lines, example Address Sanitizer outputs, and zip files for reproducing the issues.
*   The reporter suggests a fix for the use-after-free by setting the pointer to null after freeing. For the out-of-bounds read, a bounds check on the array access is recommended.
*   The maintainer acknowledges the issues and indicates that a fix will be merged if a pull request is provided but that a partial fix has been applied.
*  The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description.
