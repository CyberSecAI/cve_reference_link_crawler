### **[Halcy0nic](/Halcy0nic)** commented [Nov 6, 2023](#issue-1979643796)

| Overview Hi there [@howerj](https://github.com/howerj)! I love the library and per usual I ran my fuzz tests in the background and found just a couple of memory corruption bugs in liblisp through [4c65969](https://github.com/howerj/liblisp/commit/4c65969405d38cabb47e7b86eb19232073cdaf7d). I have included all of the files necessary for reproducing each bug. If I get some time I'll work on submitting a pull request.   * Use-after-free in void hash\_destroy(hash\_table\_t \*h) at hash.c, lines 70-84. * Out-of-bounds read in unsigned get\_length(lisp\_cell\_t \* x) at eval.c, line 272.  Use-after-free There exist a use-after-free bug in void hash\_destroy(hash\_table\_t \*h) at hash.c, lines 70-84. I believe a potential fix for this would be to set the pointer 'hash\_table\_t \*h' to null after passing it to 'free'. Source Code    [liblisp/src/hash.c](https://github.com/howerj/liblisp/blob/4c65969405d38cabb47e7b86eb19232073cdaf7d/src/hash.c#L70-L85)  Lines 70 to 85 in [4c65969](/howerj/liblisp/commit/4c65969405d38cabb47e7b86eb19232073cdaf7d)   |  | void hash\_destroy(hash\_table\_t \* h) { | | --- | --- | |  | if (!h) | |  | return; | |  | for (size\_t i = 0; i < h->len; i++) | |  | if (h->table[i]) { | |  | hash\_entry\_t \*prev = NULL; | |  | for (hash\_entry\_t \*cur = h->table[i]; cur; prev = cur, cur = cur->next) { | |  | h->free\_key(cur->key); | |  | h->free\_val(cur->val); | |  | free(prev); | |  | } | |  | free(prev); | |  | } | |  | free(h->table); | |  | free(h); | |  | } |     File for reproduction [uaf-liblisp.zip](https://github.com/howerj/liblisp/files/13270380/uaf-liblisp.zip) Address Sanitizer Output ``` ================================================================= ==134443==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x6080000006a8 at pc 0x7f9da3ee019b bp 0x7ffce0e7abe0 sp 0x7ffce0e7abd8 READ of size 8 at 0x6080000006a8 thread T0     #0 0x7f9da3ee019a in hash_destroy src/hash.c:73     #1 0x7f9da3ee019a in hash_destroy src/hash.c:70     #2 0x7f9da3edf78f in gc_free src/gc.c:50     #3 0x7f9da3edf78f in lisp_gc_sweep_only src/gc.c:124     #4 0x7f9da3ee4011 in lisp_destroy src/lisp.c:80     #5 0x7f9da3ee871e in main_lisp_env src/repl.c:236     #6 0x7f9da36456c9 in __libc_start_call_main ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58     #7 0x7f9da3645784 in __libc_start_main_impl ../csu/libc-start.c:360     #8 0x5615bae755b0 in _start (/home/kali/projects/fuzzing/liblisp/lisp+0x25b0) (BuildId: 0827e7ee54f24ed60d4875e0b6fa13ce80a7782b)  0x6080000006a8 is located 8 bytes inside of 96-byte region [0x6080000006a0,0x608000000700) freed by thread T0 here:     #0 0x7f9da38d7298 in __interceptor_free ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:52     #1 0x7f9da3ee750e in read_hash src/read.c:211     #2 0x7f9da3ee750e in reader src/read.c:279  previously allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x7f9da38d7fa7 in __interceptor_calloc ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:77     #1 0x7f9da3edfe97 in hash_create_custom src/hash.c:57  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free src/hash.c:73 in hash_destroy Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x608000000400: fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 fa   0x608000000480: fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x608000000500: fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 fa   0x608000000580: fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 fa   0x608000000600: fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 fa =>0x608000000680: fa fa fa fa fd[fd]fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd   0x608000000700: fa fa fa fa fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fa   0x608000000780: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x608000000800: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x608000000880: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x608000000900: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb ==134443==ABORTING  ``` Out-of-bounds Read There exist an out-of-bounds read in unsigned get\_length(lisp\_cell\_t \* x) at eval.c, line 272.

| Thanks for the work, I've got other things to do at the moment that are more pressing, but if you manage to make a pull request that fixes these issues I'll merge it. I still haven't got around to looking at the libforth problems just yet. |
