- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of VC6 files. This leads to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation when parsing VC6 files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction. The target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious VC6 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious VC6 file or a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability in the Ashlar-Vellum Graphite software.
