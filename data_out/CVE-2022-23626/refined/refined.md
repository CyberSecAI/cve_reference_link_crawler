Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient error handling in the `image.class.php` file when processing uploaded images. Specifically, the code does not properly check the return values of `imagecreatefrom*` and `image*` functions. These functions can return `false` if they encounter an error during image processing, such as when the provided file is not a valid image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Error Handling:** The core issue is the failure to check if the image processing functions succeeded. The code proceeds even when these functions fail (return `false`).
- **File Upload Vulnerability:** The application retains the original uploaded file on the disk even when the image processing fails, which could be a malicious payload.
- **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type):** This is the identified CWE. The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially upload arbitrary files, disguised as images, which are then not properly validated, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload files of any type (e.g., PHP scripts, malicious code) by disguising them as image files.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a file with malicious code (e.g., a PHP file), the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server if the uploaded file is accessible through a web request.
- **Other Potential Attacks:** Depending on the nature of the uploaded file and the server's configuration, various attacks are possible (e.g., cross-site scripting, information disclosure, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Upload Functionality:** The attack vector is through the file upload mechanism of the application.
- **Malicious Image Files:** An attacker crafts a malicious file disguised as a valid image (or an invalid one that causes `imagecreatefrom*` to fail) and uploads it to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to File Upload Functionality:** The attacker needs to have access to the application's file upload functionality, which is likely available to any user who can upload an image file.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious files that can bypass basic file type checks and trigger the error in image processing.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided commit diff `6f5e59f` in `app/image.class.php` shows an attempt to fix the issue by checking the result of `$imgt($new_image, $thumb_path)` and `$imgt($old_image, $source_path)`. However, the vulnerability lies with how the code handles errors from `imagecreatefrom*` family functions.

- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 1.4. Version 1.4 includes a patch.

- The identified weakness is CWE-434.
