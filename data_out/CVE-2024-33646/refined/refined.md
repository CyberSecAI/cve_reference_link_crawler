- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged users can perform actions that they should not be authorized to do. The specific impact varies depending on the function that is affected.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a function that lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
