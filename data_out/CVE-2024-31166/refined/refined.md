- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `fluid_msg::of13::HelloElemVersionBitmap::unpack` routine of the libfluid library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A network attacker can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the vulnerable component.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable component. No authentication is needed, and it can be performed remotely.
