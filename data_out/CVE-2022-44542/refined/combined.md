The support for perl storable (pst) files was removed for security reasons. The shell scripts do now pass the ShellCheck tests. Adjustments for the recognition of hdf amd matlab files (for newer file command) and language recognition for bat(cat) were done.

| [Description](#c0)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-08-18 02:58:04 UTC  ``` From <https://github.com/wofr06/lesspipe/releases/tag/v2.06>: "The support for perl storable (pst) files was removed for security reasons."  And see <https://github.com/wofr06/lesspipe/commit/a5610c106f38570040de4d76c0ed1c6af74e9a7c>.  No details though. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2022-08-18 03:10:19 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=bb2641741479ad64a0959c6eb3b80c4b6106e056>  commit bb2641741479ad64a0959c6eb3b80c4b6106e056 Author:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2022-08-18 02:58:18 +0000 Commit:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2022-08-18 03:09:57 +0000      app-text/lesspipe: add 2.06          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/865631>     Signed-off-by: Sam James <sam@gentoo.org>   app-text/lesspipe/Manifest             |  1 +  app-text/lesspipe/lesspipe-2.06.ebuild | 52 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  2 files changed, 53 insertions(+) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-25 13:26:05 UTC  ``` Please cleanup ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-10-23 14:51:14 UTC  ``` Upstream pointed me to some references that they were given in the original vulnerability report:     "In lesspipe 2.02, you added support for Perl Storable files using    `perl -MStorable=retrieve`. By design, this function is not secure    against untrusted input, and can be exploited for arbitrary code    execution:     <https://perldoc.perl.org/Storable#SECURITY-WARNING>    <https://www.masteringperl.org/2012/12/the-storable-security-problem/>    <https://twitter.com/dozernz/status/1167226128559263744>"  And from the perl.org link,  "Finally, the deserialized object's destructors will be invoked when the objects get destroyed in the deserializing process. Maliciously crafted Storable documents may put such objects in the value of a hash key that is overridden by another key/value pair in the same hash, thus causing immediate destructor execution."  So this seems like a code execution vulneraiblity. Upstream opted not to make an advisory due to the significant amount of user cooperation required to open a crafted PST. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2022-10-28 19:53:30 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=38bdda86e54a0645a606392dae2ed41c68127c4e>  commit 38bdda86e54a0645a606392dae2ed41c68127c4e Author:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2022-10-28 19:42:52 +0000 Commit:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2022-10-28 19:49:58 +0000      app-text/lesspipe: drop 2.05-r1          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/865631>     Signed-off-by: Sam James <sam@gentoo.org>   app-text/lesspipe/Manifest                |  1 -  app-text/lesspipe/lesspipe-2.05-r1.ebuild | 47 -------------------------------  2 files changed, 48 deletions(-) ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-10-31 15:35:23 UTC  ``` GLSA request filed.
