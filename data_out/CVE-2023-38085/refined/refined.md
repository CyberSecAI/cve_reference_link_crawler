- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JP2 files, which can lead to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for information disclosure. An attacker could also leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction such as visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JP2 file to the user, or have the user visit a malicious webpage that will trigger the vulnerable code.
