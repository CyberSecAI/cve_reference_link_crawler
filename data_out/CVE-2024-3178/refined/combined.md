## Behavioral Improvements

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug where `c5:info` console command would fail when run on a Concrete webroot if that webroot was not yet an installed Concrete site.
* Fixed bug where logout link in toolbar would not work when user was logged in as an editor who could not view the Dashboard (thanks ounziw)

## Security Updates

* Created [CVE-2024-2753](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2753) Stored XSS on the calendar color settings screen and fixed it with [commit 11988](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11988/commits/a3b5dddd26e38a693d4318fd424b3846dbab5826) Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could put malicious javascript on the Concrete CMS color setting screen which would have would have been triggered by and affected users who accessed the color settings screen. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 2.0 with a vector of [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)

  Thank you Rikuto Tauchi for reporting HackerOne 2433383.
* Created [CVE-2024-3178](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3178) Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Advanced File Search Filter and fixed it with [commit 11988](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11988) for version 9 and [commit 11989](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11989) for version 8. Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could add malicious code in the file manager because of insufficient validation of administrator provided data. All administrators have access to the File Manager and hence could create a search filter with the malicious code attached. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L&version=3.1)
  Thank you Guram (javakhishvili) for reporting HackerOne 949443

Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could insert malicious code in the custom class field due to insufficient validation of administrator provided data. Concrete CMS version 9.2.8 and 8.5.13 no longer allow any non alphanumeric characters in this CSS class. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L&version=3.1) Thank you Alexey Solovyev for reporting HackerOne 918129.
* Created and fixed [CVE-2024-3180] (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3180) Prior to fix, stored XSS could be executed by a rogue administrator adding malicious code to the link-text field when creating a block of type file. Fixed with [commit 11988](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11988) for version 9 and [commit 11989](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11989) for version 8. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 sore of 3.1 with a vector of [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L&version=3.1) Thank you Alexey Solovyev for reporting HackerOne 903356
* Created [CVE-2024-3181](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3181) Stored XSS in the Search Field. Prior to the fix, stored XSS could be executed by an administrator changing a filter to which a rogue administrator had previously added malicious code. The Concrete Team fixed this with [commit 11988](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11988) for version 9 and [commit 11989](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11989) for version 8.

## Security Updates

* Created [CVE-2024-2753](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2753) Stored XSS on the calendar color settings screen and fixed it with [commit 11988](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11988/commits/a3b5dddd26e38a693d4318fd424b3846dbab5826) Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could put malicious javascript on the Concrete CMS color setting screen which would have would have been triggered by and affected users who accessed the color settings screen. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 2.0 with a vector of [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)

  Thank you Rikuto Tauchi for reporting HackerOne 2433383.
* Created [CVE-2024-3178](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3178) Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Advanced File Search Filter and fixed it with [commit 11988](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11988) for version 9 and [commit 11989](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11989) for version 8. Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could add malicious code in the file manager because of insufficient validation of administrator provided data. All administrators have access to the File Manager and hence could create a search filter with the malicious code attached. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L&version=3.1)

Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could insert malicious code in the custom class field due to insufficient validation of administrator provided data.
