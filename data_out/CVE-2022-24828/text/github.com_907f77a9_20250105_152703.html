# Missing input validation can lead to command execution via VcsDriver::getFileContent()

Moderate

[Seldaek](/Seldaek)
published
GHSA-x7cr-6qr6-2hh6
Apr 13, 2022

## Package

composer

composer/composer
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<1.10.26 || >=2.0,<2.2.12 || >=2.3,<2.3.5

## Patched versions

1.10.26, 2.2.12, 2.3.5

## Description

The Composer method `VcsDriver::getFileContent()` with user-controlled `$file` or `$identifier` arguments is susceptible to an argument injection vulnerability. It can be leveraged to gain arbitrary command execution if the Mercurial or the Git driver are used.

This led to a vulnerability on Packagist.org and Private Packagist, i.e., using the composer.json `readme` field as a vector for injecting parameters into the `$file` argument for the Mercurial driver or via the `$identifier` argument for the Git and Mercurial drivers.

Composer itself can be attacked through branch names by anyone controlling a Git or Mercurial repository, which is explicitly listed by URL in a project's composer.json.

To the best of our knowledge, this was not actively exploited. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.
