# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1940

## AutomationDirect P3-550E Programming Software Connection Remote Memory Diagnostics Write-What-Where vulnerability

##### May 28, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-22187

##### SUMMARY

A write-what-where vulnerability exists in the Programming Software Connection Remote Memory Diagnostics functionality of AutomationDirect P3-550E 1.2.10.9. A specially crafted network packet can lead to an arbitrary write. An attacker can send an unauthenticated packet to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

AutomationDirect P3-550E 1.2.10.9

##### PRODUCT URLS

P3-550E - [https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/shopping/catalog/programmable\_controllers/productivity3000*plcs*(modular)/cpus/p3-550e](https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/shopping/catalog/programmable_controllers/productivity3000_plcs_%28modular%29/cpus/p3-550e)

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.1 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-284 - Improper Access Control

##### DETAILS

The P3-550E is the most recent CPU module released in the Productivity3000 line of Programmable Automation Controllers from AutomationDirect. It is an affordable control CPU which communicates remotely via ethernet, serial, and USB and exposes a variety of control services, including MQTT, Modbus, ENIP and the engineering workstation protocol DirectNET.

The P3-550E exposes a “Programming Software Connection” service over UDP port 9999 that is used by the engineering workstation software to program and otherwise configure the device. The protocol is not well documented and what information we do have is pieced together from reverse engineering efforts.

Each message of the protocol is prefixed with a 12-byte header containing the requesting client’s IP address and originating port, two 16-bit fields only referred to as ‘GBS’ and ‘IMM’, and is followed by a payload which varies by type of request.

```
 0                               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|              GBS              |          Client Port          |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                           Client IP                           |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|              IMM              |         Undetermined          |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

```

The first byte of the IMM field acts as a function code, dictating which high-level feature set is being requested, and the second byte dictates the exact functionality expected. The protocol format for the remainder of the message is dependent on the `IMM` value.

This vulnerability arises when the first byte of `IMM` is `0x01`, which appears to host a subset of diagnostic features. The function responsible for implementing this feature set is located at offset `0x759d0` and we refer to it as `_DISCOVERY_CALLBACK_1`. Within this function, the second byte of `IMM` is used in a switch-case to identify the exact feature being requested. For this report, we are most interested in the implementation of the handler associated with `IMM[1] = 0xA2`. This function appears to enable arbitrary remote memory write capabilities, but we did not find any features within the engineering workstation software that interacted with it. From reverse engineering, we can identify that this handler expects the following payload format.

```
 0                               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                             Base Addr                         |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|           Chunk Size            |         Chunk Count         |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|              UNK                |            Data             |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                             |
|                                ...                            |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

```

The handler for `IMM = 0x01A2`, located at offset `0x7b2d8`, implements a remote memory write, where arbitrary `data` consisting of `chunk_count`s of `chunk_size` (limited to 1, 2, and 4) are written to memory, beginning from `base_address`. A partial decompilation of this function is included below for reference.

```
int32_t sub_7b2d8(struct packet* pkt)
{
    int result;
    if (sub_7afa4(0xA2, pkt->field_14) != 0) {
      result = 0;
    }
    else {
      uint32_t chunk_count = pkt->chunk_count;
      uint32_t chunk_size = pkt->chunk_size;
      if (chunk_count == 0) {
          result = 0;
      } else {
          if (chunk_size == 1) {
              // [1] Read the destination pointer from the packet
              char* dest = pkt->address;
              char* data = &pkt->data;
              if (chunk_count > 0x400) {
                  result = 0;
              } else {
                  int32_t bytes_rxd = 0;
                  if (chunk_count != 0 && chunk_count > 8) {
                      uint32_t i = ((chunk_count - 1) / 8);
                      if ((chunk_count - 8) > 0) {
                          do {
                              // [2] Begin writing the attacker-provided data into memory at the attacker-provided address
                              bytes_rxd += 8;
                              address[0] = data[0];
                              address[1] = data[1];
                              address[2] = data[2];
                              address[3] = data[3];
                              address[4] = data[4];
                              address[5] = data[5];
                              address[6] = data[6];
                              address[7] = data[7];
                              address = &address[8];
                              data = &data[8];
                              i--;
                          } while (i != 0);
                      }
                      ...
                // The remainder of this function is effectively just the various unrolled loops associated
                // with the varying selections of `chunk_size` and `chunk_count`, showing the same capability
                ...

```

In the above decompilation, we confirm that this endpoint allows an unauthenticated remote endpoint to write arbitrary data to arbitrary memory addresses on the device. An attacker who submits a series of properly formatted requests can use this feature to remotely modify arbitrary memory regions on the device, potentially resulting in arbitrary remote code execution.

An attacker who submits a series of properly formatted requests can use this feature to remotely modify arbitrary memory regions on the device, potentially resulting in arbitrary remote code execution.
