- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Generation of weak and predictable Initialization Vector (IV) in Power Management Firmware (PMFW).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of predictable IVs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with privileges can reuse IV values to reverse-engineer debug data, potentially resulting in information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. A privileged attacker would need to exploit the PMFW by reusing IV values
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs local access and must have system privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
