# Password and fingerprint authentication vulnerabilities of biometric fingerprint USB3.0 memory (NewQ)

High

[BossSecuLab](/BossSecuLab)

GHSA-9fj6-vr9p-px49

## Package

secdiskapp
(x32dbg)

## Affected versions

v1.5.1

## Patched versions

Not patched

## Description

### **Impact**

Password and fingerprint authentication vulnerabilities allow malicious attackers to bypass authentication without the correct password or fingerprint information. Exploiting these vulnerabilities grants administrator privileges to attackers, allowing them to delete registered users or add new ones using administrator functions. Consequently, if malicious attackers register as new users using their authentication information, they can access the secure area within the security USB and engage in malicious activities such as stealing, altering, or deleting stored information.

### **Summary**

The NewQ security USB utilizes fingerprint and password authentication to verify users and grant access only to authenticated users. This safeguards internal data from unauthorized access.

The vulnerability is in the password authentication feature of the management program, which is essential for securing the internally stored USB drives. Attackers can bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges without the correct password.

Exploiting this newly discovered vulnerability allows unauthorized attackers to gain administrator privileges within the management program, enabling them to engage in malicious activities such as deleting registered user information or adding new users. Through such malicious actions, attackers can access data protected within the security USB, which is only accessible to registered users, potentially leading to data theft.

### **Analysis**

Analysis Tool: x32dbg

Analyzed Program: secdiskapp.exe

The analyzed security USB, NewQ 3.0 flash drive, provides a security program capable of registering users through password or fingerprint authentication. To uncover vulnerabilities in password and fingerprint authentication within this program, the program code was analyzed using reverse engineering tools. To locate the functions responsible for authenticating passwords and fingerprints, the "Search for – Current Module – Intermodular calls" feature was utilized to search for "Password" and "Fingerprint." As a result, functions suspected of verifying registered authentication information and inputting authentication information were discovered, as depicted in Figures 1 and 2.

**Figure 1. A sample list of suspected functions to verify password authentication information.**

**Figure 2. A sample list of suspected functions to verify fingerprint authentication information.**

The vulnerability analysis process for each function that performs password authentication and fingerprint authentication is as follows:

***Password Authentication***

A breakpoint was set at the vsVerifyPassword function, which was suspected to verify password authentication information. Subsequently, correct and incorrect passwords were input, and the returned result stored in the EAX register was examined. The outcome, as shown in Figure 3, revealed that a value of 0 was returned for the correct password, while a value of 0xF4B7F7FF was returned for the incorrect password.

[![image](https://github.com/BossSecuLab/vulnerability_Reporting/assets/161022390/1eb8973d-edee-4161-be67-9d323b08ff2b)](https://github.com/BossSecuLab/vulnerability_Reporting/assets/161022390/1eb8973d-edee-4161-be67-9d323b08ff2b)

**Figure 3. An example of the return values suspected to indicate authentication results when inputting correct and incorrect passwords during password authentication.**

Based on these results, after inputting an incorrect password and modifying the value stored in the EAX register, which is believed to indicate authentication results, from 0xF4B7F7FF to 0, corresponding to a successful authentication with the correct password, successful bypassing of password authentication and acquisition of administrator privileges were achieved. This is depicted in Figure 7.

***Fingerprint Authentication***

A breakpoint was set at the vsSetFingerPrintPower function, which was suspected to verify fingerprint authentication and fingerprint information was inputted. The register values were analyzed to locate values referencing authentication information, such as authentication details and results. It was determined that the value of the EAX register was referenced during authentication attempts. A hardware access breakpoint was set at the point indicated in Figure 4.

[![image](https://github.com/BossSecuLab/vulnerability_Reporting/assets/161022390/a872a074-8368-4ef9-a0f3-316b3efda8f6)](https://github.com/BossSecuLab/vulnerability_Reporting/assets/161022390/a872a074-8368-4ef9-a0f3-316b3efda8f6)

**Figure 4. Memory area suspected of being referenced during fingerprint authentication attempts.**

As a result, breakpoints were triggered on the strings "chechk\_zhiwen\_bk" and "chechk\_zhiwen\_lab," which were suspected to represent the authentication results after fingerprint authentication. Based on these results, a search was conducted for the "chechk" string using "Search for – Current Module – String references," and breakpoints were set to locate the code accessing the searched strings. Subsequently, after inputting correct and incorrect fingerprint information, it was observed that inputting incorrect fingerprint data referenced the code at addresses 0xF71C88 and 0xF71CE7. Conversely, the code at addresses 0xF71EE8 and 0xF71F47 was executed when the correct fingerprint information was inputted, as illustrated in Figure 5.

[![image](https://github.com/BossSecuLab/vulnerability_Reporting/assets/161022390/10667608-5220-449e-9e03-f624f4461b28)](https://github.com/BossSecuLab/vulnerability_Reporting/assets/161022390/10667608-5220-449e-9e03-f624f4461b28)

**Figure 5. An example of the code execution flow when inputting correct and incorrect fingerprint information.**

Combining these results, the code responsible for comparing fingerprint authentication information was identified for vulnerability analysis by analyzing the Call Stack when the code at address 0x00F71C88 was executed after incorrect fingerprint data was inputted. As shown in Figure 6, the code responsible for comparing authentication values after fingerprint authentication was discovered.

[![image](https://github.com/BossSecuLab/vulnerability_Reporting/assets/161022390/9fcd5d23-707f-47dc-829a-bc39063069d8)](https://github.com/BossSecuLab/vulnerability_Reporting/assets/161022390/9fcd5d23-707f-47dc-829a-bc39063069d8)

**Figure 6. An example of the suspected code used to compare fingerprint authentication results.**

Based on the observed results, if the correct fingerprint is inputted, a value other than 1 is stored in the EAX register, whereas if the incorrect fingerprint is inputted, the value 1 is stored in the EAX register. Using this information, after inputting an incorrect fingerprint and changing the stored value in the EAX register from 1 to a value other than 1, the code was executed, resulting in the acquisition of administrator privileges, as shown in Figure 7.
