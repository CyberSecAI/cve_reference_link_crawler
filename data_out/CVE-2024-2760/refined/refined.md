Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a kernel memory leak present in the `BkavSDFlt.sys` driver, specifically triggered by the `0x222240` IOCTL code.
- The driver's handling code for this IOCTL leaks the kernel address of a global variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Kernel Memory Leak:** The driver discloses a kernel address, which can be used to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (kASLR).
- **Information Leak:**  The leaked address is of a global variable with a constant offset from the base module, negating the kASLR protection for that module.
-  The IOCTL handler copies the absolute address of a global variable into the output buffer of the IRP object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **kASLR Bypass:** By leaking the address of a global variable, an attacker can bypass kernel Address Space Layout Randomization. This allows an attacker to locate other kernel structures and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Information Exposure:** The leaked kernel address allows for further exploitation by providing an attacker with the base address of a kernel module, which can be used to map out memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered through a local IOCTL call to the `BkavSDFlt.sys` driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:**  An attacker needs to be able to interact with the driver and send the crafted IOCTL request. The report indicates that a local, low privileged user is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Send IOCTLs:** The attacker needs the capability to send the specific IOCTL code (`0x222240`) to the vulnerable driver.

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit is readily available as demonstrated by the provided Proof of Concept (PoC).
- There is currently no patch available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.
