Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterization when handling the `medicine_name` parameter in the `/pms/medicines.php` file of the application. Specifically, the application directly incorporates the user-supplied `medicine_name` parameter into an SQL query without any prior validation or escaping, creating an avenue for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsafe use of the `medicine_name` parameter directly in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful SQL injection attack allows a malicious actor to obtain sensitive information from the server's database. This may include user credentials, patient data, financial records, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/pms/medicines.php` endpoint.
- **`medicine_name` Parameter:** The `medicine_name` parameter within the POST request's body serves as the injection point for the SQL payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** Basic understanding of web application requests and SQL syntax is required to craft a malicious payload.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided proof of concept doesn't indicate any requirement for authentication before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable File:** `/pms/medicines.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `medicine_name`
- **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided POST request demonstrates how to inject malicious SQL code through the `medicine_name` parameter.

medicine_name=22*&save_medicine=
```
In this POC, the attacker injects the value `22*` into the `medicine_name` parameter, which could potentially cause errors, allowing further exploitation.
