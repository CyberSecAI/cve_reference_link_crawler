<p>A denial of service vulnerability exists when Windows Network Address Translation (NAT) on a host server fails to properly validate input from a privileged user on a guest operating system. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server to crash.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who already has a privileged account on a guest operating system, running as a virtual machine, could run a specially crafted application that causes a host machine to crash.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Windows NAT accesses the host.</p>
