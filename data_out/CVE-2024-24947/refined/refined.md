The provided content is related to CVE-2024-24947.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs due to an error in handling memory allocation when setting the current working directory. Specifically, when a memory allocation fails, a `memset` operation is performed using the length of the path, leading to a write out of bounds.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper error handling during memory allocation for the current working directory.
- Usage of attacker-controlled path length in `memset` after memory allocation failure.
- The code attempts to reset a directory field after a failed allocation using a length from the attacker controlled path, causing a write out of bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (system crash) by corrupting heap data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted network packet with a `IMM` value of `0xF` and `IMM[1]` as `0x1` or `0x2`.
- Attacker needs to manipulate resource availability to make memory allocation fail.
- The vulnerability is triggered within the error-handling code of setting the current working directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can send unauthenticated network packets.
- The attacker must be able to cause a memory allocation failure, potentially by manipulating resource availability or limiting heap allocations.
