- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `strcpy_until` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer without checking the length of the input, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow. This function is used to parse newline-delimited parameters from HTTP POST requests. Additionally, `strncpy` is used to copy data into a struct, which can also result in an overflow due to not checking the length of the input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stack-based buffer overflow in the `strcpy_until` function when processing `action` parameter.
    - Stack-based buffer overflow in the `strncpy` calls when writing to the `wrpOpDo_params` structure, specifically for the `profile` parameter on EAP115.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution. An attacker can overwrite the return address, redirecting the program execution flow. In the case of the EAP115, an attacker could gain a write-what-where primitive and craft a more precise attack.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/data/scheduler.association.json` endpoint on the device's web interface. The POST request must include the `action` parameter (for EAP115) or `profile` (for EAP115) with a value exceeding the allocated buffer size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web interface of the vulnerable device. They must also be authenticated to the device's web interface with administrative privileges.
