##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

The EAP225(US) AC1350 Access Point is a wireless access point from TP-Link offering native integration with tp-link Omada Cloud SDN for centralized cloud management and zero-touch provisioning.

The EAP225 and EAP115 Wireless Access Points run various services to manage the access points. One such service is `httpd_portal` on the EAP225 (`httpd` on the EAP115), which listens on ports 80, 443, 22080, 22443, 33443, 44443 and 33080. By default, these services run as the root user. The web interfaces exposes a scheduling facility that allows an administrative user to apply a schedule for when specific managed SSIDs and radios should be enabled. This functionality is exposed via the URI `/data/scheduler.association.json`.

The function assigned to handle POST requests to this URI, named `postScheAssocSsidDataJson`, is located at offset `0x45c8f0` of the binary `httpd_portal` when shipped with v5.1.0 Build 20220926 of the EAP225, and at offset `0x42210c` of the binary `httpd` when shipped with v5.0.4 Build 20220216 of the EAP115. While the names differ between access points, and the underlying HTTP servers are slightly different, these two functions are very similar and indicate they likely have a shared ancestor code base. For the initial portion of this report we will be discussing the function as recovered from the EAP225 firmware.

We are most interested in a function that gets dispatched specifically when the POST param `operation` is any value other than `read` or `load`. When using the web interface to store changes to the scheduling, this value is commonly set to `save`. As we will show below, the value is not very tightly constrained.

```
0045c8f0  void* postScheAssocSsidDataJson(struct request_t** ptrRequest)
0045c8f0  {
0045c914      int32_t inputParameters = 0;
0045c928      int32_t retval;
0045c928      if (arg1 == 0)
0045c928      {
0045c934          retval = -1;
0045c934      }
0045c948      else
0045c948      {
0045c948          struct request_t* req = *ptrRequest;
0045c960          // [1] Extract the `operation` parameter from the POST body
0045c960          char* operation_param = http_get_param(req, "operation");
0045c978          if (operation_param == 0)
0045c978          {
0045c99c              printf("[HTTPSCHEDULE-ERROR], [%s, %d]operations is NULL\n", "postScheAssocSsidDataJson", 0x67a);
0045c9ac              retval = -1;
0045c9ac          }
0045c9d0          else
0045c9d0          {
0045c9d0              // [2] Check if the `operation` parameter is "read"
0045c9d0              int32_t operation_matches_read = strncmp(operation_param, "read", 4);
0045c9dc              int32_t operation_matches_load;
0045c9dc              if (operation_matches_read != 0)
0045c9dc              {
0045c9fc                  // [3] Check if the `operation` parameter is "load"
0045c9fc                  operation_matches_load = strncmp(operation_param, "load", 4);
0045ca08                  if (operation_matches_load != 0)
0045ca08                  {
0045ca5c                      // [4] If `operation` is not "read" or "load" call the vulnerable function responsible for `saving` the schedule
0045ca5c                      _http_wsche_assocSsidBuildJsonTo(req, _http_wsche_saveAssocSsid(req, &inputParameters), inputParameters);
0045ca6c                      retval = 2;
0045ca6c                  }
0045c9dc              }
0045ca08              if ((operation_matches_read == 0 || (operation_matches_read != 0 && operation_matches_load == 0)))
0045ca08              {
0045ca14                  getScheAssocSsidDataJson(arg1);
0045ca24                  retval = 2;
0045ca24              }
0045c9dc          }
0045c9dc      }
0045ca84      return retval;
0045ca84  }

```

An appropriately formatted POST request will be passed into `_http_wsche_saveAssocSsid`, which further extracts the `ssid`, `profile`, `action` and `band` parameters. When configuring schedules for multiple SSIDs, the parameters for each are passed as newline-delimited lists. For example, when scheduling both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to only be enabled on weekdays, the POST request parameters would look like this.

```
operation: save
ssid:      TP-Link_2.4GHz\nTP-Link_5GHz
band:      2.4GHz\n5GHz
profile:   Weekdays\nWeekdays
action:    1\n1

```

We note this only so that the future references to a newline delimeter make sense, although they are not necessary for exploitation of this vulnerability.

Below, is an annotated decompilation of the vulnerable `http_sche_saveAssocSsid` function which is responsible for parsing these parameters and individually saving the configuration for each set of parameters.

```
0045a810  int32_t _http_wsche_saveAssocSsid(struct request_t* req, int32_t* inputParameters)
0045a810  {
0045a810      // [5] Initialize stack variables to store copies of POST parameters
0045a86c      uint8_t ssid_copy[0x21] = {0};
0045a86c      uint8_t profile_copy[0x20] = {0};
0045a88c      uint8_t action_copy[0x4] = {0};
0045a890      uint8_t band_copy[0x8] = {0};
0045a8b0      uint8_t wrpOpDo_params[0x70] = {0};

```

First, several stack variables are initialized. These `_copy` variables will end up holding the individual newline-delimited parameters. `wrpOpDo_params` is a specifically formatted structure that is passed via unix-socket IPC to a binary responsible for the underlying implementation of radio scheduling.

```
0045a8c4      int32_t retval;
0045a8c4      if (inputParameters == 0)
0045a8c4      {
0045a8e8          printf("[HTTPSCHEDULE-ERROR], [%s, %d]input parameters is NULL.\n", "_http_wsche_saveAssocSsid", 0x45c);
0045a8f8          retval = -1;
0045a8f8      }
0045a91c      else
0045a91c      {
0045a91c          // [6] Extract the initial `ssid`, `profile`, `action`, and `band` parameters
0045a91c          char* ssid = http_get_param(req, "ssid");
0045a938          char* profile = http_get_param(req, "profile");
0045a954          char* action = http_get_param(req, "action");
0045a970          char* band = http_get_param(req, "band");
0045a97c          if (ssid == NULL || profile == NULL || action == NULL || band == NULL)
0045a97c          {
0045a9d0              printf("[HTTPSCHEDULE-ERROR], [%s, %d]input parameters is NULL.\n", "_http_wsche_saveAssocSsid", 0x466);
0045a9e0              retval = -1;
0045a9e0          }
0045a98c          else
0045a98c          {

```

At this point ([6]), pointers to the four expected parameters are extracted from the request and their existence is confirmed.

```
0045adfc              // [7] This endpoint is used to update the schedule for multiple radios, so the values for each parameter
0045adfc              //     are expected to be new-line delimited, and this while loop iterates over each set of parameters
0045adfc              while (true)
0045adfc              {
0045adfc                  if (*ssid != 0 && *profile != 0 && *action != 0 && *band != 0)
0045adfc                  {
0045adfc                      // [8] Reset copy buffers for next iteration of loop
0045aa04                      memset(&ssid_copy, 0, 0x21);
0045aa28                      memset(&band_copy, 0, 8);
0045aa4c                      memset(&profile_copy, 0, 0x20);
0045aa70                      memset(&action_copy, 0, 4);
0045aa70
0045aaa8                      // [9] For each parameter, copy from the current offset of `<param>` into `<param>_copy` until a `\n` or `\0` is found.
0045aaa8                      //     Given that `strcpy_until` returns the length of the value copied, the pointer in `param` is updated to point
0045aaa8                      //     to the next value to be handled.
0045aaa8                      //     Observe that there are no limits on the lengths of the value being copied, so overflows are straightforward
0045aaa8                      ssid    = &ssid[strcpy_until(ssid, '\n', &ssid_copy)];
0045aad8                      band    = &band[strcpy_until(band, '\n', &band_copy)];
0045ab08                      profile = &profile[strcpy_until(profile, '\n', &profile_copy)];
0045ab38                      action  = &action[strcpy_until(action, '\n', &action_copy)];

```

The first set of vulnerable function calls appears above, at [9]. A function we refer to as `strcpy_until` copies string data from the first parameter into the third parameter, until either the delimiter character is found or a null-byte is found. This is done without regard for the size of the destination buffer, and at no point is the length of the input checked. Each of the four parameters (`ssid, band, profile, action`) can be individually used to corrupt the stack as a result of the `strcpy_until` calls. `strcpy_until` returns the number of bytes copied, and that value is used to advance the pointer of each parameter to the next potential value in the new-line delimited list.

```
0045ab54                      // [10] Dominating corruptor for `ssid` parameter
0045ab54                      int32_t ssid_len = strlen(&ssid_copy);
0045ab7c                      strncpy(&wrpOpDo_params.ssid, &ssid_copy, ssid_len);
0045ab7c
0045ab7c                      // [11] Dominating corruptor for `profile` parameter
0045aba0                      int32_t profile_len = strlen(&profile_copy);
0045abc8                      strncpy(&wrpOpDo_params.profile, &profile_copy, profile_len);
0045abc8                      ...

```

Of note, the two `strncpy` calls here that populate the `wrpOpDo_params` structure can also overflow, and given that they are located further down the stack than the initial `_copy` variables, they will be the dominating corruptors for the `ssid` and `profile` parameters. The remainder of the function simply passes the constructed `wrpOpDo_params` structure into the IPC mechanism discussed earlier.

An attacker who can successfully submit an authenticated and appropriately malformed POST request to the `/data/scheduler.association.json` endpoint can cause one or more of several buffers to overflow, corrupting the stack and gaining control of code execution.

#### CVE-2023-49910 - EAP115 ssid

At this point, it becomes necessary to discuss the differences between the two different compilations of this function. In the EAP115, the two distinct functions discussed previously were in-lined and are one contiguous function, which slightly alters the layout of variables on the stack. There is also a second and much more significant difference, and that is in how the `ssid` and `profile` variables are copied into the `wrpOpDoParam` structure. In the above instance, references are taken and passed directly into the `strncpy` calls, whereas the EAP115-specific variables are allocated to store these reference pointers. Below is a decompilation of just the distinct portions of the function, as recovered from the EAP115.

```
                                      // [6] Take copies of pointers to the `ssid` and `profile` fields of the `wrpOpDo_params` structure

0042261c                              uint8_t* p_wrpOpDo_profile = &wrpOpDo_params.profile;
00422624                              struct wrpOpDo_param* p_wrpOpDo_params = &wrpOpDo_params;

                                      // [7] This endpoint is used to update the schedule for multiple radios, so the values for each parameter
                                      //     are expected to be new-line delimited, and this while loop iterates over each set of parameters

                                          // [10] Copy the `ssid` and `profile` parameter values into the respective fields of the `wrpOpDo_params` structure

                                          //      Since these pointers point into a structure allocated on the stack, these copies are also buffer overflows
                                          //      and the second strncpy is the dominating overflow, given its position on the stack.

```

Most significantly, the pointers copied at `[6]` are stored into `p_wrpOpDo_ssid` and `p_wrpOpDo_profile`, which are located in the region of the stack following the `wrpOpDo` structure and the `_copy` pointers. This allows for certain interesting attacks, where an attacker can craft a write-what-where primitive by corrupting only the pointers stored in `p_wrpOpDo_ssid` and `p_wrpOpDo_profile`. The string provided in `ssid` or `profile` would then be `strncpy`‘d into the attacker-controlled destination address. It also complicates a succesful corruption of the return pointer. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will either require an info-leak to disclose a writable pointer or a very lucky guess to keep the `strncpy` calls at `[10]` from crashing the process. Corruption of the return address is then possible, potentially resulting in remote code execution.
