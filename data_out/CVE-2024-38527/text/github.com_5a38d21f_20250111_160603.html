# Cross-site Scripting in ZenUML

Moderate

[MrCoder](/MrCoder)
published
GHSA-q6xv-jm4v-349h
Jun 26, 2024

## Package

npm

@zenuml/core
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=3.0.0

## Patched versions

3.23.25

## Description

### Summary

Markdown-based comments in the ZenUML diagram syntax are susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).

### Details

The comment feature allows the user to attach small notes for reference. This feature allows the user to enter in their comment in markdown comment, allowing them to use common markdown features, such as `**` for bolded text. However, the markdown text is currently not sanitized before rendering, allowing an attacker to enter a malicious payload for the comment which leads to XSS.

[zenuml-core/src/components/DiagramFrame/SeqDiagram/MessageLayer/Block/Statement/Comment/Comment.vue](https://github.com/mermaid-js/zenuml-core/blob/dcfee8cde42673c09e19401f43ad8506658c8442/src/components/DiagramFrame/SeqDiagram/MessageLayer/Block/Statement/Comment/Comment.vue#L65)

### PoC

```
// p<img onerror=alert(1) src=""/>
A->B:hi

```

Above is a POC diagram payload that results in an XSS.

Here is a similar POC in mermaid.live: <https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNpNjrFuwyAQhl8F3dRK1DaQGhs1kVq1Y6duFQsylwTVgEWw1MTyuxc5S7df39399y0wRIug4IZh9qMOdU2mF-dPJAZMKaa9GTHlB_ZILmnYa9BQH3R4fTq8qbMDCh6TN86WhkUHQjTkM3rUoEq0Jv2Ui7CWPTPn-HUNA6icZqQwT9ZkfHfmlIwHdTTjpVC0Lsf0eVfazChMJoBa4BdUL6uGC8n7TrCGd5zCFRRnXbVjvBVNK3gJXbtSuMVYSlnFC-Kyf961UshWbmXf2-y_xcf29c7WP2yrVC0>

### Impact

This puts existing applications that use ZenUML **unsandboxed** at risk of arbitrary JavaScript execution when rendering user-controlled diagrams.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
