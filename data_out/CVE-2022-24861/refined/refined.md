Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the application handles JDBC driver loading. Specifically, the application downloads a JDBC driver from a URL provided by the user and then loads the driver class using `URLClassLoader`. This process does not validate the downloaded JAR file, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious JAR file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unvalidated JAR Loading:** The application downloads and loads JAR files from user-specified URLs without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By providing a malicious JAR file containing arbitrary code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application does not validate the content of the JAR file nor the driver class name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could lead to:
    - Data breach or exfiltration.
    - Full compromise of the server and application.
    - Denial of service attacks.
- **System takeover:** An attacker could gain complete control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Extension Configuration:** The attacker manipulates the application by creating a database extension and providing a malicious URL as the "JDBC Driver Download Address."
- **Project Sync:** The attacker then initiates a "Sync" operation within a project using the malicious database extension, which triggers the download and execution of the attacker's crafted JAR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application.
- **Ability to configure database extensions:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges to create or modify database extensions.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs a way to host the malicious jar file and provide a valid URL to it.

**Technical Details and Description**

The vulnerability occurs within the `CustomDatabaseConnectionFactory.java` file, specifically in the `getConnection` method. The method performs the following actions:

1.  Downloads the JDBC driver JAR file from a URL specified in the database type configuration.
2.  Creates a `URLClassLoader` to load classes from the downloaded JAR.
3.  Loads the specified driver class using `Class.forName()`
4.  Instantiates the driver class via `getConstructor().newInstance()`, thereby executing any code within the constructor or static blocks of the provided class.

The vulnerability is triggered when the application connects to a database using an attacker-controlled driver. The attacker provides a malicious JAR file that executes arbitrary code on the server during the class loading or instantiation process.

The fix involved adding the `DriverResources::validateJar` method which validates if the driver class implements the `java.sql.Driver` interface. Additionally, the `JwtTokens` class was modified to use a configurable secret via the `databasir.jwt.secret` property instead of a hardcoded value, and the `resolveDriverClassName` was refactored.
