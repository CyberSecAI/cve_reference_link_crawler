{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The virt_wifi driver's connection code did not check the SSID from user space, only the BSSID, leading to incorrect connection success reports.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of user-supplied SSID during connection attempts."
    ],
    "impact": "The driver incorrectly reports connection success even when the provided SSID does not match the advertised one, leading to issues in cfg80211 and generating a warning due to the inability to find the matching bss.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A user-space application can attempt to connect to a virtual WiFi network using an incorrect SSID."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A user space application capable of initiating a connection attempt with a specific SSID is required to trigger the issue."
