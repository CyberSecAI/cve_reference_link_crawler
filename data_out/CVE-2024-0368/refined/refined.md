Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0368

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of hardcoded HubSpot API keys (specifically, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `HAPIKEY`) directly within the plugin's source code. These keys should have been managed through a more secure mechanism (e.g., environment variables, secure storage) instead of being exposed in the `hustle-hubspot-api.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The hardcoded API keys allow unauthorized access to the HubSpot account associated with those keys.
- **Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** The API keys are not properly secured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), from the connected HubSpot account.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could use the exposed keys to perform actions within the HubSpot account as if they were authorized users.
- **Data Manipulation:** Depending on the permissions associated with the keys, attackers might be able to modify or delete data in the HubSpot account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to Plugin Code:** An attacker can obtain the API keys by examining the plugin's source code, which can be accessed via publicly available plugin repository or directly if the plugin files are exposed.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Once the API keys are obtained, no further authentication is required to interact with the HubSpot API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Access:** The attacker needs access to the plugin's source code. This can be achieved if the attacker can access the plugin files directly on a vulnerable server, or by downloading the plugin from the WordPress plugin repository, if available there.
- **Technical Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to locate the API keys within the code and understand how to utilize them to interact with the HubSpot API.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the "Hustle â€“ Email Marketing, Lead Generation, Optins, Popups" plugin up to and including version 7.8.3.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 7.8.4.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6, indicating a high severity.
- The provided code diff shows the removal of the hardcoded `CLIENT_SECRET` and `HAPIKEY` constants, while keeping the `CLIENT_ID`.
