  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PDF files, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Insufficient data validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted malicious PDF file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file and have the user open it."
