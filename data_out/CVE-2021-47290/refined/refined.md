The provided content relates to a fix for a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the Linux kernel's SCSI target code, specifically during the completion of EXTENDED COPY commands. This vulnerability is addressed by the commit a47fa41381a09e5997afd762664db4f5f6657e03, which is then backported in commit e7732c5a19a15a62b0b23fd683a639b0483e1f40.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the `target_complete_cmd()` function handles CPU affinity for command completion. It relies on the `se_tpg->se_tpg_wwn->cmd_compl_affinity` setting.
- When using LIO's EXTENDED COPY worker, read/write commands are dispatched using the global `xcopy_pt_tpg`, which, after initialization in `target_xcopy_setup_pt()`, carries a NULL `se_tpg_wwn` pointer.
- Consequently, when `target_complete_cmd()` attempts to access `wwn->cmd_compl_affinity`, a NULL pointer dereference occurs if wwn is NULL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- NULL pointer dereference in `target_complete_cmd()`.
- Incorrect handling of the `se_tpg_wwn` pointer within the LIO EXTENDED COPY worker context.
- The code assumes that the `se_tpg_wwn` pointer is always valid, which is not the case for LIO's global `xcopy_pt_tpg`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel panic/crash due to the NULL pointer dereference.
- Potential denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Initiating an EXTENDED COPY command using LIO.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using the libiscsi `SCSI.ExtendedCopy.Simple` test case, demonstrating how a remote initiator could exploit the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to initiate SCSI EXTENDED COPY commands through the target. This requires access to a system that is running the vulnerable target code and an initiator.

**Fix:**
The fix addresses the vulnerability by adding a check for a NULL `wwn` pointer in the `target_complete_cmd()` function before accessing its members:

 		cpu = cmd->cpuid;
 	else
 		cpu = wwn->cmd_compl_affinity;

```
This change ensures that the `cmd->cpuid` is used when wwn is NULL preventing the NULL pointer dereference.
