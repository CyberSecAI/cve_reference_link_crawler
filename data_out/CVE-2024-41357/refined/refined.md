- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `domain_id` and `id` POST parameters when handling PowerDNS record edits. Specifically, the application displays these parameters within a danger message without proper encoding or sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS by injecting malicious javascript within the vulnerable parameters.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie stealing, redirecting users to malicious websites, or other malicious activities.

- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/app/admin/powerDNS/record-edit.php` including a malicious javascript payload in the `domain_id` parameter. The request must also have `action=add` and the `id` parameter should be non numeric.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web application. They must also have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the required parameter structure.
