Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of impersonation within the Task Scheduler service (specifically, the interaction between `taskcomp.dll` and `schedsvc.dll`) when legacy `schtasks.exe` is used. When a user attempts to modify a scheduled task using the legacy `schtasks.exe` (especially setting a "run-as" user), the `taskcomp.dll` component improperly impersonates the Local System account instead of the calling user, before calling the `schedsvc.dll` component to modify the task file. This leads to the Task Scheduler changing the DACL and owner of files as if it was the Local System, instead of the calling user, allowing a low-privilege user to gain elevated privileges on arbitrary files via a hard link trick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Impersonation:** `taskcomp.dll` uses `ImpersonateSelfWithPrivilege` to gain `SeRestorePrivilege`, instead of impersonating the client. This breaks the impersonation chain and causes the subsequent call to `schedsvc!_SchRpcSetSecurity` to run with the `SYSTEM` security token, not the token of the calling user, which bypasses the intended security checks.
*   **Legacy Code Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered by the use of the legacy `schtasks.exe` which interacts with the task scheduler using a legacy RPC interface (`SASetAccountInformation`), resulting in the described improper impersonation.
*   **Hard Link Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited by creating a hard link from a task file to a protected system file (e.g., `pci.sys`). This allows the attacker to change the permissions of the system file by changing the permissions of the hard linked task file, since the system file is impacted by the changes on the task file.
*   **Vulnerable Function:** The `SetJobFileSecurityByName` function within `schedsvc.dll` is vulnerable when called with the `SYSTEM` security token, as it grants permissions on the target file without verifying the caller's authorization with the target file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local, authenticated attacker can escalate privileges from a standard user account to `SYSTEM` level.
*   **Arbitrary File Modification:** Attackers can gain full control over protected files on the system, including system files.
*   **System Compromise:** By modifying critical system files, an attacker can achieve complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the targeted machine.
*   **Legacy schtasks.exe:** The attack is triggered using the legacy version of `schtasks.exe`.
*   **Task Creation/Modification:** The attacker either creates a new scheduled task or modifies an existing one.
*   **Hard Link Creation:** The attacker creates a hard link from the task file to a protected system file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target machine.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to execute code locally on the target machine.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it, including the use of legacy `schtasks.exe` and the hard link trick.
*   **Optional Credentials:** Although the original exploit used a low-privileged user's password, the blog post mentions that the password might not be required for tasks set to run only when the user is logged on.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019.
*   Windows 8 is affected, but exploitation is limited to files where the current user has write access.
*   Windows 7 is not known to be affected.
*   The 0patch team created a micropatch to address this vulnerability by replacing self-impersonation with client-impersonation in `taskcomp.dll` and removing a call to `SetSecurity` in a monitoring thread.
*   Microsoft has released an official fix for this vulnerability, assigned CVE-2019-1069.
