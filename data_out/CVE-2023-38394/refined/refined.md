- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** Not specified, but it involves a function that lacks proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber-level user.
