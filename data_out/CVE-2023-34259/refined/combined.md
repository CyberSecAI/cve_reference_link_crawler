# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Kyocera Document Solutions is leading the digital shift driving productivity
and growth in the printing industry. We offer a range of exciting new options
that draw on the combined resources of the Kyocera Group."

Source: <https://www.kyoceradocumentsolutions.com/en/our-business/inkjet/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends Kyocera customers to install the latest updates.

Furthermore, an in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals
is highly advised, as the software may be affected from other security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Path Traversal - Bypass (CVE-2023-34259)
A path traversal vulnerability was found by Hakan Eren ŞAN in 2020-06-06.
The previous exploit can be found at: <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48561>
Kyocera has fixed the vulnerability. It was not possible to access arbitrary
files using the public exploit. However, SEC Consult have found a bypass to
exploit this vulnerability again and access arbitrary files. Due to the fact
that the web service is running as the user root, it was possible to access all
files (e.g. /etc/shadow) on the device.

2) Denial-of-Service - Web Interface (CVE-2023-34260)
The denial-of-service vulnerability is related to the path traversal
vulnerability. Instead of requesting a file, a directory will be requested.
Once the request is sent to the web service running on TCP port 443, the web
service will become unresponsive and must be restarted.

3) User Enumeration (CVE-2023-34261)
The login function on the web service running on TCP port 443 is prone to a
user enumeration vulnerability. The login function will return different
responses, whether the username is valid or not.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Path Traversal - Bypass (CVE-2023-34259)
Previously, a security researcher has discovered an unauthenticated directory
traversal vulnerability in the web service running on port 443. The following
payload was used to access arbitrary files:

<https://IP/wlmeng/../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00index.htm>

This vulnerability is fixed in the current version. It was not possible to
access arbitrary files using the above payload. However, the vulnerability was
not fixed correctly. SEC Consult identified a bypass to exploit this
vulnerability again.

Once the ../ sequences will be URL encoded, it is possible to bypass the fix
and access arbitrary files. The following payload can be used to access the
file /etc/passwd:

[https://IP/wlmdeu%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc/passwd%00index.htm](https://IP/wlmdeu/../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00index.htm)

The response containing the contents of the file /etc/passwd can be seen
in the following paragraph.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, it was possible to access the file /etc/shadow. The following payload can
be used:

[https://IP/wlmdeu%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc/shadow%00index.htm](https://IP/wlmdeu/../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow%00index.htm)

The output containing the content of the file /etc/shadow as it can be seen in
the following paragraph.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 401
Accept-Encoding: identity
Server: KM-MFP-http/V0.0.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the web service is running as the user root it was possible to access the
/etc/shadow file or the file has set the wrong permissions.

Based on previous security assessments of Kyocera printers, it is likely that
the service is running as the user root.

2) Denial-of-Service - Web Interface (CVE-2023-34260)
To trigger the DoS attack it is sufficient to navigate to the URL:

[https://IP/wlmdeu%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%00index.htm](https://IP/wlmdeu/../../../../../../../../../../../etc%00index.htm)

Once the request is sent to the web service, the web service will become
unresponsive.

This attack is related to the path traversal vulnerability. The difference is
that in this case a folder is requested instead of a file. Apparently, this
leads to an error condition in the web server causing it to be unresponsive for
all users. Other applications offering a web interface (e.g., on port 8083)
seem to not be affected by the attack.

3) User Enumeration (CVE-2023-34261)
The user enumeration is located in the login functionality of the web
interface. Submitting an existing username will result in a different server
response than submitting an incorrect username. This enables attackers to
enumerate existing users by submitting potential usernames till a different
response is gathered. In this case, it does not matter whether the transmitted
password is correct or not. The gathered information could be used to better
search for default passwords or custom passwords inside of public password
leaks.
In case, the username does not exist, the response will return
"Login-Benutzername oder Passwort falsch.", on the other hand, if the
username exists the response contains "Sie können sich nicht einloggen."

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following product has been tested:
* Kyocera TASKalfa 4053ci

All versions older than "2VG_S000.002.561" are vulnerable according to the vendor.
