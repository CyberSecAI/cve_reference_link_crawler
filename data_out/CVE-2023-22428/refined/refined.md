**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege validation in Command Centre Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated operators can modify Division lineage due to insufficient privilege validation.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with low privileges can modify the Division lineage, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over resources within the system. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on integrity (I:H), low impact on confidentiality (C:L) and availability (A:L).

**Attack vectors:** Network access (AV:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges (PR:L). No user interaction is required (UI:N).
