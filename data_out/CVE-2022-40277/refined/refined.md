Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly validate the schema/protocol of URLs present in markdown files before passing them to the `shell.openExternal` function. This allows an attacker to craft malicious links with specific schemes/protocols that can trigger command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate the URLs from markdown files, allowing for arbitrary schemes.
- **Remote Command Execution:** By using specific schemes like `sftp://`, the attacker can force the system to mount a remote location and execute a file (e.g., a `.desktop` file on Linux) located there.
- **Reliance on OS Behavior:** The exploit leverages default OS behavior, such as the execution of `.desktop` files upon mounting in some Linux distributions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the executed command, an attacker could gain full control over the victim's system, steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Markdown File:** The attacker crafts a markdown file containing a malicious link.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker sends this markdown file to the victim, who is tricked into opening it using the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
- **Ability to Create and Send Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious markdown file and send it to the victim.
- **Knowledge of Exploitable Schemes:** The attacker needs to be familiar with schemes and protocols that can trigger command execution on the target operating system.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit specifically uses the `sftp://` protocol to mount a remote location containing a malicious `payload.desktop` file, which executes an arbitrary command.
- The exploit is demonstrated on Xubuntu 20.04, but may work on other OS configurations and distributions where similar behaviours occur when mounting locations.
- The vulnerability was discovered in Joplin version 2.8.8.
- At the time of the advisory, no patch was available.
