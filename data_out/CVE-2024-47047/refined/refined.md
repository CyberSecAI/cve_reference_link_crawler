Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in **TYPO3-EXT-SA-2024-007** which is associated with **CVE-2024-47047**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate the "mail" parameter within the `createAction` function of the "powermail" extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The lack of validation allows an attacker to directly access user-submitted data by manipulating the "mail" parameter, which acts as a reference to the data stored in the database, without authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this IDOR vulnerability to view sensitive data submitted through forms that are persisted by the powermail extension, exposing potentially personal or private information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** The attack is performed over the network without requiring any special access. The vulnerability is accessed through the `createAction` function of the extension.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** No user authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special access is required:** Attackers don't need any privileges or prior access to the system.
*   **Network access:** Attackers must have network connectivity to the target system to manipulate the “mail” parameter in the `createAction` and access the stored data.

**Conditions for Exploitation:**

The vulnerability can only be exploited if all of the following conditions are met:

*   The powermail extension is configured to save submitted form data to the database.
*   The powermail plugin setting “Redirect to any other Page after submit” is not set.
*   The powermail plugin setting “Text on submit page“ contains the variable “{powermail\_all}” or other variables containing sensitive user submitted data.

**More Detail than the CVE description:**

The provided text offers more detailed information than is typically found in a basic CVE description. Specifically, it explains the conditions necessary for successful exploitation including the specific powermail plugin settings that contribute to the vulnerability. Additionally, it clarifies that the “mail” parameter within the `createAction` function is the point of exploitation, and provides an explanation on how this vulnerability results in IDOR.

**Solution:**
The advisory recommends updating to the patched versions of the extension: 7.5.1, 8.5.1, 10.9.1, and 12.4.1
