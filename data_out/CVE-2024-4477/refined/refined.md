The provided content is related to CVE-2024-4477.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "WP Logs Book" does not sanitize and escape log data before outputting it in the admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the log data. This code will be executed when an administrator views the logs in the admin dashboard, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions within the context of the administrator's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious code by entering a script tag as the password during a login attempt.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to know the login page of the vulnerable site.
- An administrator has to view the logs in the admin dashboard for the XSS payload to be triggered.
