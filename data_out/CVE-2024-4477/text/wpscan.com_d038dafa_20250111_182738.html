## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Logs Book <= 1.0.1 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its log data before outputting them back in an admin dashboard, leading to an Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Proof of Concept

1. On the login page, enter any username and for the password enter `<script>alert(1)</script>`
2. As an admin, view the logs at: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-logs-book%2Flogin\_attack\_log and see the XSS
