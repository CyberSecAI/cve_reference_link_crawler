- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The lol-html library can panic when processing certain HTML inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The library is vulnerable to panics triggered by specific HTML inputs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the panic, which causes a crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can provide a specially crafted HTML input to the library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).
