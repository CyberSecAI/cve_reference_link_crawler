- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient encoding of user-controlled inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve the session details of an authenticated user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is located at the `/adive/admin/nav/add` endpoint, where multiple parameters are vulnerable to XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to induce a user to interact with a crafted malicious link or inject the malicious code into vulnerable parameters, and no prior authentication is required (PR:N)
