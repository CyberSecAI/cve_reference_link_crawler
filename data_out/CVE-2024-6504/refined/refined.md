- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Security Console could be overloaded by sending invalid requests at a high rate, causing it to enter an exception-handling logging loop that exhausts the CPU.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of invalid requests leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote threat actors with network access could cause a denial of service by exhausting the CPU on the Security Console, potentially disrupting operations.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access is required for a remote threat actor to send high rate of invalid requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the Security Console.
