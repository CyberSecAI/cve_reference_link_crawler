[InsightVM Recent Releases /](/release-notes/insightvm/) Jul 17, 2024

Jul 17, 20246.6.261
## New

* **Scan Assistant version.** Version 1.3.7.1 of the Scan Assistant is now available. This version updates the GoLang runtime from version 1.21.6 to 1.21.11.
* **Arista fingerprinting.** We added Arista Networks EOS fingerprinting with support for installed hotfixes.
* **Reintroduced vulnerability date.** We added a **Reintroduced** date to disclose when a vulnerability is reintroduced to an asset. This date data can be leveraged with the CSV export feature in the Vulnerability Summary pages and the Asset page. Additionally, the Asset Vulnerability, Asset Service Vulnerabilities, and Asset Vulnerabilities V3 endpoints have been updated to return a **Reintroduced** date for their corresponding vulnerabilities.

## Improved

* **Cisco fingerprinting.** We updated the Cisco AnyConnect fingerprinter for Linux to support Cisco Secure Client.
* **Policy content.** We updated our Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Windows 10 STIG to version 2, release 9.
* **First Found date.** A shortened version of the **First Found** date is now displayed in the Security Console.

## Fixed

* The latest content is no longer prevented from loading if a scan runs for longer than 24 hours.
* An issue that prevented users from reviewing the results of a vulnerability investigation for `dns-kaminsky-bug` has been fixed.
* Extra whitespaces are no longer included in the UUIDs entered into blacklist files.

## Security Updates

* We fixed CVE-2024-6504, a security issue that could have allowed remote threat actors with network access to overload the Security Console by sending invalid requests at a high rate, causing it to enter an exception-handling logging loop that ultimately exhausts the CPU. There is no indication that an attacker could use this method to escalate privilege, acquire unauthorized access to data, or gain control of protected resources. This issue affects all Security Console versions up to and including 6.6.260. If your Security Console currently falls on or within this affected version range, ensure that you update your Security Console to the latest version.
