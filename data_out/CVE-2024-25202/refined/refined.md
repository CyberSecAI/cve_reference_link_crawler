Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-25202:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the search functionality of the PHPgurukul visitor management system version 1.0. Specifically, the search bar within the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This occurs because user-provided input is directly reflected in the application's output without proper encoding or sanitization. The vulnerable files are `search-result.php` and `search-visitor.php`, which process search queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the search query.
*   When a user views the search results, the malicious script executes within their browser.
*   This allows an attacker to potentially:
    *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the web page.
    *   Perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the search bar of the PHPgurukul visitor management system.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious payload (JavaScript code) and inputs it into the search field.
*   When a user performs the search, the vulnerable application renders the attacker's payload, executing it in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application and the search functionality.
*   No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is exploitable by any user who can access the search feature of the application.
*   The attacker does not require any special position and can be an external attacker.

**Additional Details**

*   The provided content also mentions an SQL injection vulnerability in the authentication session. This is separate from the XSS vulnerability described for CVE-2024-25202, but it may also be a vulnerability within the same system.

*   **Payload Example:** The provided payload for the XSS attack is `'"><svg/onload=confirm(/xsss/)>`. When entered into the search field, this JavaScript code will execute, displaying an alert box. This confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability.
