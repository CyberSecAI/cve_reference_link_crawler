    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was introduced in pull request #1063, which aimed to prevent XXE. The fix was implemented by disabling entity substitution and external entity resolution during XML parsing. The issue was inadvertently introduced by setting the `noent` option to `true` in the `xmlParseOptions`, which, contrary to the intention, enabled entity substitution instead of preventing it, thus enabling XXE attacks. This was reverted in version 6.7.1."
