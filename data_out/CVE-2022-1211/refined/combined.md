# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| OS： ubuntu 20.04  Furnace version dev73.  Command: ./furnace -console -vgmout out.vgm poc.fur  [POC.tar.gz](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace/files/8369004/POC.tar.gz)  I use fuzz tests, so I don't analyze these crashes in detail.  I packaged the POC file so you can reproduce the error. |

| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in [tildearrow Furnace dev73](?product.tildearrow:furnace). This affects an unknown function of the component *FUR to VGM Converter*. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a stack-based overflow vulnerability. CWE is classifying the issue as [CWE-121](?vulnerability_cwe.196371 "Cwe"). A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function). This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The weakness was released 04/03/2022. It is possible to read the advisory at [github.com](?advisory_url.196371). This vulnerability is uniquely identified as [CVE-2022-1211](?source_cve.196371 "Cve"). It demands that the victim is doing some kind of user interaction. Technical details are unknown but a public exploit is available.

The exploit is shared for download at [drive.google.com](?exploit_url.196371). It is declared as proof-of-concept.

Applying a patch is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at [github.com](?countermeasure_patch_url.196371).

Entries connected to this vulnerability are available at [VDB-123493](?id.123493), [VDB-128146](?id.128146), [VDB-187493](?id.187493) and [VDB-196755](?id.196755).
