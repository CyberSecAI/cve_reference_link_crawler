{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `nfcmrvl_disconnect` function in the Marvell NFC driver fails to free the `hci_dev` field within the `struct nci_dev` during device disconnection, resulting in a memory leak.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak due to incomplete resource deallocation during device disconnection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion over time, which could potentially result in system instability or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Repeated connection and disconnection of a Marvell NFC device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the connection and disconnection of a Marvell NFC device on the affected system."
