{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the use of uncropped dimensions during RGB to YUV conversion in Codec2BufferUtils.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of cropped dimensions in RGB to YUV conversion can lead to out-of-bounds access or other memory corruption issues.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to local elevation of privilege (EoP).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to have local access to the device to exploit the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires local access to the device, and no additional execution privileges are needed."
