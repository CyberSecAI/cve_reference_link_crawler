**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The core issue is the lack of sufficient checks and sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Language` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable device.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The device can be crashed, leading to an automatic reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface, accessible remotely via the network.
- **Specific Parameter:** The attack is triggered by exploiting the `Language` parameter in HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device's web interface in order to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote, as the attack is carried out via network requests.
