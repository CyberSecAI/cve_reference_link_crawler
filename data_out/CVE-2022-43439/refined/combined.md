SSA-887249: Multiple Vulnerabilities in the Web Interface of SICAM
Q200 Devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.9

2023-06-13
2023-06-13
V1.0

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities were identiﬁed in the webserver of Q200 devices. These include Cross Site
Request Forgery (CSRF), session ﬁxation, missing secure ﬂags in HTTP cookies and memory corruption
issues due to missing input validation that could lead to remote code execution.

Siemens has released an update for POWER METER SICAM Q200 family and recommends to update to
the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

POWER METER SICAM Q200 family:
All versions < V2.70

Update to V2.70 or later version
https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/
view/109743592/
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not access links from untrusted sources while logged in at Q200 devices
• Restrict access to port 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue
of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the
corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by
the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may
be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied,
and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security
measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g.
ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to our operational
guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

POWER METER SICAM Q200 is a multifunctional device for detecting, reporting, and analyzing measured
values and events.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43398

Affected devices do not renew the session cookie after login/logout and also accept user deﬁned
session cookies. An attacker could overwrite the stored session cookie of a user. After the victim
logged in, the attacker is given access to the user’s account through the activated session.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not access links from untrusted sources while logged in at SICAM P850 or SICAM P855 devices

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue
of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the
corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by
the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may
be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied,
and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security
measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g.
ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to our operational
guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM P850 is a multifunctional measuring device used for acquisition, visualization, evaluation and
transmission of electrical measured variables such as alternating current, alternating voltage, frequency,
power, harmonics etc.

SICAM P855 is a multifunctional device used to collect, display and transmit measured electrical variables
such as AC current, AC voltage, power types, harmonics, etc. The measurands and events are collected
and processed according to the Power Quality Standard IEC 61000-4-30.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-40226

Affected devices accept user deﬁned session cookies and do not renew the session cookie after
login/logout. This could allow an attacker to take over another user’s session after login.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-41665

Affected devices do not properly validate the parameter of a speciﬁc GET request. This could allow
an unauthenticated attacker to set the device to a denial of service state or to control the program
counter and, thus, execute arbitrary code on the device.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

9.8
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-141: Improper Neutralization of Parameter/Argument Delimiters

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43439

Affected devices do not properly validate the Language-parameter in requests to the web interface on
port 443/tcp. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to crash the device (followed by an
automatic reboot) or to execute arbitrary code on the device.

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43545

Affected devices do not properly validate the RecordType-parameter in requests to the web interface
on port 443/tcp. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to crash the device (followed by an
automatic reboot) or to execute arbitrary code on the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43546

Affected devices do not properly validate the EndTime-parameter in requests to the web interface on
port 443/tcp. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to crash the device (followed by an
automatic reboot) or to execute arbitrary code on the device.
