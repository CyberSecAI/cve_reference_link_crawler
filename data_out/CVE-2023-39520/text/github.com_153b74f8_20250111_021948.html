## Description

# Cryptomator <= 1.9.2 Local Elevation of Privileges

Product: Cryptomato

Vendor: Skymatic GmbH

Affected Version(s): <=1.9.2

Tested Version(s): 1.9.2

Subject: [Improper Privilege Management - CWE-269](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)

Risk Level: Medium

Solution Status: {{TODO}}

Manufacturer Notification: 2023-08-03

Solution Date: {{TODO}}

Public Disclosure: {{TODO}}

CVE Reference: {{TODO}}

Author: Matthias Zöllner, Cyvisory Group GmbH

## Summary

The MSI installer provided on the homepage <https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/download/1.9.2/Cryptomator-1.9.2-x64.msi> allows LPE for low privileged users, via the repair function.

## Details

The problem occurs, as the repair function of the MSI is spawning an SYSTEM Powershell without the `-NoProfile` parameter. Therefore the profile of the user starting the repair will be loaded.

[![cryptomator_2_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47333109/258156158-a41e1567-d6e2-403c-9f69-ce2e99ffe826.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47333109/258156158-a41e1567-d6e2-403c-9f69-ce2e99ffe826.png)

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

As a low privileged user do the following steps to reproduce.

* Locate the msi installer under `c:\windows\installer\` . You can also bring in a fresh one, as long as the version fits.
* Generate a default profile for the user under `%HOME%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.
* Add execution to the profile, e.g. `Start-Process -FilePath cmd.exe -Wait;`
* Run the located installer with

  `msiexec.exe /fa '.\Cryptomator-1.9.2-x64(1).msi'`
* A SYSTEM cmd will spawn

## Impact

Local Elevation of Privileges. On every machine, where the msi installer still can be found or can be brought to.

## Workaround / Fix

Adding a `-NoProfile` to the powershell should help.
