Remark: Formerly this was a Windows-only release. Due to vulnerabilites of unknown impact in the shipped JDK, we also released it for other systems.

## Changes

### Security Fixes üö®

* Local Privilege Escalation: Windows installers allowed access to admin powershell window ([GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/security/advisories/GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3 "GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3")), reported by [@PfiatDe](https://github.com/PfiatDe)
* Several vulnerabilities in the used JDK, see the [Oracle release notes](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2023.html#AppendixJAVA) for an overiew

As usual, the GPG signatures can be checked using [our public key `5811 7AFA 1F85 B3EE C154 677D 615D 449F E6E6 A235`](https://gist.github.com/cryptobot/211111cf092037490275f39d408f461a).
