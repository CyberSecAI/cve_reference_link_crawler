Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-39520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper privilege management in the MSI installer for Cryptomator versions 1.9.2 and earlier. Specifically, the repair function of the MSI installer spawns a SYSTEM-level PowerShell process without the `-NoProfile` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management):** The installer executes PowerShell scripts with SYSTEM privileges but loads the user's profile.
- The absence of the `-NoProfile` parameter in the PowerShell command within the MSI installer's repair function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** A low-privileged user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This is achieved by crafting a malicious PowerShell profile that gets executed when the installer's repair function runs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **MSI Installer Repair Function:** The vulnerability is triggered when the repair function of the Cryptomator MSI installer is executed. This can be done through `msiexec.exe`.
- **Malicious PowerShell Profile:** The attacker must create a malicious PowerShell profile in their user directory that will execute when the SYSTEM PowerShell instance is launched by the installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privileged User:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user on the system where Cryptomator is installed.
- **Access to the MSI Installer:** The attacker needs access to the vulnerable MSI installer (e.g., by locating it in `c:\windows\installer\` or by supplying a copy).
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to create and modify files within their user profile directory to create the malicious PowerShell profile (`%HOME%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`).

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs because the repair function uses powershell without the `-NoProfile` argument, causing the user's profile to be loaded, where the attacker can define arbitrary commands to be run as SYSTEM.
- The fix is to add the `-NoProfile` argument to the powershell command used in the installer.
- The proof of concept involves creating a PowerShell profile that spawns a command prompt, and then using `msiexec.exe /fa` to trigger the repair function and execute the malicious profile.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the Windows version of the Cryptomator installer.
- The vulnerability was reported by Matthias ZÃ¶llner from Cyvisory Group GmbH.
- The issue is addressed in Cryptomator version 1.9.3 by adding the `-NoProfile` parameter to PowerShell commands executed during the installation/repair process.
