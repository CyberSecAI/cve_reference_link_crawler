Remark: Formerly this was a Windows-only release. Due to vulnerabilites of unknown impact in the shipped JDK, we also released it for other systems.

## Changes

### Security Fixes 🚨

* Local Privilege Escalation: Windows installers allowed access to admin powershell window ([GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/security/advisories/GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3 "GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3")), reported by [@PfiatDe](https://github.com/PfiatDe)
* Several vulnerabilities in the used JDK, see the [Oracle release notes](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2023.html#AppendixJAVA) for an overiew

As usual, the GPG signatures can be checked using [our public key `5811 7AFA 1F85 B3EE C154 677D 615D 449F E6E6 A235`](https://gist.github.com/cryptobot/211111cf092037490275f39d408f461a).

## Description

# Cryptomator <= 1.9.2 Local Elevation of Privileges

Product: Cryptomato

Vendor: Skymatic GmbH

Affected Version(s): <=1.9.2

Tested Version(s): 1.9.2

Subject: [Improper Privilege Management - CWE-269](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)

Risk Level: Medium

Solution Status: {{TODO}}

Manufacturer Notification: 2023-08-03

Solution Date: {{TODO}}

CVE Reference: {{TODO}}

Author: Matthias Zöllner, Cyvisory Group GmbH

## Summary

The MSI installer provided on the homepage <https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/download/1.9.2/Cryptomator-1.9.2-x64.msi> allows LPE for low privileged users, via the repair function.

## Details

The problem occurs, as the repair function of the MSI is spawning an SYSTEM Powershell without the `-NoProfile` parameter. Therefore the profile of the user starting the repair will be loaded.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

As a low privileged user do the following steps to reproduce.

* Locate the msi installer under `c:\windows\installer\` . You can also bring in a fresh one, as long as the version fits.
* Generate a default profile for the user under `%HOME%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.
* Add execution to the profile, e.g. `Start-Process -FilePath cmd.exe -Wait;`
* Run the located installer with

  `msiexec.exe /fa '.\Cryptomator-1.9.2-x64(1).msi'`
* A SYSTEM cmd will spawn

## Impact

Local Elevation of Privileges. On every machine, where the msi installer still can be found or can be brought to.

## Workaround / Fix

Adding a `-NoProfile` to the powershell should help.
