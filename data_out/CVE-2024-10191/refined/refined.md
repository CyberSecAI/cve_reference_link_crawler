Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10191

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `officialremark` parameter, before it's displayed on the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. The specific weakness is the lack of input sanitization leading to reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Integrity: The injected script can manipulate the content of the web page, potentially modifying or defacing it for other users.
- The XSS could be used to steal user session cookies, leading to account takeover.
- An attacker could redirect users to malicious sites or perform actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `officialremark` parameter of the `book-details.php` file in the admin panel of the Boat Booking System.
- The attacker crafts a malicious string (e.g., `<IMG """"><SCRIPT>alert("Test")</SCRIPT>">`) and injects it into the `officialremark` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the Boat Booking System to modify booking details.
- They must be able to manipulate the `officialremark` input field in the `book-details.php` page.
- No other specific privileges are mentioned, although access to the admin panel implies some level of authorized access.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The provided XSS payload is: `%3cIMG%20%22%22%22%3e%3cSCRIPT%3ealert(%22Test%22)%3c%2fSCRIPT%3e%22%3e` which decodes to `<IMG """"><SCRIPT>alert("Test")</SCRIPT>">`.
- The vulnerability is present in `book-details.php` and is a reflected XSS vulnerability because the malicious input is reflected back to the user.
- The application does not sanitize or validate the `officialremark` input.

In summary, the vulnerability is a reflected XSS in the admin panel of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System due to the application not sanitizing the `officialremark` input field, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
