- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Layer Slider plugin for WordPress lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a logged-in, higher-privileged user into submitting the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with higher privileges into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
