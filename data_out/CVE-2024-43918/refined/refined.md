Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw in the WordPress WBW Product Table PRO plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary weakness is a **SQL Injection vulnerability**. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful SQL Injection attack can allow an attacker to directly interact with the database. This interaction could include:
    - **Stealing sensitive information** stored in the database.
    - Potentially **modifying or deleting data**.
    - Possibly gaining further access or control of the application depending on the database permissions and other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable WordPress plugin, specifically the WBW Product Table PRO plugin. The vulnerability exists in how the plugin handles user input when constructing SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any authentication. They can exploit the vulnerability **unauthenticated**.
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the vulnerable plugin that includes the malicious SQL injection payload.
- The attacker does not require a privileged position.
