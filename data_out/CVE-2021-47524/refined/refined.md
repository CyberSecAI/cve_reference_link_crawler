The provided content describes a fix for a minor-number leak in the `liteuart` driver in the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `liteuart` driver, when failing during the probe, could return an error without releasing the allocated minor number. This resulted in a minor-number leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Minor number leak:  The driver did not properly handle errors during the probe process, which lead to the allocation of a minor number that was never released.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Repeated probe failures could lead to exhaustion of available minor numbers, potentially causing denial of service by preventing other devices from being allocated a minor number.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could trigger probe errors by various means depending on the system's specific hardware and configuration, potentially causing the driver to fail during initialization and leaking the minor number.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would require the ability to trigger a probe error in the `liteuart` driver. This usually implies some level of control over the hardware or software configuration of the system or possibly through hardware manipulation to induce errors during device initialization.
