| Bug reportBug description: Judging by what the `is_private` and `is_global` implementations in the `ipaddress` module do[1], everything that IANA special-purpose address registries[2][3] considers globally reachable should result in `is_global == True`, the rest should be `is_global = True`.  `is_private` is almost always the opposite of `is_global` (`100.64.0.0/10` is special).  The problem is the ranges present in the code (in the `_private_networks` variables) are not quite right:   * There are some ranges missing (so we incorrectly treat them as globally reachable) * Some of the ranges fail to account for more specific allocations defined as globally reachable (so we incorrectly treat them as not globally reachable)   This is what I have right now and I'll submit that as a PR:  ``` diff --git a/Lib/ipaddress.py b/Lib/ipaddress.py index 5b5520b92bde..3ee565bcd30b 100644 --- a/Lib/ipaddress.py +++ b/Lib/ipaddress.py @@ -1558,13 +1558,18 @@ class _IPv4Constants:        _public_network = IPv4Network('100.64.0.0/10')   +    # Not globally reachable address blocks listed on +    # https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml      _private_networks = [          IPv4Network('0.0.0.0/8'),          IPv4Network('10.0.0.0/8'), +        # 100.64.0.0/10 missing          IPv4Network('127.0.0.0/8'),          IPv4Network('169.254.0.0/16'),          IPv4Network('172.16.0.0/12'), +        # Incomplete.

The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
globally reachable by the IANA registries).

This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
incorrect.

A _address_exclude_many() helper function is created to calculate
the necessary network ranges in the trickier cases.

I left 100.64.0.0/10 alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1]
and I'm not sure if we want to undo that as I don't quite understand the
motivation behind it.

Additionally I mainly focused on adding tests for IP*Address.is_global
and I left IP*Network.is_global alone. The reasons for that are:

* I don't think it makes much sense to have properties like is_global,
  is_private etc. on networks, where there are more than two
  possibilities (can be global, can be non-global, can be partially global).
* The properties aren't documented for network objects in the first
  place so it's unclear what the semantics are

The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
globally reachable by the IANA registries).

This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
incorrect.

I left 100.64.0.0/10 alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1]
and I'm not sure if we want to undo that as I don't quite understand the
motivation behind it.

The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
networks for IPv6.

    gh-117303: Don't detach in `PyThreadState_DeleteCurrent()` (#117304)

    This fixes a crash in `test_threading.test_reinit_tls_after_fork()` when
    running with the GIL disabled. We already properly handle the case where
    the thread state is `_Py_THREAD_ATTACHED` in `tstate_delete_common()` --
    we just need to remove an assertion.

    Keeping the thread attached means that a stop-the-world pause, such as
    for a `fork()`, won't commence until we remove our thread state from the
    interpreter's linked list. This prevents a crash when the child process
    tries to clean up the dead thread states.

    gh-117348: Refactored RawConfigParser._read for similicity and comprehensibility (#117372)

    * Extract method for _read_inner, reducing complexity and indentation by 1.

    * Extract method for _raise_all and yield ParseErrors from _read_inner.

    Reduces complexity by 1 and reduces touch points for handling errors in _read_inner.

    * Prefer iterators to splat expansion and literal indexing.

    * Extract method for _strip_comments. Reduces complexity by 7.

    * Model the file lines in a class to encapsulate the comment status and cleaned value.

    * Encapsulate the read state as a dataclass

    * Extract _handle_continuation_line and _handle_rest methods. Reduces complexity by 8.

    * Reindent

    * At least for now, collect errors in the ReadState

    * Check for missing section header separately.

    * Extract methods for _handle_header and _handle_option. Reduces complexity by 6.

    * Remove unreachable code. Reduces complexity by 4.

    * Remove unreachable branch

    * Handle error condition early. Reduces complexity by 1.

    * Add blurb

    * Move _raise_all to ParsingError, as its behavior is most closely related to the exception class and not the reader.

    * Split _strip* into separate methods.

    * Refactor _strip_full to compute the strip just once and use 'not any' to determine the factor.

    * Replace use of 'sys.maxsize' with direct computation of the stripped value.

    * Extract has_comments as a dynamic property.

    * Implement clean as a cached property.

    * Model comment prefixes in the RawConfigParser within a prefixes namespace.

    * Use a regular expression to search for the first match.

    Avoids mutating variables and tricky logic and over-computing all of the starts when only the first is relevant.

    gh-117300: Use stop the world to make `sys._current_frames` and `sys._current_exceptions` thread-safe. (#117301)

    This adds a stop the world pause to make the two functions thread-safe
    when the GIL is disabled in the free-threaded build.

    Additionally, the main test thread may call `sys._current_exceptions()` as
    soon as `g_raised.set()` is called. The background thread may not yet reach
    the `leave_g.wait()` line.

    gh-111926: Avoid locking in PyType_IsSubtype (#117275)

    Read the MRO in a thread-unsafe way in `PyType_IsSubtype` to avoid locking. Fixing this is tracked in #117306.

    The motivation for this change is in support of making weakrefs thread-safe in free-threaded builds:

    `WeakValueDictionary` uses a special dictionary function, `_PyDict_DelItemIf`
    to remove dead weakrefs from the dictionary. `_PyDict_DelItemIf` removes a key
    if a user supplied predicate evaluates to true for the value associated with
    the key. Crucially for the `WeakValueDictionary` use case, the predicate
    evaluation + deletion sequence is atomic, provided that the predicate doesn’t
    suspend. The predicate used by `WeakValueDictionary` includes a subtype check,
    which we must ensure doesn't suspend in free-threaded builds.

    gh-117344: Skip flaky tests in free-threaded build (#117355)

    The tests are not reliable with the GIL disabled. In theory, they can
    fail with the GIL enabled too, but the failures are much more likely
    with the GIL disabled.

    gh-112529: Don't untrack tuples or dicts with zero refcount (#117370)

    The free-threaded GC sometimes sees objects with zero refcount. This can
    happen due to the delay in merging biased reference counting fields,
    and, in the future, due to deferred reference counting. We should not
    untrack these objects or they will never be collected.

    This fixes the refleaks in the free-threaded build.

    * Reads zip64 files as produced by the zipfile module
    * Include tests (somewhat slow, however, because of the need to create \"large\" zips)
    * About the same amount of strictness reading invalid zip files as zipfile has
    * Still works on files with prepended data (like pex)

    There are a lot more test cases at https://github.com/thatch/zipimport64/ that give me confidence that this works for real-world files.

    Fixes #89739 and #77140.

    gh-115627: Fix PySSL_SetError handling SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL (GH-115628)

    Python 3.10 changed from using SSL_write() and SSL_read() to SSL_write_ex() and
    SSL_read_ex(), but did not update handling of the return value.

    Change error handling so that the return value is not examined.
    OSError (not EOF) is now returned when retval is 0.

    According to *recent* man pages of all functions for which we call
    PySSL_SetError, (in OpenSSL 3.0 and 1.1.1), their return value should
    be used to determine whether an error happened (i.e. if PySSL_SetError
    should be called), but not what kind of error happened (so,
    PySSL_SetError shouldn't need retval). To get the error,
    we need to use SSL_get_error.

    GH-113171: Fix \"private\" (non-global) IP address ranges (GH-113179)

    * GH-113171: Fix \"private\" (really non-global) IP address ranges

    The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
    implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
    overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
    globally reachable by the IANA registries).

    This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
    incorrect.

    I left 100.64.0.0/10 alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1]
    and I'm not sure if we want to undo that as I don't quite understand the
    motivation behind it.

    The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
    networks for IPv6.

    GH-116939: Rewrite binarysort() (#116940)

    Rewrote binarysort() for clarity.

    Also changed the signature to be more coherent (it was mixing sortslice with raw pointers).

    No change in method or functionality. However, I left some experiments in, disabled for now
    via `#if` tricks. Since this code was first written, some kinds of comparisons have gotten
    enormously faster (like for lists of floats), which changes the tradeoffs.

    For example, plain insertion sort's simpler innermost loop and highly predictable branches
    leave it very competitive (even beating, by a bit) binary insertion when comparisons are
    very cheap, despite that it can do many more compares. And it wins big on runs that
    are already sorted (moving the next one in takes only 1 compare then).

    So I left code for a plain insertion sort, to make future experimenting easier.

    Also made the maximum value of minrun a `#define` (``MAX_MINRUN`) to make
    experimenting with that easier too.

    And another bit of `#if``-disabled code rewrites binary insertion's innermost loop to
    remove its unpredictable branch. Surprisingly, this doesn't really seem to help
    overall. I'm unclear on why not. It certainly adds more instructions, but they're very
    simple, and it's hard to be believe they cost as much as a branch miss.

    gh-105716: Fix _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() For Embedders (gh-117140)

    When I added _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() and friends last year, I tried to accommodate applications that embed Python but don't call _PyInterpreterState_SetRunningMain() (not that they're expected to).  That mostly worked fine until my recent changes in gh-117049, where the subtleties with the fallback code led to failures; the change ended up breaking test_tools.test_freeze, which exercises a basic embedding situation.

    The simplest fix is to drop the fallback code I originally added to _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() (and later to _PyThreadState_IsRunningMain()).  I've kept the fallback in the _xxsubinterpreters module though.  I've also updated Py_FrozenMain() to call _PyInterpreterState_SetRunningMain().

    gh-117045: Add code object to function version cache (#117028)

    Changes to the function version cache:

    - In addition to the function object, also store the code object,
      and allow the latter to be retrieved even if the function has been evicted.
    - Stop assigning new function versions after a critical attribute (e.g. `__code__`)
      has been modified; the version is permanently reset to zero in this case.
    - Changes to `__annotations__` are no longer considered critical. (This fixes gh-109998.)

    Changes to the Tier 2 optimization machinery:

    - If we cannot map a function version to a function, but it is still mapped to a code object,
      we continue projecting the trace.
      The operand of the `_PUSH_FRAME` and `_POP_FRAME` opcodes can be either NULL,
      a function object, or a code object with the lowest bit set.

    This allows us to trace through code that calls an ephemeral function,
    i.e., a function that may not be alive when we are constructing the executor,
    e.g. a generator expression or certain nested functions.
    We will lose globals removal inside such functions,
    but we can still do other peephole operations
    (and even possibly [call inlining](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116290),
    if we decide to do it), which only need the code object.
    As before, if we cannot retrieve the code object from the cache, we stop projecting.

    gh-116333: Relax error string text expectations in SSL-related tests (GH-116334)

    * Relax error string text expectations in SSL-related tests

    As suggested [here][1], this change relaxes the OpenSSL error string
    text expectations in a number of tests. This was specifically done in
    support of more easily building CPython [AWS-LC][2], but because AWS-LC
    is a fork of [BoringSSL][3], it should increase compatibility with that
    library as well.

    In addition to the error string relaxations, we also add some guards
    around the `tls-unique` channel binding being used with TLSv1.3, as that
    feature (described in [RFC 6929][4]) is [not defined][5] for TLSv1.3.

    Split `_PyThreadState_DeleteExcept` into two functions:

    - `_PyThreadState_RemoveExcept` removes all thread states other than one
      passed as an argument. It returns the removed thread states as a
      linked list.

    - `_PyThreadState_DeleteList` deletes those dead thread states. It may
      call destructors, so we want to \"start the world\" before calling
      `_PyThreadState_DeleteList` to avoid potential deadlocks.

    gh-116522: Stop the world before fork() and during shutdown (#116607)

    This changes the free-threaded build to perform a stop-the-world pause
    before deleting other thread states when forking and during shutdown.
    This fixes some crashes when using multiprocessing and during shutdown
    when running with `PYTHON_GIL=0`.

    This also changes `PyOS_BeforeFork` to acquire the runtime lock
    (i.e., `HEAD_LOCK(&_PyRuntime)`) before forking to ensure that data
    protected by the runtime lock (and not just the GIL or stop-the-world)
    is in a consistent state before forking.

    gh-114314: ctypes: remove stgdict and switch to heap types (GH-116458)

    Before this change, ctypes classes used a custom dict subclass, `StgDict`,
    as their `tp_dict`. This acts like a regular dict but also includes extra information
    about the type.

    This replaces stgdict by `StgInfo`, a C struct on the type, accessed by
    `PyObject_GetTypeData()` (PEP-697).
    All usage of `StgDict` (mainly variables named `stgdict`, `dict`, `edict` etc.) is
    converted to `StgInfo` (named `stginfo`, `info`, `einfo`, etc.).
    Where the dict is actually used for class attributes (as a regular PyDict), it's now
    called `attrdict`.

    This change -- not overriding `tp_dict` -- is made to make me comfortable with
    the next part of this PR: moving the initialization logic from `tp_new` to `tp_init`.

    The `StgInfo` is set up in `__init__` of each class, with a guard that prevents
    calling `__init__` more than once. Note that abstract classes (like `Array` or
    `Structure`) are created using `PyType_FromMetaclass` and do not have
    `__init__` called.
    Previously, this was done in `__new__`, which also wasn't called for abstract
    classes.
    Since `__init__` can be called from Python code or skipped, there is a tested
    guard to ensure `StgInfo` is initialized exactly once before it's used.

    can read (atomically) from `calls_to_do` without holding `pending->mutex`.

    gh-117303: Don't detach in `PyThreadState_DeleteCurrent()` (#117304)

    This fixes a crash in `test_threading.test_reinit_tls_after_fork()` when
    running with the GIL disabled. We already properly handle the case where
    the thread state is `_Py_THREAD_ATTACHED` in `tstate_delete_common()` --
    we just need to remove an assertion.

    Keeping the thread attached means that a stop-the-world pause, such as
    for a `fork()`, won't commence until we remove our thread state from the
    interpreter's linked list. This prevents a crash when the child process
    tries to clean up the dead thread states.

    gh-117348: Refactored RawConfigParser._read for similicity and comprehensibility (#117372)

    * Extract method for _read_inner, reducing complexity and indentation by 1.

    * Extract method for _raise_all and yield ParseErrors from _read_inner.

    Reduces complexity by 1 and reduces touch points for handling errors in _read_inner.

    * Prefer iterators to splat expansion and literal indexing.

    * Extract method for _strip_comments. Reduces complexity by 7.

    * Model the file lines in a class to encapsulate the comment status and cleaned value.

    * Encapsulate the read state as a dataclass

    * Extract _handle_continuation_line and _handle_rest methods. Reduces complexity by 8.

    * Reindent

    * At least for now, collect errors in the ReadState

    * Check for missing section header separately.

    * Extract methods for _handle_header and _handle_option. Reduces complexity by 6.

    * Remove unreachable code. Reduces complexity by 4.

    * Remove unreachable branch

    * Handle error condition early. Reduces complexity by 1.

    * Add blurb

    * Move _raise_all to ParsingError, as its behavior is most closely related to the exception class and not the reader.

    * Split _strip* into separate methods.

    * Refactor _strip_full to compute the strip just once and use 'not any' to determine the factor.

    * Replace use of 'sys.maxsize' with direct computation of the stripped value.

    * Extract has_comments as a dynamic property.

    * Implement clean as a cached property.

    * Model comment prefixes in the RawConfigParser within a prefixes namespace.

    * Use a regular expression to search for the first match.

    Avoids mutating variables and tricky logic and over-computing all of the starts when only the first is relevant.

    gh-117300: Use stop the world to make `sys._current_frames` and `sys._current_exceptions` thread-safe. (#117301)

    This adds a stop the world pause to make the two functions thread-safe
    when the GIL is disabled in the free-threaded build.

    Additionally, the main test thread may call `sys._current_exceptions()` as
    soon as `g_raised.set()` is called. The background thread may not yet reach
    the `leave_g.wait()` line.

    gh-111926: Avoid locking in PyType_IsSubtype (#117275)

    Read the MRO in a thread-unsafe way in `PyType_IsSubtype` to avoid locking. Fixing this is tracked in #117306.

    The motivation for this change is in support of making weakrefs thread-safe in free-threaded builds:

    `WeakValueDictionary` uses a special dictionary function, `_PyDict_DelItemIf`
    to remove dead weakrefs from the dictionary. `_PyDict_DelItemIf` removes a key
    if a user supplied predicate evaluates to true for the value associated with
    the key. Crucially for the `WeakValueDictionary` use case, the predicate
    evaluation + deletion sequence is atomic, provided that the predicate doesn’t
    suspend. The predicate used by `WeakValueDictionary` includes a subtype check,
    which we must ensure doesn't suspend in free-threaded builds.

    with the GIL disabled.

    gh-112529: Don't untrack tuples or dicts with zero refcount (#117370)

    The free-threaded GC sometimes sees objects with zero refcount. This can
    happen due to the delay in merging biased reference counting fields,
    and, in the future, due to deferred reference counting. We should not
    untrack these objects or they will never be collected.

    This fixes the refleaks in the free-threaded build.

    Remove extra self DECREF on ssl "no ciphers" error path.

    This doesn't come up in practice because nobody links against a broken
    OpenSSL library that provides nothing.

    gh-89739: gh-77140: Support zip64 in zipimport (GH-94146)

    * Reads zip64 files as produced by the zipfile module
    * Include tests (somewhat slow, however, because of the need to create "large" zips)
    * About the same amount of strictness reading invalid zip files as zipfile has
    * Still works on files with prepended data (like pex)

    There are a lot more test cases at https://github.com/thatch/zipimport64/ that give me confidence that this works for real-world files.

    Fixes #89739 and #77140.

    gh-115627: Fix PySSL_SetError handling SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL (GH-115628)

    Python 3.10 changed from using SSL_write() and SSL_read() to SSL_write_ex() and
    SSL_read_ex(), but did not update handling of the return value.

    Change error handling so that the return value is not examined.
    OSError (not EOF) is now returned when retval is 0.

    According to *recent* man pages of all functions for which we call
    PySSL_SetError, (in OpenSSL 3.0 and 1.1.1), their return value should
    be used to determine whether an error happened (i.e. if PySSL_SetError
    should be called), but not what kind of error happened (so,
    PySSL_SetError shouldn't need retval). To get the error,
    we need to use SSL_get_error.

    GH-113171: Fix "private" (non-global) IP address ranges (GH-113179)

    * GH-113171: Fix "private" (really non-global) IP address ranges

    The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
    implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
    overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
    globally reachable by the IANA registries).

    This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
    incorrect.

    I left 100.64.0.0/10 alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1]
    and I'm not sure if we want to undo that as I don't quite understand the
    motivation behind it.

    The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
    networks for IPv6.

    GH-116939: Rewrite binarysort() (#116940)

    Rewrote binarysort() for clarity.

    Also changed the signature to be more coherent (it was mixing sortslice with raw pointers).

    No change in method or functionality. However, I left some experiments in, disabled for now
    via `#if` tricks. Since this code was first written, some kinds of comparisons have gotten
    enormously faster (like for lists of floats), which changes the tradeoffs.

    For example, plain insertion sort's simpler innermost loop and highly predictable branches
    leave it very competitive (even beating, by a bit) binary insertion when comparisons are
    very cheap, despite that it can do many more compares. And it wins big on runs that
    are already sorted (moving the next one in takes only 1 compare then).

    So I left code for a plain insertion sort, to make future experimenting easier.

    Also made the maximum value of minrun a `#define` (``MAX_MINRUN`) to make
    experimenting with that easier too.

    And another bit of `#if``-disabled code rewrites binary insertion's innermost loop to
    remove its unpredictable branch. Surprisingly, this doesn't really seem to help
    overall. I'm unclear on why not. It certainly adds more instructions, but they're very
    simple, and it's hard to be believe they cost as much as a branch miss.

    gh-105716: Fix _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() For Embedders (gh-117140)

    When I added _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() and friends last year, I tried to accommodate applications that embed Python but don't call _PyInterpreterState_SetRunningMain() (not that they're expected to).  That mostly worked fine until my recent changes in gh-117049, where the subtleties with the fallback code led to failures; the change ended up breaking test_tools.test_freeze, which exercises a basic embedding situation.

    The simplest fix is to drop the fallback code I originally added to _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() (and later to _PyThreadState_IsRunningMain()).  I've kept the fallback in the _xxsubinterpreters module though.  I've also updated Py_FrozenMain() to call _PyInterpreterState_SetRunningMain().

    gh-117045: Add code object to function version cache (#117028)

    Changes to the function version cache:

    - In addition to the function object, also store the code object,
      and allow the latter to be retrieved even if the function has been evicted.
    - Stop assigning new function versions after a critical attribute (e.g. `__code__`)
      has been modified; the version is permanently reset to zero in this case.
    - Changes to `__annotations__` are no longer considered critical. (This fixes gh-109998.)

    Changes to the Tier 2 optimization machinery:

    - If we cannot map a function version to a function, but it is still mapped to a code object,
      we continue projecting the trace.
      The operand of the `_PUSH_FRAME` and `_POP_FRAME` opcodes can be either NULL,
      a function object, or a code object with the lowest bit set.

    This allows us to trace through code that calls an ephemeral function,
    i.e., a function that may not be alive when we are constructing the executor,
    e.g. a generator expression or certain nested functions.
    We will lose globals removal inside such functions,
    but we can still do other peephole operations
    (and even possibly [call inlining](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116290),
    if we decide to do it), which only need the code object.
    As before, if we cannot retrieve the code object from the cache, we stop projecting.

    gh-116333: Relax error string text expectations in SSL-related tests (GH-116334)

    * Relax error string text expectations in SSL-related tests

    As suggested [here][1], this change relaxes the OpenSSL error string
    text expectations in a number of tests. This was specifically done in
    support of more easily building CPython [AWS-LC][2], but because AWS-LC
    is a fork of [BoringSSL][3], it should increase compatibility with that
    library as well.

    In addition to the error string relaxations, we also add some guards
    around the `tls-unique` channel binding being used with TLSv1.3, as that
    feature (described in [RFC 6929][4]) is [not defined][5] for TLSv1.3.

    Split `_PyThreadState_DeleteExcept` into two functions:

    - `_PyThreadState_RemoveExcept` removes all thread states other than one
      passed as an argument. It returns the removed thread states as a
      linked list.

    - `_PyThreadState_DeleteList` deletes those dead thread states. It may
      call destructors, so we want to "start the world" before calling
      `_PyThreadState_DeleteList` to avoid potential deadlocks.

    gh-116522: Stop the world before fork() and during shutdown (#116607)

    This changes the free-threaded build to perform a stop-the-world pause
    before deleting other thread states when forking and during shutdown.
    This fixes some crashes when using multiprocessing and during shutdown
    when running with `PYTHON_GIL=0`.

    This also changes `PyOS_BeforeFork` to acquire the runtime lock
    (i.e., `HEAD_LOCK(&_PyRuntime)`) before forking to ensure that data
    protected by the runtime lock (and not just the GIL or stop-the-world)
    is in a consistent state before forking.

    gh-114314: ctypes: remove stgdict and switch to heap types (GH-116458)

    Before this change, ctypes classes used a custom dict subclass, `StgDict`,
    as their `tp_dict`. This acts like a regular dict but also includes extra information
    about the type.

    This replaces stgdict by `StgInfo`, a C struct on the type, accessed by
    `PyObject_GetTypeData()` (PEP-697).
    All usage of `StgDict` (mainly variables named `stgdict`, `dict`, `edict` etc.) is
    converted to `StgInfo` (named `stginfo`, `info`, `einfo`, etc.).
    Where the dict is actually used for class attributes (as a regular PyDict), it's now
    called `attrdict`.

    This change -- not overriding `tp_dict` -- is made to make me comfortable with
    the next part of this PR: moving the initialization logic from `tp_new` to `tp_init`.

    The `StgInfo` is set up in `__init__` of each class, with a guard that prevents
    calling `__init__` more than once. Note that abstract classes (like `Array` or
    `Structure`) are created using `PyType_FromMetaclass` and do not have
    `__init__` called.
    Previously, this was done in `__new__`, which also wasn't called for abstract
    classes.
    Since `__init__` can be called from Python code or skipped, there is a tested
    guard to ensure `StgInfo` is initialized exactly once before it's used.

    gh-117303: Don't detach in `PyThreadState_DeleteCurrent()` (#117304)

    This fixes a crash in `test_threading.test_reinit_tls_after_fork()` when
    running with the GIL disabled. We already properly handle the case where
    the thread state is `_Py_THREAD_ATTACHED` in `tstate_delete_common()` --
    we just need to remove an assertion.

    Keeping the thread attached means that a stop-the-world pause, such as
    for a `fork()`, won't commence until we remove our thread state from the
    interpreter's linked list. This prevents a crash when the child process
    tries to clean up the dead thread states.

    gh-117348: Refactored RawConfigParser._read for similicity and comprehensibility (#117372)

    * Extract method for _read_inner, reducing complexity and indentation by 1.

    * Extract method for _raise_all and yield ParseErrors from _read_inner.

    Reduces complexity by 1 and reduces touch points for handling errors in _read_inner.

    * Prefer iterators to splat expansion and literal indexing.

    * Extract method for _strip_comments. Reduces complexity by 7.

    * Model the file lines in a class to encapsulate the comment status and cleaned value.

    * Encapsulate the read state as a dataclass

    * Extract _handle_continuation_line and _handle_rest methods. Reduces complexity by 8.

    * Reindent

    * At least for now, collect errors in the ReadState

    * Check for missing section header separately.

    * Extract methods for _handle_header and _handle_option. Reduces complexity by 6.

    * Remove unreachable code. Reduces complexity by 4.

    * Remove unreachable branch

    * Handle error condition early. Reduces complexity by 1.

    * Add blurb

    * Move _raise_all to ParsingError, as its behavior is most closely related to the exception class and not the reader.

    * Split _strip* into separate methods.

    * Refactor _strip_full to compute the strip just once and use 'not any' to determine the factor.

    * Replace use of 'sys.maxsize' with direct computation of the stripped value.

    * Extract has_comments as a dynamic property.

    * Implement clean as a cached property.

    * Model comment prefixes in the RawConfigParser within a prefixes namespace.

    * Use a regular expression to search for the first match.

    Avoids mutating variables and tricky logic and over-computing all of the starts when only the first is relevant.

    gh-117300: Use stop the world to make `sys._current_frames` and `sys._current_exceptions` thread-safe. (#117301)

    This adds a stop the world pause to make the two functions thread-safe
    when the GIL is disabled in the free-threaded build.

    Additionally, the main test thread may call `sys._current_exceptions()` as
    soon as `g_raised.set()` is called. The background thread may not yet reach
    the `leave_g.wait()` line.

    gh-111926: Avoid locking in PyType_IsSubtype (#117275)

    Read the MRO in a thread-unsafe way in `PyType_IsSubtype` to avoid locking. Fixing this is tracked in #117306.

    The motivation for this change is in support of making weakrefs thread-safe in free-threaded builds:

    `WeakValueDictionary` uses a special dictionary function, `_PyDict_DelItemIf`
    to remove dead weakrefs from the dictionary. `_PyDict_DelItemIf` removes a key
    if a user supplied predicate evaluates to true for the value associated with
    the key. Crucially for the `WeakValueDictionary` use case, the predicate
    evaluation + deletion sequence is atomic, provided that the predicate doesn’t
    suspend. The predicate used by `WeakValueDictionary` includes a subtype check,
    which we must ensure doesn't suspend in free-threaded builds.

    with the GIL disabled.

    gh-112529: Don't untrack tuples or dicts with zero refcount (#117370)

    The free-threaded GC sometimes sees objects with zero refcount. This can
    happen due to the delay in merging biased reference counting fields,
    and, in the future, due to deferred reference counting. We should not
    untrack these objects or they will never be collected.

    This fixes the refleaks in the free-threaded build.

    gh-89739: gh-77140: Support zip64 in zipimport (GH-94146)

    * Reads zip64 files as produced by the zipfile module
    * Include tests (somewhat slow, however, because of the need to create \"large\" zips)
    * About the same amount of strictness reading invalid zip files as zipfile has
    * Still works on files with prepended data (like pex)

    There are a lot more test cases at https://github.com/thatch/zipimport64/ that give me confidence that this works for real-world files.

    Fixes #89739 and #77140.

    gh-115627: Fix PySSL_SetError handling SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL (GH-115628)

    Python 3.10 changed from using SSL_write() and SSL_read() to SSL_write_ex() and
    SSL_read_ex(), but did not update handling of the return value.

    Change error handling so that the return value is not examined.
    OSError (not EOF) is now returned when retval is 0.

    According to *recent* man pages of all functions for which we call
    PySSL_SetError, (in OpenSSL 3.0 and 1.1.1), their return value should
    be used to determine whether an error happened (i.e. if PySSL_SetError
    should be called), but not what kind of error happened (so,
    PySSL_SetError shouldn't need retval). To get the error,
    we need to use SSL_get_error.

    This fixes XML unittest fallout from the https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115398 security fix.  When configured using `--with-system-expat` on systems with older pre 2.6.0 versions of libexpat, our unittests were failing.

    * sax|etree: Fix reparse deferral tests for vanilla Expat <2.6.0

    This *does not fix* the case of distros with an older version of libexpat with the 2.6.0 feature backported as a security fix.  (Ubuntu is a known example of this with its libexpat1 2.5.0-2ubunutu0.1 package)

    GH-113171: Fix \"private\" (non-global) IP address ranges (GH-113179)

    * GH-113171: Fix \"private\" (really non-global) IP address ranges

    The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
    implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
    overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
    globally reachable by the IANA registries).

    This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
    incorrect.

    I left 100.64.0.0/10 alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1]
    and I'm not sure if we want to undo that as I don't quite understand the
    motivation behind it.

    The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
    networks for IPv6.

    GH-116939: Rewrite binarysort() (#116940)

    Rewrote binarysort() for clarity.

    Also changed the signature to be more coherent (it was mixing sortslice with raw pointers).

    No change in method or functionality. However, I left some experiments in, disabled for now
    via `#if` tricks. Since this code was first written, some kinds of comparisons have gotten
    enormously faster (like for lists of floats), which changes the tradeoffs.

    For example, plain insertion sort's simpler innermost loop and highly predictable branches
    leave it very competitive (even beating, by a bit) binary insertion when comparisons are
    very cheap, despite that it can do many more compares. And it wins big on runs that
    are already sorted (moving the next one in takes only 1 compare then).

    So I left code for a plain insertion sort, to make future experimenting easier.

    Also made the maximum value of minrun a `#define` (``MAX_MINRUN`) to make
    experimenting with that easier too.

    And another bit of `#if``-disabled code rewrites binary insertion's innermost loop to
    remove its unpredictable branch. Surprisingly, this doesn't really seem to help
    overall. I'm unclear on why not. It certainly adds more instructions, but they're very
    simple, and it's hard to be believe they cost as much as a branch miss.

    gh-105716: Fix _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() For Embedders (gh-117140)

    When I added _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() and friends last year, I tried to accommodate applications that embed Python but don't call _PyInterpreterState_SetRunningMain() (not that they're expected to).  That mostly worked fine until my recent changes in gh-117049, where the subtleties with the fallback code led to failures; the change ended up breaking test_tools.test_freeze, which exercises a basic embedding situation.

    The simplest fix is to drop the fallback code I originally added to _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() (and later to _PyThreadState_IsRunningMain()).  I've kept the fallback in the _xxsubinterpreters module though.  I've also updated Py_FrozenMain() to call _PyInterpreterState_SetRunningMain().

    gh-117045: Add code object to function version cache (#117028)

    Changes to the function version cache:

    - In addition to the function object, also store the code object,
      and allow the latter to be retrieved even if the function has been evicted.
    - Stop assigning new function versions after a critical attribute (e.g. `__code__`)
      has been modified; the version is permanently reset to zero in this case.
    - Changes to `__annotations__` are no longer considered critical. (This fixes gh-109998.)

    Changes to the Tier 2 optimization machinery:

    - If we cannot map a function version to a function, but it is still mapped to a code object,
      we continue projecting the trace.
      The operand of the `_PUSH_FRAME` and `_POP_FRAME` opcodes can be either NULL,
      a function object, or a code object with the lowest bit set.

    This allows us to trace through code that calls an ephemeral function,
    i.e., a function that may not be alive when we are constructing the executor,
    e.g. a generator expression or certain nested functions.
    We will lose globals removal inside such functions,
    but we can still do other peephole operations
    (and even possibly [call inlining](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116290),
    if we decide to do it), which only need the code object.
    As before, if we cannot retrieve the code object from the cache, we stop projecting.

    gh-116333: Relax error string text expectations in SSL-related tests (GH-116334)

    * Relax error string text expectations in SSL-related tests

    As suggested [here][1], this change relaxes the OpenSSL error string
    text expectations in a number of tests. This was specifically done in
    support of more easily building CPython [AWS-LC][2], but because AWS-LC
    is a fork of [BoringSSL][3], it should increase compatibility with that
    library as well.

    In addition to the error string relaxations, we also add some guards
    around the `tls-unique` channel binding being used with TLSv1.3, as that
    feature (described in [RFC 6929][4]) is [not defined][5] for TLSv1.3.

    Split `_PyThreadState_DeleteExcept` into two functions:

    - `_PyThreadState_RemoveExcept` removes all thread states other than one
      passed as an argument. It returns the removed thread states as a
      linked list.

    - `_PyThreadState_DeleteList` deletes those dead thread states. It may
      call destructors, so we want to \"start the world\" before calling
      `_PyThreadState_DeleteList` to avoid potential deadlocks.

    gh-116522: Stop the world before fork() and during shutdown (#116607)

    This changes the free-threaded build to perform a stop-the-world pause
    before deleting other thread states when forking and during shutdown.
    This fixes some crashes when using multiprocessing and during shutdown
    when running with `PYTHON_GIL=0`.

    This also changes `PyOS_BeforeFork` to acquire the runtime lock
    (i.e., `HEAD_LOCK(&_PyRuntime)`) before forking to ensure that data
    protected by the runtime lock (and not just the GIL or stop-the-world)
    is in a consistent state before forking.

    gh-114314: ctypes: remove stgdict and switch to heap types (GH-116458)

    Before this change, ctypes classes used a custom dict subclass, `StgDict`,
    as their `tp_dict`. This acts like a regular dict but also includes extra information
    about the type.

    This replaces stgdict by `StgInfo`, a C struct on the type, accessed by
    `PyObject_GetTypeData()` (PEP-697).
    All usage of `StgDict` (mainly variables named `stgdict`, `dict`, `edict` etc.) is
    converted to `StgInfo` (named `stginfo`, `info`, `einfo`, etc.).
    Where the dict is actually used for class attributes (as a regular PyDict), it's now
    called `attrdict`.

    This change -- not overriding `tp_dict` -- is made to make me comfortable with
    the next part of this PR: moving the initialization logic from `tp_new` to `tp_init`.

    The `StgInfo` is set up in `__init__` of each class, with a guard that prevents
    calling `__init__` more than once. Note that abstract classes (like `Array` or
    `Structure`) are created using `PyType_FromMetaclass` and do not have
    `__init__` called.
    Previously, this was done in `__new__`, which also wasn't called for abstract
    classes.
    Since `__init__` can be called from Python code or skipped, there is a tested
    guard to ensure `StgInfo` is initialized exactly once before it's used.

    gh-117303: Don't detach in `PyThreadState_DeleteCurrent()` (#117304)

    This fixes a crash in `test_threading.test_reinit_tls_after_fork()` when
    running with the GIL disabled. We already properly handle the case where
    the thread state is `_Py_THREAD_ATTACHED` in `tstate_delete_common()` --
    we just need to remove an assertion.

    Keeping the thread attached means that a stop-the-world pause, such as
    for a `fork()`, won't commence until we remove our thread state from the
    interpreter's linked list. This prevents a crash when the child process
    tries to clean up the dead thread states.

    gh-117348: Refactored RawConfigParser._read for similicity and comprehensibility (#117372)

    * Extract method for _read_inner, reducing complexity and indentation by 1.

    * Extract method for _raise_all and yield ParseErrors from _read_inner.

    Reduces complexity by 1 and reduces touch points for handling errors in _read_inner.

    * Prefer iterators to splat expansion and literal indexing.

    * Extract method for _strip_comments. Reduces complexity by 7.

    * Model the file lines in a class to encapsulate the comment status and cleaned value.

    * Encapsulate the read state as a dataclass

    * Extract _handle_continuation_line and _handle_rest methods. Reduces complexity by 8.

    * Reindent

    * At least for now, collect errors in the ReadState

    * Check for missing section header separately.

    * Extract methods for _handle_header and _handle_option. Reduces complexity by 6.

    * Remove unreachable code. Reduces complexity by 4.

    * Remove unreachable branch

    * Handle error condition early. Reduces complexity by 1.

    * Add blurb

    * Move _raise_all to ParsingError, as its behavior is most closely related to the exception class and not the reader.

    * Split _strip* into separate methods.

    * Refactor _strip_full to compute the strip just once and use 'not any' to determine the factor.

    * Replace use of 'sys.maxsize' with direct computation of the stripped value.

    * Extract has_comments as a dynamic property.

    * Implement clean as a cached property.

    * Model comment prefixes in the RawConfigParser within a prefixes namespace.

    * Use a regular expression to search for the first match.

    Avoids mutating variables and tricky logic and over-computing all of the starts when only the first is relevant.

    gh-117300: Use stop the world to make `sys._current_frames` and `sys._current_exceptions` thread-safe. (#117301)

    This adds a stop the world pause to make the two functions thread-safe
    when the GIL is disabled in the free-threaded build.

    Additionally, the main test thread may call `sys._current_exceptions()` as
    soon as `g_raised.set()` is called. The background thread may not yet reach
    the `leave_g.wait()` line.

    gh-111926: Avoid locking in PyType_IsSubtype (#117275)

    Read the MRO in a thread-unsafe way in `PyType_IsSubtype` to avoid locking. Fixing this is tracked in #117306.

    The motivation for this change is in support of making weakrefs thread-safe in free-threaded builds:

    `WeakValueDictionary` uses a special dictionary function, `_PyDict_DelItemIf`
    to remove dead weakrefs from the dictionary. `_PyDict_DelItemIf` removes a key
    if a user supplied predicate evaluates to true for the value associated with
    the key. Crucially for the `WeakValueDictionary` use case, the predicate
    evaluation + deletion sequence is atomic, provided that the predicate doesn’t
    suspend. The predicate used by `WeakValueDictionary` includes a subtype check,
    which we must ensure doesn't suspend in free-threaded builds.

    with the GIL disabled.

    gh-112529: Don't untrack tuples or dicts with zero refcount (#117370)

    The free-threaded GC sometimes sees objects with zero refcount. This can
    happen due to the delay in merging biased reference counting fields,
    and, in the future, due to deferred reference counting. We should not
    untrack these objects or they will never be collected.

    This fixes the refleaks in the free-threaded build.

    * Reads zip64 files as produced by the zipfile module

    * About the same amount of strictness reading invalid zip files as zipfile has
    * Still works on files with prepended data (like pex)

    There are a lot more test cases at https://github.com/thatch/zipimport64/ that give me confidence that this works for real-world files.

    Fixes #89739 and #77140.

    gh-115627: Fix PySSL_SetError handling SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL (GH-115628)

    Python 3.10 changed from using SSL_write() and SSL_read() to SSL_write_ex() and
    SSL_read_ex(), but did not update handling of the return value.

    Change error handling so that the return value is not examined.
    OSError (not EOF) is now returned when retval is 0.

    According to *recent* man pages of all functions for which we call
    PySSL_SetError, (in OpenSSL 3.0 and 1.1.1), their return value should
    be used to determine whether an error happened (i.e. if PySSL_SetError
    should be called), but not what kind of error happened (so,
    PySSL_SetError shouldn't need retval). To get the error,
    we need to use SSL_get_error.

    GH-113171: Fix "private" (non-global) IP address ranges (GH-113179)

    * GH-113171: Fix "private" (really non-global) IP address ranges

    The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
    implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
    overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
    globally reachable by the IANA registries).

    This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
    incorrect.

    I left 100.64.0.0/10 alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1]
    and I'm not sure if we want to undo that as I don't quite understand the
    motivation behind it.

    GH-116939: Rewrite binarysort() (#116940)

    Rewrote binarysort() for clarity.

    Also changed the signature to be more coherent (it was mixing sortslice with raw pointers).

    No change in method or functionality. However, I left some experiments in, disabled for now
    via `#if` tricks. Since this code was first written, some kinds of comparisons have gotten
    enormously faster (like for lists of floats), which changes the tradeoffs.

    For example, plain insertion sort's simpler innermost loop and highly predictable branches
    leave it very competitive (even beating, by a bit) binary insertion when comparisons are
    very cheap, despite that it can do many more compares. And it wins big on runs that
    are already sorted (moving the next one in takes only 1 compare then).

    So I left code for a plain insertion sort, to make future experimenting easier.

    Also made the maximum value of minrun a `#define` (``MAX_MINRUN`) to make
    experimenting with that easier too.

    And another bit of `#if``-disabled code rewrites binary insertion's innermost loop to
    remove its unpredictable branch. Surprisingly, this doesn't really seem to help
    overall. I'm unclear on why not. It certainly adds more instructions, but they're very
    simple, and it's hard to be believe they cost as much as a branch miss.

    gh-105716: Fix _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() For Embedders (gh-117140)

    When I added _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() and friends last year, I tried to accommodate applications that embed Python but don't call _PyInterpreterState_SetRunningMain() (not that they're expected to).  That mostly worked fine until my recent changes in gh-117049, where the subtleties with the fallback code led to failures; the change ended up breaking test_tools.test_freeze, which exercises a basic embedding situation.

    The simplest fix is to drop the fallback code I originally added to _PyInterpreterState_IsRunningMain() (and later to _PyThreadState_IsRunningMain()).  I've kept the fallback in the _xxsubinterpreters module though.  I've also updated Py_FrozenMain() to call _PyInterpreterState_SetRunningMain().

    gh-117045: Add code object to function version cache (#117028)

    Changes to the function version cache:

    - In addition to the function object, also store the code object,
      and allow the latter to be retrieved even if the function has been evicted.
    - Stop assigning new function versions after a critical attribute (e.g. `__code__`)
      has been modified; the version is permanently reset to zero in this case.
    - Changes to `__annotations__` are no longer considered critical. (This fixes gh-109998.)

    Changes to the Tier 2 optimization machinery:

    - If we cannot map a function version to a function, but it is still mapped to a code object,
      we continue projecting the trace.
      The operand of the `_PUSH_FRAME` and `_POP_FRAME` opcodes can be either NULL,
      a function object, or a code object with the lowest bit set.

    This allows us to trace through code that calls an ephemeral function,
    i.e., a function that may not be alive when we are constructing the executor,
    e.g. a generator expression or certain nested functions.
    We will lose globals removal inside such functions,
    but we can still do other peephole operations
    (and even possibly [call inlining](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116290),
    if we decide to do it), which only need the code object.
    As before, if we cannot retrieve the code object from the cache, we stop projecting.

    gh-116333: Relax error string text expectations in SSL-related tests (GH-116334)

    * Relax error string text expectations in SSL-related tests

    As suggested [here][1], this change relaxes the OpenSSL error string
    text expectations in a number of tests. This was specifically done in
    support of more easily building CPython [AWS-LC][2], but because AWS-LC
    is a fork of [BoringSSL][3], it should increase compatibility with that
    library as well.

    In addition to the error string relaxations, we also add some guards
    around the `tls-unique` channel binding being used with TLSv1.3, as that
    feature (described in [RFC 6929][4]) is [not defined][5] for TLSv1.3.

    gh-116522: Refactor `_PyThreadState_DeleteExcept` (#117131)

    Split `_PyThreadState_DeleteExcept` into two functions:

    - `_PyThreadState_RemoveExcept` removes all thread states other than one
      passed as an argument. It returns the removed thread states as a
      linked list.

    - `_PyThreadState_DeleteList` deletes those dead thread states. It may
      call destructors, so we want to "start the world" before calling
      `_PyThreadState_DeleteList` to avoid potential deadlocks.

    gh-116522: Stop the world before fork() and during shutdown (#116607)

    This changes the free-threaded build to perform a stop-the-world pause
    before deleting other thread states when forking and during shutdown.
    This fixes some crashes when using multiprocessing and during shutdown
    when running with `PYTHON_GIL=0`.

    This also changes `PyOS_BeforeFork` to acquire the runtime lock
    (i.e., `HEAD_LOCK(&_PyRuntime)`) before forking to ensure that data
    protected by the runtime lock (and not just the GIL or stop-the-world)
    is in a consistent state before forking.

    gh-114314: ctypes: remove stgdict and switch to heap types (GH-116458)

    Before this change, ctypes classes used a custom dict subclass, `StgDict`,
    as their `tp_dict`. This acts like a regular dict but also includes extra information
    about the type.

    This replaces stgdict by `StgInfo`, a C struct on the type, accessed by
    `PyObject_GetTypeData()` (PEP-697).
    All usage of `StgDict` (mainly variables named `stgdict`, `dict`, `edict` etc.) is
    converted to `StgInfo` (named `stginfo`, `info`, `einfo`, etc.).
    Where the dict is actually used for class attributes (as a regular PyDict), it's now
    called `attrdict`.

    This change -- not overriding `tp_dict` -- is made to make me comfortable with
    the next part of this PR: moving the initialization logic from `tp_new` to `tp_init`.

    The `StgInfo` is set up in `__init__` of each class, with a guard that prevents
    calling `__init__` more than once. Note that abstract classes (like `Array` or
    `Structure`) are created using `PyType_FromMetaclass` and do not have
    `__init__` called.
    Previously, this was done in `__new__`, which also wasn't called for abstract
    classes.
    Since `__init__` can be called from Python code or skipped, there is a tested
    guard to ensure `StgInfo` is initialized exactly once before it's used.

The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
globally reachable by the IANA registries).

This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
incorrect.

I left 100.64.0.0/10 alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1]
and I'm not sure if we want to undo that as I don't quite understand the
motivation behind it.

The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
networks for IPv6.

| [@encukou](https://github.com/encukou) Sure! "is\_private" value should correspond with negation of the "Globally Reachable" value in IP special purpose address registries for [IPv4](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml) and [IPv6](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml). From the IPv4 table `0.0.0.0/8` is marked as not globally reachable so `is_private` should be `True`. |

| The 3.10-/3.11+ beahviour difference is about *networks*. The test checks `0.0.0.0/0`: the network containing all IPv4 addresses. Some are private, some not, but `is_private` is just a boolean. |

In 3.10 and below, is_private checks whether the network and broadcast
address are both private.
In later versions (where the test wss backported from), it checks
whether they both are in the same private network.

For 0.0.0.0/0, both 0.0.0.0 and 255.225.255.255 are private,
but one is in 0.0.0.0/8 (\"This network\") and the other in

* GH-113171: Fix \"private\" (non-global) IP address ranges (GH-113179)

The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
globally reachable by the IANA registries).

This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
incorrect.

100.64.0.0/10 is left alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1].

The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
networks for IPv6.

* GH-65056: Improve the IP address' is_global/is_private documentation (GH-113186)

It wasn't clear what the semantics of is_global/is_private are and, when
one gets to the bottom of it, it's not quite so simple (hence the
exceptions listed).

The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
globally reachable by the IANA registries).

This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
incorrect.

100.64.0.0/10 is left alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1].

The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
networks for IPv6.

255.255.255.255/32 ("Limited broadcast").

The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
globally reachable by the IANA registries).

This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
incorrect.

100.64.0.0/10 is left alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1].

The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
networks for IPv6.

In 3.10 and below, is_private checks whether the network and broadcast
address are both private.
In later versions (where the test wss backported from), it checks
whether they both are in the same private network.
