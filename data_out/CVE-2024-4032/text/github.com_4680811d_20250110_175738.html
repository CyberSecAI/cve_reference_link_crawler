* [GH-113171](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113171): Fix "private" (non-global) IP address ranges ([GH-113179](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113179))

The _private_networks variables, used by various is_private
implementations, were missing some ranges and at the same time had
overly strict ranges (where there are more specific ranges considered
globally reachable by the IANA registries).

This patch updates the ranges with what was missing or otherwise
incorrect.

100.64.0.0/10 is left alone, for now, as it's been made special in [1].

The _address_exclude_many() call returns 8 networks for IPv4, 121
networks for IPv6.

[1] [#61602](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/61602)

* [GH-65056](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/65056): Improve the IP address' is_global/is_private documentation ([GH-113186](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113186))

It wasn't clear what the semantics of is_global/is_private are and, when
one gets to the bottom of it, it's not quite so simple (hence the
exceptions listed).
