|  | This describes an issue in `http-proxy-middleware` where the Node.js process dies due to `UnhandledPromiseRejection` when a user makes requests to certain paths. Here are steps to reproduce: |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | 1. Run a server like this: |
|  | ```js |
|  | const express = require('express') |
|  | const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware') |
|  |  |
|  | const frontend = express() |
|  | frontend.use(createProxyMiddleware({ |
|  | target: 'http://localhost:3031', |
|  | pathFilter: '\*' |
|  | })) |
|  | frontend.listen(3030) |
|  |  |
|  | const backend = express() |
|  | backend.use((req, res) => res.send('ok')) |
|  | backend.listen(3031) |
|  | ``` |
|  |  |
|  | 2. `curl 'localhost:3030//x@x'` |
|  |  |
|  | Expected: Response with payload `ok` |
|  | Actual: Server crashes with error `TypeError: Expected input to be a string` (from `micromatch`) |
|  |  |
|  | On v1 and v2 of `http-proxy-middleware`, it's also possible to exclude `pathFilter` and cause the server to crash with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'indexOf')` (from `matchSingleStringPath`). |
|  |  |
|  | This has been patched in v2.0.7 and v3.0.3 of `http-proxy-middleware`. |
