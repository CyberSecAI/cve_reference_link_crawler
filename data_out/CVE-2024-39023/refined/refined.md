Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the potential CVE:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The `idccms V1.35` application is vulnerable to CSRF. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates that an attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when opened by a logged-in user of the vulnerable application, can trigger unauthorized actions on the server by submitting a form with attacker-controlled values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms in the `idccms` application. Specifically, it appears that the `/admin/info_deal.php` endpoint does not implement any anti-CSRF token checks. The form in the provided HTML PoC can be submitted by any user visiting the HTML page, without the server validating that the request originated from a legitimate user session.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in victim. The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to create news articles, which could lead to various malicious activities, including content manipulation, defacement, and potentially more severe impacts depending on the specific functions of the application. 

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a crafted HTML page that is hosted by the attacker.
- The victim must be a logged-in user of the vulnerable idccms application.
- The victim needs to be tricked into visiting the attacker-controlled page. This is typically done via techniques such as phishing or other forms of social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious HTML page.
- The attacker doesn't need any special access to the idccms application, besides an understanding of its functionality and endpoints.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated within the idccms application. The attack relies on the user being logged-in.
- Knowledge of the target application's form structure and parameters is needed to create the CSRF exploit HTML page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The PoC shows an example of adding news content but the same vulnerability can likely be used to modify other data, depending on the application.
- The PoC includes a large number of hidden form fields, indicating a complex data structure for the application.
