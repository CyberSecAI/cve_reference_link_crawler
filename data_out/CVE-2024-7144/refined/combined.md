### Description

The JetElements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'id' and 'slide\_id' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.20 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
