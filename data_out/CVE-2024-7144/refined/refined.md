**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Website Compromise:** The injected scripts could potentially perform various malicious actions, including redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing session cookies, modifying page content, and performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Loss of Integrity & Confidentiality:** This vulnerability can lead to data manipulation, unauthorized access and potentially loss of control over the affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious script through the plugin's interface via the 'id' and 'slide\_id' parameters

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a WordPress user with at least Contributor-level access.
*   **Plugin Interaction:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable parameters of the JetElements plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the JetElements plugin up to and including version 2.6.20.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by stealthcopter
*   The vendor has released a patch in version 2.6.20.1.
