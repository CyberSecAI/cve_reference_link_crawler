The provided content is related to CVE-2023-41965.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the insecure storage of sensitive information within the web application of the affected device. Specifically, the authentication process lacks sufficient security measures, allowing sensitive information to be obtained.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922). The lack of security in the authentication process allows information to be obtained by sending requests to the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and has low complexity. An attacker can send requests to the web application of the vulnerable device to obtain sensitive information due to the lack of security in the authentication process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs remote network access to the vulnerable device. No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
