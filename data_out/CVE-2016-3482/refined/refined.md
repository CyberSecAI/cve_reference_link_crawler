  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the SSL/TLS module of the Oracle HTTP Server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "A security flaw in the handling of SSL/TLS communication.",
       "Improper handling of requests over HTTPS."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system. While the risk matrix indicates a potential impact on confidentiality without any impact on integrity or availability, it's possible that in some configurations or due to chaining with other exploits, a greater impact could occur.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "Remote exploitation via HTTPS."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required for the exploit."
