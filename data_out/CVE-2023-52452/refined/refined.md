  "CVE-2023-52452": {
    "description": "Privileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack memory but, before this patch, these accesses were permitted inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted above state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the stack was already 'large enough', the access was permitted, but otherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to 'grow the stack'. This undesired rejection was happening in two places: - in check_stack_slot_within_bounds() - in check_stack_range_initialized(). This patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. This patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset reads. Before this patch, writes to the stack using registers containing a variable offset were not properly contributing to the function's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program to verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime because a too small stack had been allocated for it.",
    "root_cause": "Inconsistent handling of uninitialized stack memory accesses and incorrect stack size tracking for variable-offset reads.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inconsistent permission of uninitialized stack memory accesses",
      "Incorrect calculation of stack size for variable-offset reads leading to potential out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "impact": "Privileged BPF programs could read uninitialized stack memory inconsistently. Additionally, incorrect stack size calculation could lead to out-of-bounds memory access at runtime.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious BPF program could exploit the inconsistent handling of uninitialized stack reads to potentially leak sensitive information or cause a crash. Also, incorrect stack size calculations could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, causing unpredictable behavior or crashes.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to load and execute a privileged BPF program."
