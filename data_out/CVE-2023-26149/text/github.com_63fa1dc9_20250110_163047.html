| Should we start a new `CHANGELOG.md` file in the root of the repository? Otherwise, I can add an upgrade notes section to the changelog if you'd like!  I like the README approach. It also means that people that visit **npm** page would see the important upgrade instructions. |

Looks good to me.

In summary:

* Existing Delta documents will loose their rendered HTML in `value`, but that is expected, as it may be currently polluted with XSS.
* New Delta documents will only ever store String (plain text) in `value` - the documentation reflects it.
* HTML rendering is still supported through the use of custom blots, that extend the default `MentionBlot`. They must implement a `render` method that returns an `Element`. Functionality of rendering HTML is maintained.
* Furthermore, the use of custom blot name means that `mention` objects with custom `data` payload will be explicitly handled by the custom blot, rather than the default one.
* I could not find any new XSS vectors (except for the end user introducing one in their `render` method).

Good work!
