- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw was found in the protection for device tampering (Secure Boot) in AXIS OS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Secure Boot mechanism was vulnerable to a sophisticated attack, allowing it to be bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Bypassing the Secure Boot protection would likely allow for the execution of unauthorized code or the modification of the device's firmware.
- **Attack vectors**: The content indicates a "sophisticated attack" is needed but does not specify the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The content indicates a "sophisticated attack" is needed but does not specify the attacker capabilities or position.
