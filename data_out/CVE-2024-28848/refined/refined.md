Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-28848

**Root Cause:**
- The `CompiledRule::validateExpression` method in `CompiledRule.java` evaluates a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression using a `StandardEvaluationContext`. This context allows the expression to interact with Java classes, including `java.lang.Runtime`, leading to remote code execution (RCE).
- The `/api/v1/policies/validation/condition/<expression>` endpoint passes user-controlled data to `CompiledRule::validateExpression` without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SpEL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to SpEL injection because it uses user-controlled input to construct and evaluate SpEL expressions without proper sanitization or a restricted evaluation context.
- **Missing Authorization:** The endpoint `/api/v1/policies/validation/condition/<expression>` lacks authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user (not just admins) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious SpEL expressions, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the OpenMetadata instance.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the affected system, allowing the attacker to potentially steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via the API endpoint.
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/api/v1/policies/validation/condition/<expression>`, with the malicious SpEL expression URL-encoded in the `<expression>` part of the path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered and authenticated user on the OpenMetadata platform. This vulnerability is not exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the OpenMetadata server.
- **Knowledge of SpEL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SpEL syntax and the ability to craft malicious expressions.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `CompiledRule.java` file, specifically in the `validateExpression` method.
- The `PolicyResource.java` shows the vulnerable API endpoint `/api/v1/policies/validation/condition/{expression}` which takes user-provided data as a path parameter `expression`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the user-supplied `expression` is passed to `CompiledRule::validateExpression` which uses `StandardEvaluationContext` to evaluate the expression, instead of the more secure `SimpleEvaluationContext`.
- The vulnerability is triggered due to a missing authorization check that does not call `Authorizer.authorize()`
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to construct a SpEL expression to execute the `touch /tmp/pwned` command, confirming RCE.

**Remediation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by using a `SimpleEvaluationContext` in `CompiledRule.validateExpression`, which prevents access to Java types, constructors, and bean references.
- The fix is available in version 1.2.4 of OpenMetadata.
