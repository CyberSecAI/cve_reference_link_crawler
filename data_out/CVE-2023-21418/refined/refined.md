- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VAPIX API `irissetup.cgi` is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability in the `irissetup.cgi` API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows for file deletion on the system. The impact is lower with operator service accounts, being limited to non-system files, and higher with administrator-privileged accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the vulnerable `irissetup.cgi` API through path traversal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires authentication with an operator- or administrator-privileged service account.
