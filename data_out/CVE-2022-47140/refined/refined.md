- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ARMember WordPress plugin (versions <= 4.0.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts would be executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to various attacks including stealing session cookies, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the website via user supplied inputs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
