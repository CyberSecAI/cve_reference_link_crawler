SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities affecting various third-party components of SINEC INS before V1.0 SP2 could
allow an attacker to cause a denial of service condition, disclose sensitive data or violate the system
integrity.

Siemens has released an update for the SINEC INS and recommends to update to the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-speciÔ¨Åc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conÔ¨Ågure the environment according to Siemens‚Äô operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC INS (Infrastructure Network Services) is a web-based application that combines various network
services in one tool. This simpliÔ¨Åes installation and administration of all network services relevant for
industrial networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiÔ¨Åcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.Ô¨Årst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciÔ¨Åc to the customer‚Äôs
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deÔ¨Åned by the customer to accomplish Ô¨Ånal scoring.

An additional classiÔ¨Åcation has been performed using the CWE classiÔ¨Åcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiÔ¨Åcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-4160

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms
are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because
the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis
suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difÔ¨Åcult to perform
and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difÔ¨Åcult)
because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed
ofÔ¨Çine. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be signiÔ¨Åcant. However, for an
attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple
clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions
1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December
2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium
support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects
OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m
(Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).

Vulnerability CVE-2021-23839

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is conÔ¨Ågured
to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version
rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater
than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than
SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding
is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server
support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation
of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding
is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if
a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a
normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x
are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have conÔ¨Ågured SSLv2
support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have conÔ¨Ågured SSLv2 support at runtime (this
is off by default), 3) have conÔ¨Ågured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite
list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue.
The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This
also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although
1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the
RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding
mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this
is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no
longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to
1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).

CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength

Vulnerability CVE-2021-23841

The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash
value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certiÔ¨Åcate. However it
fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer Ô¨Åeld (which might occur if
the issuer Ô¨Åeld is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and
a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is
never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function
directly and they use it on certiÔ¨Åcates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to

CVE ID         : CVE-2022-0235

ranjit-git discovered an information leak vulnerability in node-fetch, a
