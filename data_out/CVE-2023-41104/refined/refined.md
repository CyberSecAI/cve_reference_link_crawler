Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `vmod-digest` library's implementation of base64 decoding. Specifically, the functions `digest.base64_decode`, `digest.base64url_decode`, and `digest.base64url_nopad_decode` are affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of base64 decoding within the `vmod-digest` library. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing specially crafted base64 encoded strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication bypass:** If `vmod-digest` is used for basic HTTP authentication, an attacker could potentially bypass authentication checks by providing specially crafted base64 encoded credentials.
- **Information disclosure:** If the decoded string is made visible to the attacker (e.g., added to a response header), it could lead to the disclosure of out-of-band workspace data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending malicious base64 encoded data as part of a request to an application that uses `vmod-digest` for base64 decoding. This could be in the form of HTTP headers, parameters, or other input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a system using the vulnerable `vmod-digest` library.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft base64 encoded payloads that will exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in `vmod-digest` versions prior to 2023-08-17
- The vulnerability affects the `vmod-digest` library, which is a 3rd party VMOD maintained by Varnish Software, but not part of the core Varnish Cache Project.
- Mitigation is possible by either updating the `vmod-digest` library or using a workaround by switching to `vmod-blob` for base64 decoding.
- The vulnerability was discovered by an external party and not reported responsibly to the vendor.
