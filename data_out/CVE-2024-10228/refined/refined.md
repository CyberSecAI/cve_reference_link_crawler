- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Vagrant VMware Utility Windows installer used a custom installation location with a non-protected path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The use of a non-protected path allowed an unprivileged user to modify files within the installation directory. This vulnerability was specific to the Windows platform.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized file system writes could lead to system-dependent impacts, potentially including privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could modify the files in the non-protected installation path by leveraging their unprivileged access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have an unprivileged user account on the Windows system where the vulnerable software is installed.
