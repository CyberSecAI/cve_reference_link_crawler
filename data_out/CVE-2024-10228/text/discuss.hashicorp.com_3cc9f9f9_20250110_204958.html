**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2024-25

**Affected Products / Versions:** Vagrant VMware Utility <= 1.0.22, fixed in 1.0.23

**Publication Date:** October 29, 2024

**Summary**

The Vagrant VMware Utility Windows installer targeted a custom location with a non-protected path that could be modified by an unprivileged user, introducing potential for unauthorized file system writes. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-10228, was fixed in Vagrant VMware Utility 1.0.23

**Background**

Vagrant VMware Utility is a tool distributed separately from Vagrant that enables Vagrant to be used with VMware software. For more information, please read our documentation about [Vagrant VMware Providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/vmware).

For the Windows platform, the format used is [Windows Installer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-portal) (MSI).

**Details**

It was reported that the Vagrant VMware Utility’s Windows installer’s usage of a custom location with a non-protected path exposed the target system to unauthorized file system write. The impact of this is system-dependent, but in some cases may include privilege escalation. This issue did not impact non-Windows platforms. This vulnerability was fixed in Vagrant VMware Utility 1.0.23.

**Remediation**

This was addressed in Vagrant VMware Utility 1.0.23 by moving the Windows install location to the system-protected Program Files directory.

Users should evaluate the risk and consider upgrading to Vagrant VMWare Utility 1.0.23. Please refer to our [plugin installation instructions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/vmware/installation) for information on upgrading. Please refer to [Upgrading Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/installation/upgrading) for general guidance and upgrade notes.
