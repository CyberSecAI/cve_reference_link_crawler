| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2221707#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-07-10 15:47:39 UTC  ``` From the upstream fix below: When the siano device is plugged in, it may call the following functions to initialize the device.  smsusb_probe()-->smsusb_init_device()-->smscore_start_device().  When smscore_start_device() gets failed, the function smsusb_term_device() will be called and smsusb_device_t will be deallocated. Although we use usb_kill_urb() in smsusb_stop_streaming() to cancel transfer requests and wait for them to finish, the worker threads that are scheduled by smsusb_onresponse() may be still running. As a result, the UAF bugs could happen.
