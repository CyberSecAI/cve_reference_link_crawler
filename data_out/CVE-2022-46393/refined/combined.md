## Description

This release of Mbed TLS provides new features, bug fixes and minor enhancements. This release includes fixes for security issues.

## Security Advisories

There are no security advisories for this release.

## Release Notes

Default behavior changes

* Previously the macro MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID implemented version 05

  of the IETF draft, and was marked experimental and disabled by default.

  It is now no longer experimental, and implements the final version from

  RFC 9146, which is not interoperable with the draft-05 version.

  If you need to communicate with peers that use earlier versions of

  Mbed TLS, then you need to define MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID\_COMPAT

  to 1, but then you won't be able to communicate with peers that use the

  standard (non-draft) version.

  If you need to interoperate with both classes of peers with the

  same build of Mbed TLS, please let us know about your situation on the

  mailing list or GitHub.

Requirement changes

* When building with PSA drivers using generate\_driver\_wrappers.py, or

  when building the library from the development branch rather than

  from a release, the Python module jsonschema is now necessary, in

  addition to jinja2. The official list of required Python modules is

  maintained in scripts/basic.requirements.txt and may change again

  in the future.

New deprecations

* Deprecate mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data().

  Use mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data\_list()

  or mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data\_list\_shallow().

Features

* Support rsa\_pss\_rsae\_\* signature algorithms in TLS 1.2.
* make: enable building unversioned shared library, with e.g.:

  "SHARED=1 SOEXT\_TLS=so SOEXT\_X509=so SOEXT\_CRYPTO=so make lib"

  resulting in library names like "libmbedtls.so" rather than

  "libmbedcrypto.so.11".
* Expose the EC J-PAKE functionality through the Draft PSA PAKE Crypto API.

  Only the ECC primitive with secp256r1 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm

  are supported in this implementation.
* Some modules can now use PSA drivers for hashes, including with no

  built-in implementation present, but only in some configurations.
  + RSA OAEP and PSS (PKCS#1 v2.1), PKCS5, PKCS12 and EC J-PAKE now use

    hashes from PSA when (and only when) MBEDTLS\_MD\_C is disabled.
  + PEM parsing of encrypted files now uses MD-5 from PSA when (and only

    when) MBEDTLS\_MD5\_C is disabled.

    See the documentation of the corresponding macros in mbedtls\_config.h for

    details.

    Note that some modules are not able to use hashes from PSA yet, including

    the entropy module. As a consequence, for now the only way to build with

    all hashes only provided by drivers (no built-in hash) is to use

    MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_EXTERNAL\_RNG.
* When MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO is enabled, X.509, TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 now

  properly negotiate/accept hashes based on their availability in PSA.

  As a consequence, they now work in configurations where the built-in

  implementations of (some) hashes are excluded and those hashes are only

  provided by PSA drivers. (See previous entry for limitation on RSA-PSS

  though: that module only use hashes from PSA when MBEDTLS\_MD\_C is off).
* Add support for opaque keys as the private keys associated to certificates

  for authentication in TLS 1.3.
* Add the LMS post-quantum-safe stateful-hash asymmetric signature scheme.

  Signature verification is production-ready, but generation is for testing

  purposes only. This currently only supports one parameter set

  (LMS\_SHA256\_M32\_H10), meaning that each private key can be used to sign

  1024 messages. As such, it is not intended for use in TLS, but instead

  for verification of assets transmitted over an insecure channel,

  particularly firmware images.
* Add the LM-OTS post-quantum-safe one-time signature scheme, which is

  required for LMS. This can be used independently, but each key can only

  be used to sign one message so is impractical for most circumstances.
* Mbed TLS now supports TLS 1.3 key establishment via pre-shared keys.

  The pre-shared keys can be provisioned externally or via the ticket

  mechanism (session resumption).

  The ticket mechanism is supported when the configuration option

  MBEDTLS\_SSL\_SESSION\_TICKETS is enabled.

  New options MBEDTLS\_SSL\_TLS1\_3\_KEY\_EXCHANGE\_MODE\_xxx\_ENABLED

  control the support for the three possible TLS 1.3 key exchange modes.
* cert\_write: support for setting extended key usage attributes. A

  corresponding new public API call has been added in the library,

  mbedtls\_x509write\_crt\_set\_ext\_key\_usage().
* cert\_write: support for writing certificate files in either PEM

  or DER format.
* The PSA driver wrapper generator generate\_driver\_wrappers.py now

  supports a subset of the driver description language, including

  the following entry points: import\_key, export\_key, export\_public\_key,

  get\_builtin\_key, copy\_key.
* The new functions mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data\_list() and

  mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data\_list\_shallow() simplify the management

  of memory in named data lists in X.509 structures.
* The TLS 1.2 EC J-PAKE key exchange can now use the PSA Crypto API.

  Additional PSA key slots will be allocated in the process of such key

  exchange for builds that enable MBEDTLS\_KEY\_EXCHANGE\_ECJPAKE\_ENABLED and

  MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO.
* Add support for DTLS Connection ID as defined by RFC 9146, controlled by

  MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID (enabled by default) and configured with

  mbedtls\_ssl\_set\_cid().
* Add a driver dispatch layer for raw key agreement, enabling alternative

  implementations of raw key agreement through the key\_agreement driver

  entry point. This entry point is specified in the proposed PSA driver

  interface, but had not yet been implemented.
* Add an ad-hoc key derivation function handling EC J-PAKE to PMS

  calculation that can be used to derive the session secret in TLS 1.2,

  as described in draft-cragie-tls-ecjpake-01. This can be achieved by

  using PSA\_ALG\_TLS12\_ECJPAKE\_TO\_PMS as the key derivation algorithm.

Security

* Fix potential heap buffer overread and overwrite in DTLS if

  MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID is enabled and

  MBEDTLS\_SSL\_CID\_IN\_LEN\_MAX > 2 \* MBEDTLS\_SSL\_CID\_OUT\_LEN\_MAX.
* An adversary with access to precise enough information about memory

  accesses (typically, an untrusted operating system attacking a secure

  enclave) could recover an RSA private key after observing the victim

  performing a single private-key operation if the window size used for the

  exponentiation was 3 or smaller. Found and reported by Zili KOU,

  Wenjian HE, Sharad Sinha, and Wei ZHANG. See "Cache Side-channel Attacks

  and Defenses of the Sliding Window Algorithm in TEEs" - Design, Automation

  and Test in Europe 2023.

Bugfix

* Refactor mbedtls\_aes\_context to support shallow-copying. Fixes [#2147](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2147).
* Fix an issue with in-tree CMake builds in releases with GEN\_FILES

  turned off: if a shipped file was missing from the working directory,

  it could be turned into a symbolic link to itself.
* Fix a long-standing build failure when building x86 PIC code with old

  gcc (4.x). The code will be slower, but will compile. We do however

  recommend upgrading to a more recent compiler instead. Fixes [#1910](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/1910).
* Fix support for little-endian Microblaze when MBEDTLS\_HAVE\_ASM is defined.

  Contributed by Kazuyuki Kimura to fix [#2020](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2020).
* Use double quotes to include private header file psa\_crypto\_cipher.h.

  Fixes 'file not found with include' error

  when building with Xcode.
* Fix handling of broken symlinks when loading certificates using

  mbedtls\_x509\_crt\_parse\_path(). Instead of returning an error as soon as a

  broken link is encountered, skip the broken link and continue parsing

  other certificate files. Contributed by Eduardo Silva in [#2602](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/2602).
* Fix an interoperability failure between an Mbed TLS client with both

  TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 support, and a TLS 1.2 server that supports

  rsa\_pss\_rsae\_\* signature algorithms. This failed because Mbed TLS

  advertised support for PSS in both TLS 1.2 and 1.3, but only

  actually supported PSS in TLS 1.3.
* Fix a compilation error when using CMake with an IAR toolchain.

  Fixes [#5964](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/5964).
* Fix a build error due to a missing prototype warning when

  MBEDTLS\_DEPRECATED\_REMOVED is enabled.
* Fix mbedtls\_ctr\_drbg\_free() on an initialized but unseeded context. When

  MBEDTLS\_AES\_ALT is enabled, it could call mbedtls\_aes\_free() on an

  uninitialized context.
* Fix a build issue on Windows using CMake where the source and build

  directories could not be on different drives. Fixes [#5751](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/5751).
* Fix bugs and missing dependencies when building and testing

  configurations with only one encryption type enabled in TLS 1.2.
* Provide the missing definition of mbedtls\_setbuf() in some configurations

  with MBEDTLS\_PLATFORM\_C disabled. Fixes [#6118](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6118), [#6196](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6196).
* Fix compilation errors when trying to build with

  PSA drivers for AEAD (GCM, CCM, Chacha20-Poly1305).
* Fix memory leak in ssl\_parse\_certificate\_request() caused by

  mbedtls\_x509\_get\_name() not freeing allocated objects in case of error.

  Change mbedtls\_x509\_get\_name() to clean up allocated objects on error.
* Fix build failure with MBEDTLS\_RSA\_C and MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C but not

  MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO or MBEDTLS\_PK\_WRITE\_C. Fixes [#6408](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6408).
* Fix build failure with MBEDTLS\_RSA\_C and MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C but not

  MBEDTLS\_PK\_PARSE\_C. Fixes [#6409](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6409).
* Fix ECDSA verification, where it was not always validating the

  public key. This bug meant that it was possible to verify a

  signature with an invalid public key, in some cases. Reported by

  Guido Vranken using Cryptofuzz in [#4420](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/4420).
* Fix a possible null pointer dereference if a memory allocation fails

  in TLS PRF code. Reported by Michael Madsen in [#6516](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6516).
* Fix TLS 1.3 session resumption. Fixes [#6488](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6488).
* Add a configuration check to exclude optional client authentication

  in TLS 1.3 (where it is forbidden).
* Fix a bug in which mbedtls\_x509\_crt\_info() would produce non-printable

  bytes when parsing certificates containing a binary RFC 4108

  HardwareModuleName as a Subject Alternative Name extension. Hardware

  serial numbers are now rendered in hex format. Fixes [#6262](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6262).
* Fix bug in error reporting in dh\_genprime.c where upon failure,

  the error code returned by mbedtls\_mpi\_write\_file() is overwritten

  and therefore not printed.
* In the bignum module, operations of the form (-A) - (+A) or (-A) - (-A)

  with A > 0 created an unintended representation of the value 0 which was

  not processed correctly by some bignum operations. Fix this. This had no

  consequence on cryptography code, but might affect applications that call

  bignum directly and use negative numbers.
* Fix a bug whereby the list of signature algorithms sent as part of

  the TLS 1.2 server certificate request would get corrupted, meaning the

  first algorithm would not get sent and an entry consisting of two random

  bytes would be sent instead. Found by Serban Bejan and Dudek Sebastian.
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) of

  mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_mpi(), mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_abs() and mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_int()

  when both operands are 0 and the left operand is represented with 0 limbs.
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) when some bignum

  functions receive the most negative value of mbedtls\_mpi\_sint. Credit

  to OSS-Fuzz. Fixes [#6597](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6597).
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) in PSA ECB

  encryption and decryption.
* Move some SSL-specific code out of libmbedcrypto where it had been placed

  accidentally.
* Fix a build error when compiling the bignum module for some Arm platforms.

  Fixes [#6089](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6089), [#6124](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6124), [#6217](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6217).

Changes

* Add the ability to query PSA\_WANT\_xxx macros to query\_compile\_time\_config.
* Calling AEAD tag-specific functions for non-AEAD algorithms (which

  should not be done - they are documented for use only by AES-GCM and

  ChaCha20+Poly1305) now returns MBEDTLS\_ERR\_CIPHER\_FEATURE\_UNAVAILABLE

  instead of success (0).

## Description

This release of Mbed TLS provides bug fixes and minor enhancements. This release includes fixes for security issues.

Mbed TLS 2.28 is a long-time support branch. It will be supported with bug-fixes and security fixes until end of 2024.

## Security Advisories

There are no security advisories for this release.

## Release Notes

Security

* Fix potential heap buffer overread and overwrite in DTLS if

  MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID is enabled and

  MBEDTLS\_SSL\_CID\_IN\_LEN\_MAX > 2 \* MBEDTLS\_SSL\_CID\_OUT\_LEN\_MAX.
* An adversary with access to precise enough information about memory

  accesses (typically, an untrusted operating system attacking a secure

  enclave) could recover an RSA private key after observing the victim

  performing a single private-key operation if the window size used for the

  exponentiation was 3 or smaller. Found and reported by Zili KOU,

  Wenjian HE, Sharad Sinha, and Wei ZHANG. See "Cache Side-channel Attacks

  and Defenses of the Sliding Window Algorithm in TEEs" - Design, Automation

  and Test in Europe 2023.

Bugfix

* Fix a long-standing build failure when building x86 PIC code with old

  gcc (4.x). The code will be slower, but will compile. We do however

  recommend upgrading to a more recent compiler instead. Fixes [#1910](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/1910).
* Fix support for little-endian Microblaze when MBEDTLS\_HAVE\_ASM is defined.

  Contributed by Kazuyuki Kimura to fix [#2020](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2020).
* Use double quotes to include private header file psa\_crypto\_cipher.h.

  Fixes 'file not found with include' error

  when building with Xcode.
* Fix handling of broken symlinks when loading certificates using

  mbedtls\_x509\_crt\_parse\_path(). Instead of returning an error as soon as a

  broken link is encountered, skip the broken link and continue parsing

  other certificate files. Contributed by Eduardo Silva in [#2602](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/2602).
* Fix a compilation error when using CMake with an IAR toolchain.

  Fixes [#5964](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/5964).
* Fix bugs and missing dependencies when building and testing

  configurations with only one encryption type enabled in TLS 1.2.
* Provide the missing definition of mbedtls\_setbuf() in some configurations

  with MBEDTLS\_PLATFORM\_C disabled. Fixes [#6118](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6118), [#6196](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6196).
* Fix compilation errors when trying to build with

  PSA drivers for AEAD (GCM, CCM, Chacha20-Poly1305).
* Fix memory leak in ssl\_parse\_certificate\_request() caused by

  mbedtls\_x509\_get\_name() not freeing allocated objects in case of error.

  Change mbedtls\_x509\_get\_name() to clean up allocated objects on error.
* Fix checks on PK in check\_config.h for builds with PSA and RSA. This does

  not change which builds actually work, only moving a link-time error to

  an early check.
* Fix ECDSA verification, where it was not always validating the

  public key. This bug meant that it was possible to verify a

  signature with an invalid public key, in some cases. Reported by

  Guido Vranken using Cryptofuzz in [#4420](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/4420).
* Fix a possible null pointer dereference if a memory allocation fails

  in TLS PRF code. Reported by Michael Madsen in [#6516](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6516).
* Fix a bug in which mbedtls\_x509\_crt\_info() would produce non-printable

  bytes when parsing certificates containing a binary RFC 4108

  HardwareModuleName as a Subject Alternative Name extension. Hardware

  serial numbers are now rendered in hex format. Fixes [#6262](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6262).
* Fix bug in error reporting in dh\_genprime.c where upon failure,

  the error code returned by mbedtls\_mpi\_write\_file() is overwritten

  and therefore not printed.
* In the bignum module, operations of the form (-A) - (+A) or (-A) - (-A)

  with A > 0 created an unintended representation of the value 0 which was

  not processed correctly by some bignum operations. Fix this. This had no

  consequence on cryptography code, but might affect applications that call

  bignum directly and use negative numbers.
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) of

  mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_mpi(), mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_abs() and mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_int()

  when both operands are 0 and the left operand is represented with 0 limbs.
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) when some bignum

  functions receive the most negative value of mbedtls\_mpi\_sint. Credit

  to OSS-Fuzz. Fixes [#6597](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6597).
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) in PSA ECB

  encryption and decryption.
