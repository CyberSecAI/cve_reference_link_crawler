## Description

This release of Mbed TLS provides bug fixes and minor enhancements. This release includes fixes for security issues.

Mbed TLS 2.28 is a long-time support branch. It will be supported with bug-fixes and security fixes until end of 2024.

## Security Advisories

There are no security advisories for this release.

## Release Notes

Security

* Fix potential heap buffer overread and overwrite in DTLS if

  MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID is enabled and

  MBEDTLS\_SSL\_CID\_IN\_LEN\_MAX > 2 \* MBEDTLS\_SSL\_CID\_OUT\_LEN\_MAX.
* An adversary with access to precise enough information about memory

  accesses (typically, an untrusted operating system attacking a secure

  enclave) could recover an RSA private key after observing the victim

  performing a single private-key operation if the window size used for the

  exponentiation was 3 or smaller. Found and reported by Zili KOU,

  Wenjian HE, Sharad Sinha, and Wei ZHANG. See "Cache Side-channel Attacks

  and Defenses of the Sliding Window Algorithm in TEEs" - Design, Automation

  and Test in Europe 2023.

Bugfix

* Fix a long-standing build failure when building x86 PIC code with old

  gcc (4.x). The code will be slower, but will compile. We do however

  recommend upgrading to a more recent compiler instead. Fixes [#1910](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/1910).
* Fix support for little-endian Microblaze when MBEDTLS\_HAVE\_ASM is defined.

  Contributed by Kazuyuki Kimura to fix [#2020](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2020).
* Use double quotes to include private header file psa\_crypto\_cipher.h.

  Fixes 'file not found with include' error

  when building with Xcode.
* Fix handling of broken symlinks when loading certificates using

  mbedtls\_x509\_crt\_parse\_path(). Instead of returning an error as soon as a

  broken link is encountered, skip the broken link and continue parsing

  other certificate files. Contributed by Eduardo Silva in [#2602](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/2602).
* Fix a compilation error when using CMake with an IAR toolchain.

  Fixes [#5964](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/5964).
* Fix bugs and missing dependencies when building and testing

  configurations with only one encryption type enabled in TLS 1.2.
* Provide the missing definition of mbedtls\_setbuf() in some configurations

  with MBEDTLS\_PLATFORM\_C disabled. Fixes [#6118](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6118), [#6196](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6196).
* Fix compilation errors when trying to build with

  PSA drivers for AEAD (GCM, CCM, Chacha20-Poly1305).
* Fix memory leak in ssl\_parse\_certificate\_request() caused by

  mbedtls\_x509\_get\_name() not freeing allocated objects in case of error.

  Change mbedtls\_x509\_get\_name() to clean up allocated objects on error.
* Fix checks on PK in check\_config.h for builds with PSA and RSA. This does

  not change which builds actually work, only moving a link-time error to

  an early check.
* Fix ECDSA verification, where it was not always validating the

  public key. This bug meant that it was possible to verify a

  signature with an invalid public key, in some cases. Reported by

  Guido Vranken using Cryptofuzz in [#4420](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/4420).
* Fix a possible null pointer dereference if a memory allocation fails

  in TLS PRF code. Reported by Michael Madsen in [#6516](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6516).
* Fix a bug in which mbedtls\_x509\_crt\_info() would produce non-printable

  bytes when parsing certificates containing a binary RFC 4108

  HardwareModuleName as a Subject Alternative Name extension. Hardware

  serial numbers are now rendered in hex format. Fixes [#6262](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6262).
* Fix bug in error reporting in dh\_genprime.c where upon failure,

  the error code returned by mbedtls\_mpi\_write\_file() is overwritten

  and therefore not printed.
* In the bignum module, operations of the form (-A) - (+A) or (-A) - (-A)

  with A > 0 created an unintended representation of the value 0 which was

  not processed correctly by some bignum operations. Fix this. This had no

  consequence on cryptography code, but might affect applications that call

  bignum directly and use negative numbers.
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) of

  mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_mpi(), mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_abs() and mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_int()

  when both operands are 0 and the left operand is represented with 0 limbs.
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) when some bignum

  functions receive the most negative value of mbedtls\_mpi\_sint. Credit

  to OSS-Fuzz. Fixes [#6597](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6597).
* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) in PSA ECB

  encryption and decryption.
