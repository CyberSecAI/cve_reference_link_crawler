Regex DOS vulnerability report via [@b-c-ds](https://github.com/b-c-ds)

* Fixes two regex via proposed patches
* Band aid on fenced-code-block DOS by limiting the amount of spaces after language specification. Passes tests and common usage.

```
Doyensec Vulnerability Advisory
=======================================================================
* Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS) in python-markdown2
* Affected Product: markdown2 >= 1.0.1.18
* Vendor: https://github.com/trentm
* Severity: Low
* Vulnerability Class: Denial of Service
* Status: Open
* Author(s): Ben Caller (Doyensec)
=======================================================================

=== SUMMARY ===

The python package markdown2 processes markdown using regular expressions which are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS).
If an attacker provides a malicious string, it can make markdown2 get stuck processing for a very long time.

=== TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION ===

The three vulnerable regular expressions are found in markdown2.py. They are used only when specific extras or options are enabled.

Line 894: self.regex_defns
Pattern:
            \[\#(\w+)\s* # the counter.  Open square plus hash plus a word \1
            ([^@]*)\s*   # Some optional characters, that aren't an @. \2
            @(\w+)       # the id.  Should this be normed? \3
            ([^\]]*)\]   # The rest of the text up to the terminating ] \4
Repeated character: \s
Example: '[#a' + ' ' * 3456
Enabled with the 'numbering' extra.
The section \s*([^@]*)\s* contains three infinitely repeating groups which all match space character, so a long string of spaces can cause catastrophic backtracking.
The complexity is cubic, so doubling the length of the malicious string of spaces makes processing take 8 times as long.

Line 1927: _fenced_code_block_re
Pattern:
        (?:\n+|\A\n?)
        ^```\s*?([\w+-]+)?\s*?\n    # opening fence, $1 = optional lang
        (.*?)                       # $2 = code block content
        ^```[ \t]*\n                # closing fence
Repeated character: \n
Example: '```' + '\n' * 3456
Enabled with the 'fenced-code-blocks' extra.
As the ([\w+-]+)? group is optional, the section \s*?([\w+-]+)?\s*?\n(.*?) contains three infinitely repeating groups which all match the new-line character.
Cubic complexity.

Line 535: _emacs_oneliner_vars_pat
Pattern: -\*-\s*([^\r\n]*?)\s*-\*-
Repeated character: \x20, \x09, \xa0
Example: '-*-' + ' ' * 3456
Enabled when `use_file_vars` is True.
The section \s*([^\r\n]*?)s* contains three parts which all match spaces and tabs, so a long string of spaces can cause backtracking.
Cubic complexity.

=== REPRODUCTION STEPS ===

Running any of these commands will take a while to process at 100% CPU.
Doubling the length of the repeating section will make processing take 8 times as long.

markdown2.markdown('[#a' + ' ' * 3456, extras=['numbering'])

markdown2.markdown('```' + '\n' * 3456, extras=['fenced-code-blocks'])

markdown2.markdown('-*-' + ' ' * 3456, use_file_vars=True)

=== REMEDIATION ===

Fix the three vulnerable regexes.

Potential fixes:
  regex_defns: I'd recommend replacing \s*([^@]*)\s* with ([^@]*) and then running .strip() on the result
    text_before = match.group(2).strip()

  _fenced_code_block_re is pretty hard. Line 2 could be something like:
    ^```((?!\n)\s)*?([\w+-]+((?!\n)\s)*)?\n
  using negative lookahead so the \s matches all spaces except newlines
  and moving the second \s inside group 1 so it only matches if a language is chosen.

  _emacs_oneliner_vars_pat:
    -\*-\s*(?:(\S[^\r\n]*?)([\r\n]\s*)?)?-\*-

| Thanks. The change looks good! The `_fenced_code_block_re` is better but it is still quadratic because of `\s*?\n(.*?)`. It would only be a problem on super long strings of newlines now. If you were able to do the same trick of changing `\s*` into `\s{0,99}` it should prevent that issue. Up to you. |

| Yup, it's definitely a band aid, but in manual testing it was at least returning results quickly instead of hanging forever :P  Now that I look again, the second \s\* is *normally* not used either, as the common syntax is to immediately newline, so 99 might even be overkill. Could probably just do another {0,2} to handle that and pass tests and common usage. Will experiment and maybe push another patch. |
