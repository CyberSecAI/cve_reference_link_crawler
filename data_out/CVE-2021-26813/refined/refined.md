Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26813:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from inefficient regular expressions used in the python-markdown2 library. These regexes, when processing specially crafted input strings, can lead to catastrophic backtracking, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
Three specific regular expressions were identified as vulnerable:

1.  `self.regex_defns` (Used with the 'numbering' extra):  The regex `\[\#(\w+)\s*([^@]*)\s*@(\w+)([^\]]*)\]` is vulnerable due to the `\s*([^@]*)\s*`  section, where multiple repeating groups match spaces, leading to excessive backtracking with long strings of spaces.
2.  `_fenced_code_block_re` (Used with 'fenced-code-blocks' extra): The regex `(?:\n+|\A\n?)^```\s*?([\w+-]+)?\s*?\n(.*?)^```[ \t]*\n` is vulnerable as the `\s*?([\w+-]+)?\s*?\n(.*?)` allows repeated newlines to cause backtracking
3.  `_emacs_oneliner_vars_pat`: (Used when `use_file_vars` is True): The regex `-\*-\s*([^\r\n]*?)\s*-\*-` is vulnerable due to the  `\s*([^\r\n]*?)\s*` part, where spaces or tabs can cause excessive backtracking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing specially crafted input strings to the markdown processing functions of the library. This can lead to:
*   High CPU usage
*   Prolonged processing times
*   Unresponsive application

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves feeding malicious markdown strings to the `markdown2.markdown()` function with the vulnerable extras or options enabled, which would trigger the vulnerable regexes. The vulnerable extras are 'numbering' and 'fenced-code-blocks'. The `use_file_vars` option also triggers a vulnerable regex.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to supply input that will be parsed by python-markdown2. The attacker does not need to be local, they can perform this attack remotely if there is an application that uses the vulnerable python-markdown2 library to render user-supplied content.

**Additional Details (From Github content):**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ben Caller (Doyensec).
*   The reported complexity of the vulnerable regexes is cubic, meaning that doubling the length of the malicious string increases processing time eightfold.
*   The fix implemented includes:
    *   Replacing  `\s*([^@]*)\s*`  with  `([^@]*)` and then stripping the result for `self.regex_defns`
    *   Adding a limit to the number of spaces after the language specifier in the `_fenced_code_block_re` regex.
    *   The  `_emacs_oneliner_vars_pat` regex was also modified.
*   The fix for `_fenced_code_block_re` was initially a "band aid," limiting spaces, with a further modification to be more precise with space handling.
