- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Finale Lite plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the website under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the plugin allows a user to perform.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious link or HTML that, when accessed by an authenticated user, triggers the vulnerable action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage, and the user must have sufficient privileges to perform the targeted action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
