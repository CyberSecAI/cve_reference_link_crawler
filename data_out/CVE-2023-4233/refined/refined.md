The content is related to CVE-2023-4233.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow occurs within the `sms_decode_address_field()` function during SMS PDU decoding in ofono, an open-source telephony stack for Linux. The vulnerability is triggered in the `extract_bcd_number()` function due to an unchecked length of the address field extracted from the SMS PDU.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `extract_bcd_number()` function iterates through the buffer provided by the address field from the SMS PDU and writes to a stack-allocated buffer `out`. The length of the data in the SMS PDU is not checked against the length of the output buffer, causing a stack buffer overflow if the provided SMS PDU data is crafted to have a large address field.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious SMS message to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted SMS message. The vulnerability can be reached through a compromised modem, a malicious base station, or just a normal SMS message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send SMS messages to the target device, either through direct access via a compromised modem, an attacker-controlled base station, or by sending an SMS message.
