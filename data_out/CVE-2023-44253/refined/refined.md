Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-44253:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer handle websocket requests. Specifically, error messages generated by the server when a user requests an ADOM (Administrative Domain) ID that doesn't correspond to their assigned ADOM, inadvertently disclose the name of the existing ADOM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure (CWE-200):**  The system exposes sensitive information (ADOM names) in error messages to unauthorized users.
- **Insecure Error Handling:** The error messages are overly verbose, revealing details that could be used to map the system's internal structure and potentially lead to further attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can enumerate existing ADOM names. Since ADOM names often reflect customer names, this could lead to the leakage of sensitive customer information.
- **Further Attack Vector:** Information gleaned from this vulnerability can be used as part of a larger attack by helping attackers understand the structure of their target's systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network using crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests via websockets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an active account with read-only (RO) or read-write (RW) access to at least one ADOM.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected system.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Exploitation Method:** The attacker manipulates the websocket requests, specifically incrementing an ID parameter, to trigger error messages that reveal ADOM names.
*   **Vulnerable Products:** FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer, including FortiAnalyzer-BigData, are affected.
*   **Affected Versions:** The content lists specific affected and fixed versions for different products.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 4.7, considered a medium severity.
*   **Fix:**  The recommended fix is to upgrade to the specified patched versions of the products.
*   **Mitigation:** The provided solution recommendation is to ensure error messages do not contain detailed information about the requested item.
