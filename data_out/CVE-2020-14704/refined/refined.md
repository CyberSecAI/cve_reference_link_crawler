{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability results from the lack of proper initialization of memory within the BusLogicSCSI component before accessing it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with high privileges in the guest system can disclose sensitive information from the hypervisor's memory. This can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to execute code within the context of the hypervisor.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access within the guest operating system"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must first have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system to exploit the vulnerability."
