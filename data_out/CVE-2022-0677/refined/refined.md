- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of length parameter inconsistency in the Bitdefender Update Server component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way the Bitdefender Update Server handles length parameters, leading to a potential denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges are required (PR:N) and no user interaction is needed (UI:N). The attack does not require a special scope (S:U).
