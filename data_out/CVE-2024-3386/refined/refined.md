- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect string comparison in PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The incorrect string comparison prevents Predefined Decryption Exclusions from functioning correctly.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Traffic destined for domains that are not specified in Predefined Decryption Exclusions may be unintentionally excluded from decryption. This could allow an attacker to bypass decryption controls.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker does not need any special access to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can be positioned anywhere on the network as long as they can send traffic through the affected firewall. No special privileges are required.
