fix: Parse installation config path more robustly

[Browse files](/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/tree/650a1b5cf25e086197cc55a68525a411e1c28031)

```
This adds the `-z`/`--null` and `--name-only` options in the `git`
invocation that tries to obtain the configuration file path
associated with the `git` installation itself. The benefits are:

- Parsing is more reliable for paths containing unusual characters,
  because `-z`/`--null` causes all paths to be output literally.

  Previously, `"` characters were trimmed from the ends, but this
  would not always extract a correct path, because when a path
  contains characters that cause `git` to enclose it in double
  quotes, those characters are usually represented in a symbolic
  form, usually with `\` escapes.

  In some scenarios, such as usually on Windows when the escaped
  character is itself a `\` and not in the leading position, the
  mangled path would be usable, but more often it would not.

- The volume of output is less, because `--name-only` casues values
  not to be included in the output.

- The combination of `-z`/`--null` and `--name-only` makes the
  output format simpler, and the parsing logic is accordingly
  simpler.

`git` has supported the `-z`/`--null` and `--name-only` options
even before support for `--show-origin` was added in Git 2.8.0, so
this change should have no effect on Git version compatibility.
