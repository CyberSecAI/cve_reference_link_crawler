Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue within the WooCommerce Multilingual & Multicurrency plugin. This indicates missing or insufficient authorization checks in the plugin's code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The core vulnerability lies in the failure to properly restrict access to certain functionalities, allowing unprivileged users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to. The specific vulnerable function is not detailed, but the vulnerability description mentions it leads to an unprivileged user executing a "higher privileged action"

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is described as "low severity" and "unlikely to be exploited," but could allow an unprivileged user (specifically "Subscriber") to perform actions they are not authorized to do. The specific unauthorized actions are not detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the WordPress plugin itself, and more specifically, by interacting with the vulnerable function that lacks proper access controls.
*   The attacker likely needs to be a registered user (at least a subscriber) to perform the unauthorized action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site.
*   No other specifics about the attacker's requirements are stated, beyond the fact that they must be able to trigger the vulnerable functionality, which could vary depending on how the plugin works.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 5.3.4 of the plugin and is fixed in version 5.3.5.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Rafie Muhammad (Patchstack).
