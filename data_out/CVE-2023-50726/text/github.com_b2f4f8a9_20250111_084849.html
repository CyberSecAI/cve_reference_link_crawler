# Users with `create` but not `override` privileges can perform local sync

Moderate

## Package

gomod

github.com/argoproj/argo-cd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

1.2.0-rc1 through 2.10.2, 2.9.7, 2.8.11

## Patched versions

2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12

## Description

### Impact

"Local sync" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git.

An improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is *not* enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source.

The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added.

### Patches

The bug has been patched in the following versions:

* 2.10.3
* 2.9.8
* 2.8.12

### Workarounds

To immediately mitigate the risk of branch protection bypass, remove `applications, create` RBAC access. The only way to eliminate the issue without removing RBAC access is to upgrade to a patched version.

Branch protection rules and review requirements are a great way to enforce security constraints in a GitOps environment, but they should be just one layer in a multi-layered approach. Make sure your AppProject and RBAC restrictions are as thorough as possible to prevent a review bypass vulnerability from permitting excessive damage.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
