Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   An improper validation bug in Argo CD allows users with `create` privileges, but without `override` privileges, to bypass intended restrictions and sync local manifests during application creation.
*   The vulnerability exists because Argo CD does not properly prevent setting an operation (which includes manifests for local sync) during application creation if done through API calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization/Privilege Escalation:** Users with `create` access can bypass the intended restriction of needing the `override` privilege when creating a new application. This allows users to use local manifests even if they shouldn't.
*   **Bypass of GitOps Protections:** The local sync feature allows bypassing merge protections in git, which is intended for highly trusted users, but it is exposed to a wider range of users through this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Branch Protection:** Attackers can bypass branch protection rules (which usually enforce reviews and security checks) and deploy arbitrary manifests. They can achieve this by using local manifests which allows them to skip checks related to source control.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution/Compromise:** By injecting malicious manifests, an attacker could potentially compromise the target environment.
*   **Compromised Application State:** Attackers could modify the application's desired state, leading to unpredictable behavior and possible service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Access:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Argo CD API, where a user with `create` privileges sends an application create request containing an operation.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is classified as network, meaning that the vulnerability is exposed remotely and does not require physical access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Argo CD User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account with `create` privileges for applications within Argo CD.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Argo CD API to send malicious requests.
*   **No `override` privileges:** The attacker should not have the `override` privilege for applications, because then it is an expected behaviour of Argo CD.
*   **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker needs only low privileges in order to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 1.2.0-rc1 with the introduction of the local manifest sync feature.
*   The fix involves removing the user-supplied `operation` when processing the application creation request. This prevents users from setting the manifests during app creation and bypassing intended restrictions.
*   The vulnerability is considered moderate in severity.
