Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to the identified CVEs.  Note: Since all the vulnerabilities stem from the same root cause, there is some repetition across the reports.

**Vulnerability Root Cause:**

*   **Unsafe Use of Flask `send_file` Function:** The core vulnerability across all the listed CVEs is the insecure usage of the `flask.send_file` function in various Python Flask-based web applications. Specifically, the function is used to serve files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation, leading to absolute path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue, where attackers can manipulate file paths to access files and directories outside the intended web root directory. This is possible due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input before passing it to the `send_file` function.
*   **Unvalidated User Input:**  The applications fail to validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths. This means that a malicious user could provide an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `../../../../etc/passwd`) rather than a relative path as intended by the developers.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The applications do not properly validate that the provided paths remain within the expected directory structure. This allows an attacker to break out of the intended directory and access other files in the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files, including configuration files, source code, or other application-related data, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, or API keys.
*  **Potential for Limited Availability Impact:** In some cases, attackers might be able to cause a denial of service by requesting access to large files repeatedly, but this is generally not the primary impact. In general, availability is not directly affected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through network requests, where an attacker modifies the URL to contain a malicious file path. For example, an attacker might provide a URL containing sequences like `../` or an absolute path to escape the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** In most cases, the attacker does not need any special credentials or user accounts to exploit the vulnerability; they only need to craft a specific request.
*   **Low Complexity:** Exploiting the vulnerability is simple, requiring basic understanding of HTTP requests and file path manipulation.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required by the attacker to launch the attack; they only need to send a maliciously formed request.

**Specific Details from the Content:**

*   **Vulnerable Function:** The `flask.send_file` function is consistently identified as the source of the vulnerability when handling the 'filename' parameter or other parameters relating to a path.
*   **Recommended Fix:**  The recommended mitigation is to avoid the use of `send_file` function with user supplied file paths. Where required, use `flask.safe_join` to validate paths before usage or replace calls with `flask.send_from_directory` which only allows files in a given directory to be served.
*   **Affected Projects:** Several GitHub repositories, primarily Flask-based web applications, are affected. Many of these are personal projects or small tools and not heavily maintained, which makes them susceptible to this type of vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Metrics:** The common CVSS v3 metrics include:
    *   `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None)
    *   `UI:N` (User Interaction: None)
    *   `S:C` (Scope: Changed)
    *   `C:H` (Confidentiality: High)
    *   `I:N` (Integrity: None)
    *   `A:L` (Availability: Low)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub Security Lab discussions (reference #669) repeatedly pointed out the misuse of the `flask.send_file` function.
*   Some discussion revolves around whether CVEs should be assigned to minor/personal projects, given their limited scope and usage. There is an argument that reporting CVEs for such projects can lead to noise and make vulnerability databases harder to use.
