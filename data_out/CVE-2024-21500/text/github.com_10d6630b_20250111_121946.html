### **[ahpaleus](/ahpaleus)** commented [Sep 19, 2023](#issue-1902639112)

| *Severity: Low*  The current implementation of the application‚Äôs two-factor authentication (2FA) lacks sufficient protection against brute-force attacks. Although the application blocks the user after several failed attempts to provide 2FA codes, attackers can bypass this blocking mechanism by automating the application‚Äôs full multistep 2FA process.  To address this issue effectively, enforce a minimum six-digit code length in the MFA configuration. Additionally, to reduce the risk of automated brute-forcing, implement an account locking mechanism that triggers after a specified number of invalid 2FA code attempts. Finally, enforce reauthentication for critical actions involving sensitive account information or security settings. For actions such as changing passwords or disabling 2FA, users should be required to reauthenticate, either with their password or a 2FA token. An exception can be made for reauthentication if the user has logged in within the last 10 minutes. Check out [Getting 2FA Right in 2019](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/06/20/getting-2fa-right-in-2019/) at the Trail of Bits Blog for more information.
