- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Cloud Stream and Edge Stream servers read the entire incoming message into memory without any size limit.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation and resource limits when processing stream messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can send a large message to the Cloud Stream or Edge Stream server, exhausting memory and causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, affecting CloudCore and EdgeCore components.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. An attacker sends a large message to either the Cloud Stream server or the Edge Stream server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. The `cloudStream` module must be enabled in the `cloudcore.yaml` configuration and `edgeStream` module must be enabled in the `edgecore.yaml` configuration.
