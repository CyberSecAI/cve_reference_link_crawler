Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-24786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `protojson.Unmarshal` function of the `google.golang.org/protobuf` library. It can enter an infinite loop when unmarshaling specific forms of invalid JSON.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The `protojson.Unmarshal` function does not properly handle certain invalid JSON inputs, leading to an infinite loop.
- This occurs specifically when unmarshaling into a message containing a `google.protobuf.Any` value or when the `UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown` option is set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The primary impact is a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the infinite loop, which can consume excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through providing a specially crafted, invalid JSON input to the `protojson.Unmarshal` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the JSON input that is being processed by the vulnerable `Unmarshal` function.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The vulnerability is present in the following packages:
    - `google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson` before v1.33.0
    - `google.golang.org/protobuf/internal/encoding/json` before v1.33.0
- The specific functions affected are:
    - `Unmarshal` and `UnmarshalOptions.Unmarshal` in `protojson` package
    - `Decoder.Peek` and `Decoder.Read` in `internal/encoding/json` package
- The fix is to ensure the `Unmarshal` function correctly returns an error when encountering such invalid inputs.
- NetApp has identified that some of their products use the vulnerable Golang library and could be affected. They are investigating and will release patches as needed.
- The vulnerability is rated as HIGH severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
