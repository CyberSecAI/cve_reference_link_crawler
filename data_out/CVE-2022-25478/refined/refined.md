Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-25478:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Realtek SD card reader driver (RtsPer.sys) provides unrestricted access to the PCI configuration space of the device through two IO control codes: `0x2D2190` (for reading) and `0x2D2194` (for writing). These controls act as wrappers for the `GetSetDeviceData` method of the `BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD` driver interface, which is implemented by `pci.sys`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted Access:** The driver allows any user to read and write to the PCI configuration space of the device, with only a restriction to a maximum of 255 bytes at a time. This bypasses intended security boundaries.
- **Lack of Validation:** The driver does not perform adequate validation or sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically the offset within the PCI configuration space to be accessed and the data being written.
- **Direct access to PCI config space:** The driver directly exposes functionality to read/write the PCI configuration space from user mode, without proper restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By writing arbitrary data to the Base Address Registers (BARs) within the PCI configuration header, an attacker can trigger a prolonged interrupt storm (20 minutes) rendering the OS unusable.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While not detailed, the ability to read/write PCI config space could be used for more serious attacks, depending on what is being targeted.

**Attack vectors:**
- **IO Control Codes:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable device driver, specifically through the `IOCTL_READ_PCI_CONFIG` (0x2D2190) and `IOCTL_WRITE_PCI_CONFIG` (0x2D2194) control codes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Non-privileged user:** Any user with access to the device object can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to send IO Control Codes:** The attacker needs the ability to send DeviceIoControl calls with the correct control codes and data.

**Additional details:**
- The driver uses a custom structure `PCIDescriptor` to pass the PCI configuration space offset, length and data to be read/written.
- The driver restricts the read/write length to a maximum of 255 bytes.
- The standard PCI header is defined by `PCI_COMMON_HEADER` and includes, among other things, BARs which can be modified by a user.
- The driver uses `GetSetDeviceData` method to access the config space.
