Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2023-31168:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the "Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere". This indicates that the software incorporates or uses features/data from a source that is not trusted or properly validated, which can lead to unexpected and potentially malicious behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere: The software improperly incorporates external data/features without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can embed malicious instructions within the software. These instructions could then be executed by an authorized device operator, potentially leading to a variety of malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to introduce the untrusted functionality into the application. The specific way this is done is not described but could include file manipulation, network-based injection, or other means to inject the malicious instructions.
*   The vulnerable software is the Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories SEL-5030 acSELerator QuickSet Software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to inject or embed malicious instructions into the QuickSet Software (the exact method is not detailed).
*   The attacker does not necessarily require direct access to the target machine. The attack vector involves embedding malicious code within a data or configuration file processed by the software that will be executed later by a legitimate authorized user.
*   The attacker relies on an authorized device operator to execute the malicious code after it has been embedded

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects SEL-5030 acSELerator QuickSet Software versions up to and including 7.1.3.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gabriele Quagliarella of Nozomi Networks.
*   Further details are available in the Instruction Manual Appendix A and Appendix E dated 20230615.
