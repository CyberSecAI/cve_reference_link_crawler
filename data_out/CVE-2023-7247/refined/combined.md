## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Login as User or Customer <= 3.8 - Admin Account Takeover

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users to log in as any other user on the site.

### Proof of Concept

1. As an admin, log in as some user. Note the user ID.
2. Run the following `curl` command, filling in the `ADMIN\_ID` and the `USER\_ID`:
```
curl -v https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php -H 'Cookie: wordpress\_test\_cookie=WP%20Cookie%20check; wploginas\_new\_user\_id=USER\_ID; loginas\_old\_user\_id=ADMIN\_ID' -d 'action=loginas\_return\_admin'
```
- Note that this `curl` command has to come from the same IP address as the Admin originally used to switch to the user. The attacker may use the `Client-IP` header to fake their IP address if needed.
3. In the response, note the final `Set-Cookie` headers setting the `wordpress\_sec\_...` and `wordpress\_logged\_in\_...` cookies (note that these cookies may be different if you are using `http` instead of `https`.
4. In your browser console in a logged-out tab, manually set those two cookies.
5. Visit `/wp-admin` and see that you are logged in as the admin user.
