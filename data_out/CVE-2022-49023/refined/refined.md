Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing length check when comparing vendor-specific Information Elements (IEs) in the `cfg80211` subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the code assumes that vendor IEs always contain at least 5 octets after the element ID and length fields, without verifying if the length field actually indicates a buffer of that size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow. When comparing vendor IEs, the code unconditionally accesses 5 bytes beyond the IE header (bytes at offset 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) using `memcmp()`. If a crafted vendor IE has a length field that is less than 5 (i.e., `tmp_old[1]` or `tmp[1]` is less than 5) , this leads to reading out of the bounds of the provided buffer, potentially leading to a crash or other unpredictable behavior.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation on the length of the vendor IEs before attempting to compare the contents, causing the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a crash or other unpredictable behavior of the Wi-Fi subsystem, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential for Code Execution**:  Although not explicitly mentioned, memory corruption vulnerabilities such as this can, under some circumstances, be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution. This would require more sophisticated exploitation techniques that are outside of the scope of this patch.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Wi-Fi Beacon/Probe Response:** A malicious actor can craft a Wi-Fi beacon or probe response that contains a vendor-specific IE with a length field less than 5. When a vulnerable device scans for Wi-Fi networks and processes the malicious frame, the buffer overflow vulnerability is triggered during the IE comparison within cfg80211 subsystem.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack could inject or modify the vendor IEs in transit between a Wi-Fi client and access point to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be in the wireless range of a vulnerable device to send malicious Wi-Fi frames (beacon, probe response, etc.) or be in a position to perform a MitM attack.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft a custom Wi-Fi beacon or probe response with a specifically crafted vendor IE to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability exists within the `cfg80211_gen_new_ie` function of the `net/wireless/scan.c` file of the Linux kernel
- The fix adds a length check to ensure that the IE is long enough before comparing its contents, i.e. the fix adds `tmp_old[1] >= 5 && tmp[1] >= 5 &&` before the `memcmp`.
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernels that include the vulnerable code since commit `0b8fb8235be8 ("cfg80211: Parsing of Multiple BSSID information in scanning")`

The patch is present in multiple branches. This indicates this is a relatively widespread vulnerability that affects a range of Linux kernel versions.
