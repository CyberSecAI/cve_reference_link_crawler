The WPS Telegram Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'Wps_Telegram_Chat_Admin::check–°onnection' function in versions up to, and including, 4.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to have full access to the Telegram Bot API endpoint and communicate with it.
