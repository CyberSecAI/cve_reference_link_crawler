The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47295.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `tcindex_partial_destroy_work()` function due to a failure to free the perfect hash when a new `tcindex_data` structure is allocated and the old one is being destroyed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The `perfect` hash is not freed when the `tcindex_data` structure is being destroyed. Specifically, in the function `tcindex_partial_destroy_work()`, the `p->perfect` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeatedly triggering the allocation and deallocation of `tcindex_data` structures without freeing the associated `perfect` hash could lead to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `tcindex_set_parms()` function where a new `tcindex_data` is allocated, and the old one is destroyed via `tcindex_partial_destroy_work()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `tcindex_set_parms()` function, which implies the ability to interact with the traffic control (tc) subsystem. This could be a local user with sufficient privileges or potentially via network interaction.
