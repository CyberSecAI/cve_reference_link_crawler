- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The BAYEUX_BROWSER cookie, generated by the Cometd server, was not configured with the 'Secure' and 'HttpOnly' flags in older versions. This could allow the cookie to be accessed by unauthorized parties over insecure channels, or via javascript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The absence of the 'Secure' and 'HttpOnly' flags on the BAYEUX_BROWSER cookie. This exposes the cookie to potential theft or manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially steal or manipulate the BAYEUX_BROWSER cookie, leading to unauthorized access or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could intercept the cookie over an insecure channel (if the 'Secure' flag is not set) or via a Cross-Site Scripting attack (if 'HttpOnly' flag is not set).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic or inject malicious javascript into the victim's browser.
