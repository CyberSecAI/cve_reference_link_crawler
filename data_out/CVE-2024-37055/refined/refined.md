{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `_load_model` function within `pmdarima/__init__.py`. This function uses `pickle.load()` to deserialize a model from a file path. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious pickle object that will execute arbitrary code when deserialized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker injects a malicious pickle object into a model file, which is then logged to the tracking server using `pmdarima.log_model()`. When a victim loads the model using `mlflow.pmdarima.load_model()`, the malicious pickle object is deserialized, executing the attacker's code."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious model, and log it to an MLflow tracking server, which would require access to the MLflow environment.  The victim needs to load the model from the tracking server."
