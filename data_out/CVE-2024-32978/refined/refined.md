- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure file permissions in the Kaminari gem for Ruby on Rails. Specifically, certain files within the gem have overly permissive file permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Files within the gem were created with permissions that allow unauthorized write access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized write access to Ruby files managed by the library could lead to alteration of application behavior or data integrity issues.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by manual download and decompression of affected versions. Users who use `gem install` command or `bundle install` are not affected.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to download the affected version manually and have the ability to alter files on the server, which implies that the attacker has access to the server's filesystem and the ability to modify file permissions.
