{
  "CVE-2020-36741": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in various WordPress plugins and themes. The code uses conditional checks that fail to verify the presence of a nonce value, and therefore does not check if it is valid.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick an innocent end user into submitting a web request that they did not intend. This can lead to actions being performed on the website that include inadvertent client or server data leakage, change of session state, or manipulation of an end userâ€™s account. Specific impacts include settings change, configuration import and modification of data in the database, and submission of arbitrary comments.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to create a malicious web page that sends a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker would then need to trick an authenticated user (e.g. admin) into visiting the malicious page while they are logged into the vulnerable site.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page and to trick a logged-in user into visiting it."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MultiVendorX plugin has insufficient nonce validation in the `submit_comment()` function.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to missing or incorrect nonce validation.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can submit comments via a forged request if they can trick a site administrator into performing an action like clicking a link.",
      "Attack vectors": "A forged request initiated from a malicious website, requiring a logged-in admin to click a crafted link.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious webpage and to trick an authenticated admin user into visiting it."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "In numerous plugins and themes, a consistent vulnerability lies in the improper implementation of nonce verification. The vulnerability arises from conditional statements where the nonce is only checked if it is set, allowing attackers to bypass the security check by simply omitting the nonce parameter from the request.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to inadequate nonce validation.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The exploitation could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as changing settings, modifying data, or submitting comments on behalf of an authenticated user. The impact varies from low to high severity.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious web page that sends a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site without including a nonce, and tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting that page.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create a malicious web page and trick a logged-in user into visiting it."
