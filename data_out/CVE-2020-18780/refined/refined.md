The provided content describes a heap-use-after-free vulnerability in NASM (Netwide Assembler).

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is located in the `new_Token` function within `asm/preproc.c`. A token is allocated and then freed, but a subsequent operation attempts to access the freed memory.

**Vulnerability:**
- **Type:** Heap-use-after-free.
- **Location:** `asm/preproc.c` in the `new_Token` function (specifically line 1221 and subsequent free at line 1232, according to the provided stack trace).

**Impact:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause a crash due to memory corruption, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted assembly file, specifically when expanding a string macro in the preprocessor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted assembly file that includes a specific macro definition that triggers the use-after-free condition during assembly.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report provides a stack trace that points to the `new_Token`, `expand_smacro`, and `pp_getline` functions in `asm/preproc.c`, as well as functions in `nasm.c` and `libc`. The crash occurs when `strlen` attempts to read freed memory.
- The affected version is 2.14.02.
- The bug report was marked as a duplicate of bug 3392711, which is a heap-buffer-overflow. This indicates a similar underlying issue in macro processing.
