Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read error when handling "Doc objects" in PDF-XChange Editor. Specifically, a read operation is triggered beyond the allocated memory for the object due to actions performed via JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data past the boundary of allocated memory.
- Improper handling of Doc objects within the JavaScript context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can potentially read sensitive information from the process's memory space.
-  The advisory notes that this vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process, though this CVE specifically refers to the information disclosure aspect.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file containing the specially crafted Doc object and JavaScript code to trigger the vulnerability.
- Malicious Web Page: The victim needs to visit a malicious web page that attempts to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF or entice a user to visit a malicious web page.
- The attacker needs to know how to create a malformed Doc object and JavaScript code that exploits the out-of-bounds read condition in PDF-XChange Editor.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability because the target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious web page.
- The vulnerability is fixed in a PDF-XChange update.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
