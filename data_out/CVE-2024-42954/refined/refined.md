- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `fromwebExcptypemanFilter` function of Tenda FH1201 firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `sprintf` function is used to construct a string that can overflow the destination buffer. The function uses a user-controlled `page` parameter from a POST request without adequate size checks. Specifically, the line `sprintf(v8, "firewall_murlexcplist.asp?page=%s", v3);` is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to a crash or potentially remote code execution by overflowing the `v8` buffer, overwriting return addresses and potentially executing arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can send a POST request to the `/goform/webExcptypemanFilter` endpoint with a large value in the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device's web interface. This would usually be a user connected to the same local network as the vulnerable device.
