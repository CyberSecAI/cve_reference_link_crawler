Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46722:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A logic issue exists within the "Assets" component of macOS.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks or improper handling of logic within the Assets component.
*   **Impact:** An application can exploit this vulnerability to modify protected parts of the file system. This could allow a malicious application to escalate privileges, alter system settings, or install malicious software.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious application needs to be present on the targeted system.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have the ability to execute a malicious application on the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details from `exploit.m` (github.com):**

The provided code `exploit.m` shows a proof-of-concept exploit targeting this CVE, with the following steps:
1. It waits for the OS to download an OTA update package using `spin_for_log` function and searches log for "Deleting obsolete paths in parallel..." string.
2. It enumerates the assets directory (`/System/Library/AssetsV2/com_apple_MobileAsset_MacSoftwareUpdate/`) to find the current asset's tmp name.
3. It extracts the post.bom file, which describes what to install.
4. It copies the kernel and BootKernelExtensions, modifies the strings "Darwin Kernel Version" within those binaries to "Hacked By Mickey Jin", calculates the cksum of the modified kernel and BootKernelExtensions, and replaces the original hashes in the post.bom file using `sed`, so that it installs the modified kernel, finally using `mkbom` to re-create the modified post.bom.
5. Then it moves the replaced post.bom and the modified kernel to the relevant directories using a primitive to bypass SIP (`/tmp/sip_mv` is assumed to be another executable that can bypass System Integrity Protection).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit code demonstrates a **System Integrity Protection (SIP) bypass** as part of the vulnerability exploitation process. By modifying the `post.bom` file and replacing the kernel binary, the exploit showcases a way to overwrite the kernel, which should have been protected by SIP.
* The exploit code uses `cksum` to obtain file hashes and `sed` to modify the `post.bom` file content.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-46722 in macOS's Assets component allows for the modification of protected parts of the filesystem by exploiting a logic issue. A malicious app, possibly leveraging the ability to trigger the download of a software update, can execute this vulnerability. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with system privileges via the replacement of system files. The included exploit code on github gives an insight into how such an attack could be performed by manipulating OTA update files and bypassing SIP.
