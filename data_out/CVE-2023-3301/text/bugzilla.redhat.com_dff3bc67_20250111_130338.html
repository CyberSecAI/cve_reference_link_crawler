| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2215784#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-06-18 17:02:39 UTC  ``` The async nature of the hot-unplug enables an easy to reproduce race scenario where the net device backend is cleared before the virtio-net pci frontend has been unplugged (or the ACPI unplug has been acked by the guest?). The guest can use this time window to, at least, trigger an assertion.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2215784#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-08-01 13:09:41 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2228125](show_bug.cgi?id=2228125 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-3301 qemu: net: triggerable assertion due to race condition in hot-unplug [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2215784#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-08-01 13:13:01 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/a0d7215e339b61c7d7a7b3fcf754954d80d93eb8>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2215784#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-14 15:18:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:6980 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6980](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A6980)   ``` |  |
