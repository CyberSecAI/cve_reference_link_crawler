In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: scarlett2: Add missing error check to scarlett2_usb_set_config()

scarlett2_usb_set_config() calls scarlett2_usb_get() but was not
checking the result. Return the error if it fails rather than
continuing with an invalid value.
