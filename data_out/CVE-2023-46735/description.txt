Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Starting in version 6.0.0 and prior to version 6.3.8, the error message in `WebhookController` returns unescaped user-submitted input. As of version 6.3.8, `WebhookController` now doesn't return any user-submitted input in its response.
