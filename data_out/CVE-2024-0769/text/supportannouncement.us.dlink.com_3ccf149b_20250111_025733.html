DIR-859 :: All Revisions :: All Firmware :: End-of-Life / End-of-Service :: Multiple Reported Vulnerabilities

**Overview**

The DIR-859, all hardware revisions, have reached their End of Life ("EOL") /End of Service Life ("EOS") Life-Cycle.  D-Link US recommends D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS, to be retired and replaced. Please contact your regional office for recommendations ([LINK](https://us.dlink.com/en/change-region)).

As a  general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for these products cease.  **Please read information and recommendations****below**.

**3rd Party Report information**

    - **Reports provided:**

          - **Report 1:** CVE-2024-0769 : [Link](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0769) NVD: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

- Public Disclosure : [LINK](https://github.com/pexmee/d-link-dir-859-vulnerabilities-poc)

- Related to [CVE-2019–20213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20213). This vulnerability suggests access to arbitrary files via AUTHORIZED\_GROUP=1. However, it is not only possible to get files; the vulnerability may allow a malicious user exploit to perform a denial of service attack or perform further exploits on the device.

                         - This exploit may be exploited as a path traversal vulnearbility and retrieve ***any*** file ending with '.xml.php

Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
