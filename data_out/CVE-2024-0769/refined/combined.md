DIR-859 :: All Revisions :: All Firmware :: End-of-Life / End-of-Service :: Multiple Reported Vulnerabilities

**Overview**

The DIR-859, all hardware revisions, have reached their End of Life ("EOL") /End of Service Life ("EOS") Life-Cycle.  D-Link US recommends D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS, to be retired and replaced. Please contact your regional office for recommendations ([LINK](https://us.dlink.com/en/change-region)).

As a  general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for these products cease.  **Please read information and recommendations****below**.

**3rd Party Report information**

    - **Reports provided:**

          - **Report 1:** CVE-2024-0769 : [Link](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0769) NVD: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

                   -  Lab-C2DC - Laboratory of Command and Control and Cyber-security

- Disclosed : 01/20/2024

- CWD-22 : Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

                          - Author Public Disclsoure [Link](https://github.com/c2dc/cve-reported/blob/main/CVE-2024-0769/CVE-2024-0769.md)

                          - Security Affairs - 3rd Party Block: [Link](https://securityaffairs.com/165045/hacking/d-link-dir-859-actively-exploited.html)

- **Report 2:** Unauthenticated Information Disclosure" in Firmware v1.07b03\_beta or low are affected.

- Peter Yliniemi :: pyl \_at\_ outpost24 \_dot\_ com

- Public Disclosure : [LINK](https://github.com/pexmee/d-link-dir-859-vulnerabilities-poc)

- Related to [CVE-2019–20213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20213). This vulnerability suggests access to arbitrary files via AUTHORIZED\_GROUP=1. However, it is not only possible to get files; the vulnerability may allow a malicious user exploit to perform a denial of service attack or perform further exploits on the device.

                         - This exploit may be exploited as a path traversal vulnearbility and retrieve ***any*** file ending with '.xml.php

**Affected Models**

| **Model** | **Region** | **Hardware Revision** | **End of Support** | **Legacy Website** | **Last Updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DIR-859 | US | All Series H/W Revisions | 12/10/2020 | Yes ([Link](https://legacy.us.dlink.com/pages/product.aspx?id=a64612142a3041d98642960e5f840fb6)) | 01/19/2024 |

Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
