{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Java object deserialization issue in Jackrabbit webapp/standalone due to the presence of an exploitable class (from commons-beanutils) on the classpath.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
       "Exposure of RMI services"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "RMI-specific TCP port (default 1099)",
       "RMI-over-HTTP (default path '/rmi')"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Network access to the vulnerable Jackrabbit service. Ability to send malicious serialized Java objects via RMI."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Apache Jackrabbit Webapp (jackrabbit-webapp) 2.21.0 before 2.21.18",
    "Apache Jackrabbit Webapp (jackrabbit-webapp) 1.0.0 before 2.20.11",
    "Apache Jackrabbit Standalone (jackrabbit-standalone and jackrabbit-standalone-components) 2.21.0 before 2.21.18",
    "Apache Jackrabbit Standalone (jackrabbit-standalone and jackrabbit-standalone-components) 1.0.0 before 2.20.11"
  ],
  "remediation": "Users are advised to immediately update to versions 2.20.11 or 2.21.18. Additionally, RMI access should be disabled by modifying the `web.xml` and `bootstrap.properties` configuration files.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present due to the 'commons-beanutils' component that contains a class that can be used for remote code execution over RMI.  Even if Jackrabbit itself is patched, adding other components with exploitable classes can reintroduce the same vulnerability. Disabling RMI is recommended."
