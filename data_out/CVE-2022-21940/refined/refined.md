Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21940:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The System Configuration Tool (SCT) versions 14 and 15 are vulnerable due to a missing 'Secure' attribute on a sensitive cookie during an HTTPS session.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  * **CWE-614:** Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute. The application transmits a sensitive cookie over HTTPS without setting the 'Secure' attribute.

**Impact of exploitation:**
   * An attacker could potentially gain access to the user's cookies.
   * With access to the cookies, an attacker can take over the user's session and gain control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
   * Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. While XSS is mentioned as a prerequisite, the document does not detail an XSS vulnerability.  The primary vulnerability is the missing 'Secure' flag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   * The attacker needs to be able to execute a cross-site scripting attack.
   * The attack is exploitable remotely, meaning the attacker doesn't need physical access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Johnson Controls' System Configuration Tool (SCT) versions 14 and 15.
*   The provided CVSS v3 score is 7.5 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact with a high attack complexity and user interaction required.
*   Johnson Controls has released patches for the vulnerability in SCT versions 14.2.3 and 15.0.3.
*   CISA recommends minimizing network exposure for all control system devices and ensuring they are not accessible from the Internet.
