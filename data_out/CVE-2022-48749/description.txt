In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: invalid parameter check in dpu_setup_dspp_pcc

The function performs a check on the "ctx" input parameter, however, it
is used before the check.

Initialize the "base" variable after the sanity check to avoid a
possible NULL pointer dereference.
