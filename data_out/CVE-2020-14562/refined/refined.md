Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-14562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2020-14562 is an issue in OpenJDK's handling of memory allocation when reading TIFF image files. Specifically, there's an improper check or missing validation in how the software processes TIFF files, which leads to a memory allocation issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of memory allocation during TIFF image file processing.
- Insufficient or missing validation of TIFF data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by providing a malicious TIFF image, causing excessive memory allocation, leading to a denial-of-service condition, where the affected Java application or service crashes or becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted TIFF image files.
- Network-based attacks or local file attacks by sending crafted TIFF images to the vulnerable OpenJDK applications

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious TIFF image file to a vulnerable application, either through a network or by making a local file available.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Java SE (11.0.7, 14.0.1).
- The vulnerability is related to JDK-8233239.
- Several of the provided sources mention this vulnerability being part of a larger set of vulnerabilities fixed in a July 2020 patch update for OpenJDK.
- The vulnerability is rated as "MEDIUM" in severity by Oracle.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202008-24 indicates that the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary execution of code, which might indicate the impact could be worse, or it may be related to a larger collection of vulns. The Oracle advisory says only DoS.
