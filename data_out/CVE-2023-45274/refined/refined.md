- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SendPulse Free Web Push WordPress plugin <= 1.3.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in the plugin settings or other sensitive operations.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would execute the unwanted action in the context of that user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to entice a logged-in user to trigger a malicious request.
