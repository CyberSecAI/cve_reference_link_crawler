Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a remote code injection/execution issue in DrayTek Linux routers.
*   It is triggered through the `cvmcfgupload` CGI script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Injection:** The `cvmcfgupload` CGI script does not properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
*   **Command Injection:** Specifically, the filename parameter within a multipart/form-data POST request can be manipulated to inject shell commands

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected DrayTek router.
*   Full compromise of device with potential data exfiltration or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed through HTTP POST request to a specific CGI script: `/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi/cvmcfgupload`
*   The vulnerable parameter is within the multipart/form-data part of the POST request, specifically the filename field
    of a form parameter named "abc"
*   The content type for the payload is `text/x-python-script` which suggests the device is executing this as a shell command

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected DrayTek router's web interface.
*   No authentication is needed, as the exploit is within the unauthenticated CGI script.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit was reported to DrayTek on 04/13/2020 and acknowledged on the same day.
*   A new version of the firmware addressing this issue was released on 06/18/2020.
*   The advisory from DrayTek lists this CVE alongside CVE-2020-14472 with the same description.
*   The Proof of Concept (PoC) provided shows how to inject commands through the filename in a multipart form data request.
*   The PoC includes a method for validating successful execution:  `echo '1_'` injected into a filename.
