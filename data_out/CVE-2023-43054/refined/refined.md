- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the RPE (Rational Publishing Engine) report widget in IBM Engineering Test Management. The vulnerability stems from the way the RPE report widget handles user-supplied data, which can be manipulated to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities within the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when an RPE report is run from within IBM Engineering Test Management. An attacker could inject malicious scripts within the report data, which would be stored and then executed when another user views the report through the RPE report widget.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious data into the RPE report which can then be stored by the system.
