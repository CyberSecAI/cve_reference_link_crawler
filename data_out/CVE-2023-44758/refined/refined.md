- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Page Title" field allows injecting JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the web page. This can lead to various malicious activities, including stealing cookies, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the website or further attacks on a user system.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious script and injecting it into the "Page Title" field of the CMS, an attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the CMS's "Outils d'Ã©dition" (editing tools) or a similar interface where they can modify the "Page Title". They need to be able to input and save the crafted payload in the affected field.
