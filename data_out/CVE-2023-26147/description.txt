All versions of the package ithewei/libhv are vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting when untrusted user input is used to build headers values. An attacker can add the \r\n (carriage return line feeds) characters to end the HTTP response headers and inject malicious content, like for example additional headers or new response body, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.
