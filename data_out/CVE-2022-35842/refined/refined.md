- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Telnet service is enabled on the SSL-VPN interface, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to access sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability [CWE-200]. The telnet service on the SSL-VPN interface is not properly secured, allowing unauthenticated access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can gain information about LDAP and SAML settings configured in FortiOS. This could potentially lead to further attacks or compromise of user accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can use telnet on the SSL-VPN interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SSL-VPN interface. No authentication is required.
