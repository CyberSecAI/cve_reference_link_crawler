Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improperly implemented URL check within the `wpsm_coming_soon_redirect` function of the "Coming Soon Page & Maintenance Mode" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to adequately restrict access when maintenance or coming-soon mode is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks before displaying the website content. The plugin attempts to restrict access based on a whitelist of URLs and logged-in user status, but this logic can be bypassed by unauthenticated users.
*   **Inadequate URL Check:** The plugin uses `wp_parse_url` and `trailingslashit` on `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` to determine the requested URL, which is then compared against a hardcoded whitelist and checked for a `/wp-login.php` string, but the way it is implemented allows bypassing the intended maintenance/coming soon mode.
* **Bypass of Maintenance Mode:** The faulty logic in the `wpsm_coming_soon_redirect` function fails to properly redirect requests when the coming soon or maintenance mode is activated, allowing an unauthorized bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Content:** An unauthenticated attacker can bypass the maintenance or coming soon page and view the full website content. This could expose sensitive information, content not intended to be publicly available, or information about the site structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending HTTP requests to a vulnerable website.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack does not require prior authentication or privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **No Prior Knowledge:** No prior knowledge of the site or specific credentials are required. The attacker simply has to browse to the website, bypassing the maintenance mode restrictions.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `redirect.php` file of the plugin, specifically within the `wpsm_coming_soon_redirect` function.
*   The provided code snippet shows the vulnerable logic involving the whitelist of allowed URLs and the checks for user login status.
*   The fix involves updating to version 2.2.2, where the flawed URL check has been corrected.
*   The CVE is rated as Medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.
