- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The module `opartlimitquantity` has a SQL injection vulnerability due to improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `OpartlimitquantityAlertlimitModuleFrontController::displayAjaxPushAlertMessage()` method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The module directly uses user-supplied data (`$id_product` and `$id_attribute`) in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Obtaining admin access.
    - Removing data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Copying data from sensitive tables to the front end, exposing tokens and unlocking admin's AJAX scripts.
    - Rewriting SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a simple HTTP call to the module's front controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires no privileges and needs no user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. They can trigger the vulnerability remotely over the network. The attacker may conceal the module controller path during the exploit such that only "POST /" is logged in conventional frontend logs.
