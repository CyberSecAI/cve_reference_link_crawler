### Description

The Friends plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.5 via the discover\_available\_feeds function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.

While we check the URL in several other occasions, we didn't check it before trying to discover feeds there. While this is only accessible to authenticated users with higher permissions than `Friends::REQUIRED_ROLE` which is `edit_private_posts`, we still should ensure that the URL is valid according to `wp_http_validate_url()`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
