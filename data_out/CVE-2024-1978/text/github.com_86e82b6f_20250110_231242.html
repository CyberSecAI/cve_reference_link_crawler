While we check the URL in several other occasions, we didn't check it before trying to discover feeds there. While this is only accessible to authenticated users with higher permissions than `Friends::REQUIRED_ROLE` which is `edit_private_posts`, we still should ensure that the URL is valid according to `wp_http_validate_url()`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
