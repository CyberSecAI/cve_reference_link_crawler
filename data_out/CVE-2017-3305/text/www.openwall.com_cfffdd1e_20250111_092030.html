Subject: CVE-2017-3305 - The Riddle vulnerability in MySQL client (public disclosure)

Hi!

There is a new vulnerability in MySQL client versions 5.5 and 5.6 which
is related to SSL/TLS encryption and to older BACKRONYM vulnerability.

As it is common, new vulnerability should have a name, logo and website.
So enjoy the *Riddle* at <http://riddle.link/>

Affected are only Oracle's MySQL clients in all versions 5.5 and 5.6
when SSL/TLS encryption is used. Verification of encryption parameters
and existence of SSL/TLS layer by MySQL client is done *after* client
successfully finish authentication.

For more details including mitigation, look at Technical section on
vulnerability website: <http://riddle.link/>
