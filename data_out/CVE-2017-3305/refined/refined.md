Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the MySQL client library's failure to properly verify SSL/TLS connection parameters *before* completing the authentication process. The client verifies if SSL/TLS encryption is used only *after* successful authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Pre-Authentication SSL/TLS Verification:** The primary weakness is the client's deferred verification of the secure connection. This allows an attacker to intercept the initial handshake and authentication process without a secure connection being established.
*   **SSL Downgrade Attack:**  A man-in-the-middle attacker can leverage the timing issue to force a downgrade from an encrypted SSL connection to an unencrypted plain text connection.
*   **Replay Attack:** The client generates an authentication response even without a verified secure connection. This response can be captured and replayed.
*   **Insecure Password Authentication:** The MySQL protocol's password authentication scheme, allows the attacker to extract a server nonce and send it to the client without the client verifying the source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can successfully capture login credentials and use them to access the MySQL server.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By capturing and replaying the authentication response, an attacker gains access to the MySQL server database.
*   **Arbitrary Error Messages:** The attacker controls the error message sent back to the client after a failed authentication attempt, which can be misleading to the user.
*   **Compromised Data:** Once the attacker is inside the MySQL server, they can access all the data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attack requires the attacker to be positioned between the MySQL client and server, with the ability to modify network communication.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept and modify MySQL protocol communication between the client and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network path between the MySQL client and server.
*   **Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs a solid understanding of the MySQL protocol to manipulate the handshake and authentication process effectively.
*   **Traffic Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the network traffic in order to downgrade the connection from SSL/TLS to unencrypted.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Oracle's MySQL clients versions 5.5 and 5.6.
*   MariaDB client libraries are not affected due to their proper handling of SSL/TLS parameter checks.
*   The vulnerability is named "The Riddle", and is a form of a "BACKRONYM" attack.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading the MySQL client to version 5.7 or by using a different client like MariaDB.
*  The vulnerability is present in code examples provided by Oracle in their documentation related to enforcing SSL encryption. If you follow the code example you will introduce this vulnerability into your application.
