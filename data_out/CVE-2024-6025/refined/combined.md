## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Quiz and Survey Master < 9.0.5 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Quiz settings, which could allow contributors and higher to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1.) Create a new quiz.
2.) Setup a Contact Form and click on Label "Email" settings.
3.) Paste the following payload in the "Allow Domains" textbox.
123" something=' onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be triggered when viewing a Quiz
