- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its quiz settings. Specifically, the "Allow Domains" textbox within the Contact Form settings of a quiz is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users viewing the affected quiz. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, redirecting to malicious sites, stealing sensitive information, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Contributor+ role can create/edit a quiz and insert a malicious script into the vulnerable setting (Allow Domains field in the Email settings under Contact form). The XSS is then triggered when a user views the quiz.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least the Contributor role in WordPress. The attacker also needs to be able to create/edit quizzes in the plugin.
