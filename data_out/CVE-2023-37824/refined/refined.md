    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
    - Display sensitive tables to the front-office
    - Potential for credit card theft through webskimmer deployment
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via HTTP calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction required, making the vulnerability easy to exploit by anonymous users.
