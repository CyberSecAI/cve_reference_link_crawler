SUMMARY

Simcenter Nastran is affected by a stack overflow vulnerability that could be triggered when an application binary reads arbitrary string as a file argument. If a user is tricked to run one of the impacted application binary with a malicious string, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released a new version for Simcenter Nastran 2406 and recommends to update to the latest version. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.
