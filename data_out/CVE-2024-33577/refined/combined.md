SSA-258494: Stack Overflow Vulnerability in Simcenter Nastran before 2406.90

| Publication Date: | 2024-05-14 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-05-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Simcenter Nastran is affected by a stack overflow vulnerability that could be triggered when an application binary reads arbitrary string as a file argument. If a user is tricked to run one of the impacted application binary with a malicious string, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released a new version for Simcenter Nastran 2406 and recommends to update to the latest version. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

SSA-064222: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Simcenter Femap before V2406

| Publication Date: | 2024-07-09 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-07-09 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |

SUMMARY

Simcenter Femap contains multiple file parsing vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads files in IGS, BDF or BMP file formats. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with any of the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released a new version for Simcenter Femap and recommends to update to the latest version.
