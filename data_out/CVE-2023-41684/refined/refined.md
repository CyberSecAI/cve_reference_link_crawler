- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SIS Handball plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into performing an action. The attacker does not require prior authentication on the target system.
