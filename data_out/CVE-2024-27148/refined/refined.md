### Summary of CVE-2024-27148

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is **Incorrect Default Permissions** in Toshiba and Oki Electric Industry MFPs. Specifically, it stems from inadequate access control settings for certain files and directories on the devices. This allows for unauthorized modification and access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Incorrect default permissions (CWE-276). This vulnerability allows a local attacker to overwrite programs running with root privileges
- Multiple files and directories are accessible with weak permissions (777 or 755).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker who can access the affected products may execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local access: An attacker with shell access on the device
- Remote access: An attacker who compromises the device via other vulnerabilities can leverage this issue. The vulnerability could be exploited remotely by uploading a malicious program by leveraging another vulnerability like Pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution as root or apache and multiple Local Privilege Escalations vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Local access (shell access).
- Remote access after initial compromise through other vulnerabilities (e.g. XXE, command injection, insecure file upload).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is one of multiple present in the impacted products.
- The exploitability of this vulnerability is very high due to insecure permission on a number of binaries and libraries in the system.
