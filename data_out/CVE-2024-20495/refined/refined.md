- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of client key data after the TLS session is established in the Remote Access VPN feature of Cisco ASA and FTD software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate validation of client key data after the TLS session is established. This allows for the possibility of sending a crafted key value to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted key value to the affected system over an established secure TLS session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted data over a TLS session to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is required.
