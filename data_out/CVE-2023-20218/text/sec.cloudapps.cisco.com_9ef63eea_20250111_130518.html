For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-spa-web-multi-7kvPmu2F>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected all software releases that were running on Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20181: Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones XSS Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct XSS attacks.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwf04956](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf04956)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20181Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.1CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2023-20218: Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones HTML Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify a web page in the context of a user's browser.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software.
