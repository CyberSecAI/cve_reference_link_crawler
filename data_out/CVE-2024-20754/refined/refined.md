- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to an untrusted search path vulnerability. This means the application may load and execute code from directories that are not safe and controlled by the application developers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves the application searching for and loading resources from an untrusted path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to place a malicious file/library in a location where the application searches for resources. This file would be executed by the application.
