Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `live_mfg.shtml` page of the WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M router's firmware. The page allows unauthorized users to access sensitive router information and execute commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The `live_mfg.shtml` page is accessible to unauthorized users, meaning no authentication is required to access the page and its functionalities.
*   **Command Execution:** The page includes an `exec cmd` function that allows execution of arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain key information about the router.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the router, potentially leading to complete compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router. This could be through the local network or potentially from the internet if the router is exposed.
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing the `live_mfg.shtml` page via an HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have network access to it.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable page.
