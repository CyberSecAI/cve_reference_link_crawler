  "CVE-2023-48031": {
    "description": "Improper File Type Validation vulnerability in the ’api/ticket/comment’ in OpenSupports version 4.11.0 allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions and upload a .bat file by manipulating the file's magic bytes to masquerade as an allowed type. This can enable the attacker to execute arbitrary code or establish a reverse shell, leading to unauthorized file writes or control over the victim's station via a crafted file upload operation.",
    "root_cause": "Improper file type validation in the 'api/ticket/comment' component.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper file type validation",
        "Bypassing security restrictions by manipulating file magic bytes"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution or establishing a reverse shell on the victim's machine, leading to unauthorized file writes and control over the victim's workstation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Uploading a crafted .bat file disguised as an allowed file type by manipulating its magic bytes."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to upload files through the 'api/ticket/comment' endpoint and must be able to craft a file with modified magic bytes."
