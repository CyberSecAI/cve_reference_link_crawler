IMPORTANT: For clusters using VMware vSAN, you must first upgrade the vCenter Server system. Upgrading only ESXi is not supported.

Before an upgrade, always verify in the VMware Product Interoperability Matrix compatible upgrade paths from earlier versions of ESXi, vCenter Server and vSAN to

the current version.

Image Profiles

VMware patch and update releases contain general and critical image profiles. Application of the general release image profile applies to new bug fixes.

Patch Download and Installation

The typical way to apply patches to ESXi hosts is by using the VMware vSphere Update Manager. For details, see About Installing and Administering VMware vSphere

Update Manager.

ESXi hosts can be updated by manually downloading the patch ZIP file from VMware Customer Connect. Navigate to Products and Accounts > Product Patches. From

the Select a Product drop-down menu, select ESXi (Embedded and Installable) and from the Select a Version drop-down menu, select 6.5.0. Install VIBs by using

the esxcli software vib update command. Additionally, the system can be updated by using the image profile and the esxcli software profile update command. For

more information, see vSphere Command-Line Interface Concepts and Examples and vSphere Upgrade Guide.

This patch updates esx-base, esx-tboot, vsan, and vsanhealth VIBs to resolve the following issues:

PR 2976624: When using VMFS snapshots, you might see repeated resets or slow Windows boot time

Due to the slow execution of getLbaStatus command in some environments, when you use VMFS snapshots, you might see repeated resets or slow Windows

boot time. Depending on size of the disk, you might also see VMs to occasionally become unresponsive. The issue is primarily seen on VMs with Windows

version 1809 and later that have VMFS snapshots.

This issue is resolved in this release.

N/A

This patch updates the ntg3 VIB to resolve the following issue:

PR 3004249: You see link flapping on NICs that use the ntg3 driver of version 4.1.3 and later

When two NICs that use the ntg3 driver of versions 4.1.3 and later are connected directly, not to a physical switch port, link flapping might occur. The issue does

not occur on ntg3 drivers of versions earlier than 4.1.3 or the tg3 driver. This issue is not related to the occasional Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) link flapping on

such NICs. The fix for the EEE issue is to use an ntg3 driver of version 4.1.7 or later, or disable EEE on physical switch ports.

This issue is resolved in this release. ESXi650-202210001 comes with ntg3 driver version 4.1.8. However, after you upgrade the ntg3 driver to version 4.1.8, you

must set the new module parameter noPhyStateSet to 1. The noPhyStateSet parameter defaults to 0 and is not required in most environments, except they face the

issue.
