##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and vCenter Server were privately reported to VMware. Updates are available to remediate these vulnerabilities in affected VMware products.

##### **3a. VMware ESXi memory corruption vulnerability (CVE-2022-31696)**

**Description**

VMware ESXi contains a memory corruption vulnerability that exists in the way it handles a network socket. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.5](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with local access to ESXi may exploit this issue to corrupt memory leading to an escape of the ESXi sandbox.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2022-31696 apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**
