## Description of contribution in a few bullet points

## Description of documentation updates required from your changes

### bug description

**costmap** is set as a Nav2::util **LifecycleNode** : [../nav2\_costmap\_2d/include/nav2\_costmap\_2d/costmap\_2d\_ros.hpp#L 73](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_costmap_2d/include/nav2_costmap_2d/costmap_2d_ros.hpp#L73)

all LifecycleNode would react to **Ctrl+C** [../nav2\_util/src/lifecycle\_node.cpp#L 90](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_util/src/lifecycle_node.cpp#L90)

all LifecycleNode would react to rcl\_preshutdown **randomly**, and similar issue has been discussed before : [../ros2/rclcpp/issues/2096](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2096)

this explanation should have been clear enough: [../nav2\_planner/src/planner\_server.cpp #L 214-L225](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_planner/src/planner_server.cpp#L214-L225)

**the bug happening in [ISSUE: #3958](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/pull/3958) is caused by this.**

because during shutdown\_period, `costmap_ros_` may react rcl\_preshutdown earlier, so that planner/controller may try to access the `costmap_ros_` though it has been a nullptr.

### our provided solution

it seems that `costmap` is only used as a **child-thread** of planner/controller, [../nav2\_planner/src/planner\_server.cpp#L 89](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_planner/src/planner_server.cpp#L89)

so can we make it do nothing when reacting to Ctrl+C ?

doing so, its lifecycle would be completely bond to planner/controller's lifecycle, and also going to death in order.

```
//in file `costmap_2d_ros.hpp`
  /**
   * @brief override on_rcl_preshutdown() as empty
   * [reason] costmap only could be created by its parents like planner/controller_server
   * [reason] costmap may react to ctrl+C earlier than its parents to cause nullptr-accessed
   * so the costmap's reaction must be later than its parent to avoid nullptr-accessed
   *
   * thus, it's a more perfect way to override on_rcl_preshutdown() as empty function
   * and its deactivate must be joint in planner/controller_server->on_deactivate()
   * and its cleanup must be joint in planner/controller_server->on_cleanup()
   *
   * !!! a mention !!!
   * if any other place use this class (Costmap2DROS)
   * it's necessary to let costmap->deactivate() joint in parent->deactivate()
   * and let costmap->cleanup() joint in parent->cleanup()
   */
  void on_rcl_preshutdown() override{
    //do nothing
    return ;
  }
```

because the `costmp_ros_` is **just a thread** created by planner/controller,

whether program shutdown correctly or not, or even dead unexpectably, the **child-thread** could be closed all the time since **parent-LifecycleNode** sub-process dead.

Thus there's no need to worry whether it would be still alive after whole program exit finally.

### in addition

if our solution being adopted, many checks could be removed :

* [double check in planner\_server->on\_deactivate()](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_planner/src/planner_server.cpp#L221)
* [double check in planner\_server->on\_cleanup()](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_planner/src/planner_server.cpp#L254)
* [double check in controller\_server->on\_deactivate()](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_planner/src/planner_server.cpp#L285)
* [double check in controller\_server->on\_cleanup()](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_controller/src/controller_server.cpp#L315)

these double checks are also designed to face to bugs in situation that `costmap_ros_` may be closed earlier than planner/controller. After our code modification, these checks are useless anymore.

what's more, our solution performs perfectly during our local tests, much more than our past solutions mentioned in [#3958](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/pull/3958)

| We specially name nodes like `costmap_ros_` as **child-LifecycleNode**, which is born from their **parent-LifecycleNode** like `planner_server` and `controller_server`.  **our suggestion is:** Could we set up a mechanism specially for such situations like **child-LifecycleNode**, to make sure they're completely controlled by their parent?  these **child-LifecycleNode** should have some basic specialist like:   * they must be created by a **parent-LifecycleNode** * they must be created as a **thread** but **not a sub-process**   such mechanism could be like:   * `child's->activate` should be joint into its their parent's `on_configure` * `child->deactivate()` **must** be joint into its parent's `on_deactivate` * `child->cleanup()` **must** be joint into its parent's `on_cleanup` * and so on   Perhaps such mechanism could be used for any program in ROS2 ? |

| At present, the unit test of CI takes nav2\_ costmap\_2d is considered as an **independent LifecycleNode** for launch and shutdown tests, which goes **against the premise** of our proposed modification proposal  these child-LifecycleNode should have some basic specialist like: -- they must be created by a parent-LifecycleNode -- they must be created as a thread but not a sub-process  For this, we have three suggestions to address different development needs that may exist in the future. 1. modify the unit-test If it can be guaranteed that in current nav2 program usage and subsequent development, `nav2_costmap` will only be used as a **child-LifecycleNode**, the next step should be to modify the unit test.  It's only in need to modify the `launch` method of `costmap` based on the original unit test. Declare and launch a virtual **parent-LifecycleNode**, through which to run and preshutdown `costmap` in tests (just like how planner/controller do it) 2: create a new class `ChildCostmap2DROS` for NAV2 if you're worried that `Costmap2DROS` may be used as an individual LifecycleNode in future work, our suggestion is to create a new class named as `ChildCostmap2DROS`, specifically to implement the special usage of **child-LifecycleNode** by planner/controller.  It's only in need to create some new files like `child_costmap_2d_ros.hpp` similar to `costmap_2d_ros.hpp`, and `child_*.cpp` simliar to `*.cpp`  and change declaration of `global_costmap_` and `local_costmap_` in `planner/controller_server.cpp` 3. create a new class `ChildLifecycleNode` for ROS2 In other ROS2 programs, there may be something else, just like `costmap`, utilizes the characteristics of LifecycleNode for performance optimization, but is only used as a sub-thread? if such utilize method is widely used by various ROS2 programs, our suggestion is to create a new class named as ``ChildLifecycleNode` for whole ROS2, to optimize the shutdown mechanism of all **child-LifecycleNode**s and **parent-LifecycleNode**s, for thread management optimization.  by the way, such class `ChildLifecycleNode` must comply with the following mandatory requirements when used:   1. The 'activate', 'deactivate', and 'cleanup' of this class must be called by a **parent-LifecycleNode** 2. This class **must be** executed at the **thread** level and **not** be executed at the **process** level |

However, perhaps it may be still worried that any future changes may make these checks work again.  anyway, whether remove or retain them, I am very willing to make modifications based on your futher suggestions (●'◡'●) |

|  |  | \* @brief as a child-LifecycleNode : |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \* sometimes costmap may be launched by another LifecycleNode and work as a child-thread |
|  |  | \* child-LifecycleNodes should wait for their parents to handle the shutdown, which includes this module |
|  |  | \* Thus, it's neccessary to set NodeOption is\_lifecycle\_follower\_ as true |

* Fix undefined symbols in `libpf_lib.so` (#4312)

When I build `nav2_amcl` with `-Wl,--no-undefined` I noticed
`libpf_lib.so` has undefined symbols. This PR correctly links
`libpf_lib.so` to `libm` so all symbols can be found.

You can verify this by executing the following command:
```
ldd -r ./build/nav2_amcl/src/pf/libpf_lib.so
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd1f8c0000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x000074e909a00000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000074e909e60000)
undefined symbol: ceil	(./build/nav2_amcl/src/pf/libpf_lib.so)
undefined symbol: atan2	(./build/nav2_amcl/src/pf/libpf_lib.so)

* [RotationShimController] Rotate to goal heading (#4332)

When arriving in the goal xy tolerance, the rotation shim controller
takes back the control to command the robot to rotate in the goal
heading orientation.

The initial goal of the rotationShimController was to rotate the robot
at the beginning of a navigation towards the paths orientation because
some controllers are not good at performing in place rotations. For the
same reason, the rotationShimController should be able to rotate the
robot towards the goal heading.

When I build `nav2_amcl` with `-Wl,--no-undefined` I noticed
`libpf_lib.so` has undefined symbols. This PR correctly links
`libpf_lib.so` to `libm` so all symbols can be found.

You can verify this by executing the following command:

* [RotationShimController] Rotate to goal heading (#4332)

When arriving in the goal xy tolerance, the rotation shim controller
takes back the control to command the robot to rotate in the goal
heading orientation.

The initial goal of the rotationShimController was to rotate the robot
at the beginning of a navigation towards the paths orientation because
some controllers are not good at performing in place rotations. For the
same reason, the rotationShimController should be able to rotate the
robot towards the goal heading.

* Fix undefined symbols in `libpf_lib.so` ([ros-navigation#4312](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/pull/4312))

When I build `nav2_amcl` with `-Wl,--no-undefined` I noticed
`libpf_lib.so` has undefined symbols. This PR correctly links
`libpf_lib.so` to `libm` so all symbols can be found.

You can verify this by executing the following command:
```
ldd -r ./build/nav2_amcl/src/pf/libpf_lib.so
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd1f8c0000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x000074e909a00000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000074e909e60000)
undefined symbol: ceil	(./build/nav2_amcl/src/pf/libpf_lib.so)

* [RotationShimController] Rotate to goal heading ([ros-navigation#4332](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/pull/4332))

When arriving in the goal xy tolerance, the rotation shim controller
takes back the control to command the robot to rotate in the goal
heading orientation.

The initial goal of the rotationShimController was to rotate the robot
at the beginning of a navigation towards the paths orientation because
some controllers are not good at performing in place rotations. For the
same reason, the rotationShimController should be able to rotate the
robot towards the goal heading.
