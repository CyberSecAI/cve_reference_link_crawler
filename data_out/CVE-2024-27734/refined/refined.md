Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Site Name" field within the Site Settings. Specifically, it does not properly encode or filter HTML and Javascript code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization on the "Site Name" field
    *   The application allows the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*  **Attack Vectors**:
    *   The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code and inputs it into the Site Name field within Site Settings.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   This could result in various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive information (cookies, session data, etc), defacement of the website, redirecting to malicious websites, and more.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the admin settings of the CMS to modify the Site Name field.
*  **Additional Details:**
    *   The provided proof of concept (PoC) `<div><p title="</div><svg/onload=alert(1)>">` demonstrates the vulnerability. This injects an SVG element with an `onload` event handler to trigger an alert box to prove the XSS.
