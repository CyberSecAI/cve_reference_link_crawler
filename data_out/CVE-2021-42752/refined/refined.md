- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**:  Through a web page via `cgi_bin` handlers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a user to interact with a crafted link/web page (UI:R) and a low privilege account (PR:L). The attacker needs to convince the user to click on a link to trigger the attack.
