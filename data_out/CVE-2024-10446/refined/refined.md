Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10446

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "c" parameter of a multipart form, which allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists within the `/timetable/admin/admindashboard.php?info=add_course` endpoint of the application.
- The `MULTIPART c` parameter is vulnerable when adding a new department as an admin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database. It can potentially lead to complete compromise of the web application, including accessing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and personal data.
- The attacker might gain the ability to escalate privileges or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the application.
- The attack vector is through a multipart form submitted when adding a department through the admin interface.
- The attacker must be able to access the admin functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the web application, typically via a browser or a tool like Burp Suite.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin to reach the vulnerable functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept the request to manipulate the vulnerable parameter.
