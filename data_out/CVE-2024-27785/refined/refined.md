- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection [CWE-1236].
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on a client's workstation by using a malicious CSV report.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker exports a device inventory report in CSV format. This CSV file contains malicious formulas. When a user opens the CSV file with spreadsheet software, the formulas are executed, leading to arbitrary command execution on the user's workstation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with the ability to export the device inventory in a CSV format. The user must also open the malicious CSV file.
