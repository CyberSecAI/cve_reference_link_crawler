## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Tickera < 3.5.2.5 - Ticket leakage through IDOR

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users from leaking other users' tickets.

### Proof of Concept

After a user has bought a ticket, an example of a ticket would look like
https://www.website.com/?download\_ticket=1&order\_key=1234567890&download\_ticket\_nonce=ab903b7c71, but due to missing validation, the URL can be shortened to https://www.website.com/?download\_ticket=1&order\_key=1234567890.
This allows an attacker to take the ID value from another purchase in the download\_ticket parameter and iterate through the order\_key parameter from 00000000 to 99999999 and steal tickets from other participants
