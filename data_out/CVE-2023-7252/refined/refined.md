- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Tickera plugin fails to properly validate user access to tickets, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin uses predictable order IDs in the download ticket URLs, and doesn't validate if the user has access to the ticket.
    - **Missing Access Control:** The plugin does not enforce proper access control to prevent users from accessing other users' tickets.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Ticket leakage/theft:** Attackers can steal tickets from other users by iterating through order IDs in the download ticket URL.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Direct URL manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the `order_key` parameter in the download ticket URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to know the structure of the download URL with the `download_ticket` and `order_key` parameters.
    - No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
