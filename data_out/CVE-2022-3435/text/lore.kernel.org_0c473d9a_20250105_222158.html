Gwangun Jung reported a slab-out-of-bounds access in fib_nh_match:
    fib_nh_match+0xf98/0x1130 linux-6.0-rc7/net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c:961
    fib_table_delete+0x5f3/0xa40 linux-6.0-rc7/net/ipv4/fib_trie.c:1753
    inet_rtm_delroute+0x2b3/0x380 linux-6.0-rc7/net/ipv4/fib_frontend.c:874

Separate nexthop objects are mutually exclusive with the legacy
multipath spec. Fix fib_nh_match to return if the config for the
to be deleted route contains a multipath spec while the fib_info
is using a nexthop object.

Cool bug... Managed to reproduce with:

 # ip nexthop add id 1 blackhole
 # ip route add 192.0.2.0/24 nhid 1
 # ip route del 192.0.2.0/24 nexthop via 198.51.100.1 nexthop via 198.51.100.2

Maybe add to tools/testing/selftests/net/fib_nexthops.sh ?

Checked IPv6 and I don't think we can hit it there, but I will double
check tomorrow morning.

There is already such a check above for the non-multipath check, maybe
we can just move it up to cover both cases? Something like:

that's what I did as well.

I have one in my tree, but in my tests nothing blew up or threw an error
message. It requires KASAN to be enabled otherwise the test does not
trigger anything.

that should work as well. I went with the simplest change that would
definitely not have a negative impact on backports.

That's fine. At least our team is running this test as part of
regression on a variety of machines, some of which run a debug kernel
with KASAN enabled. The system knows to fail a test if a splat was
emitted to the kernel log.

Ha, I see this hunk was added by 6bf92d70e690b. Given how overzealous
the AUTOSEL bot is, I don't expect this fix to be missing from stable
kernels. If you also blame 6bf92d70e690b (given it was apparently
incomplete), then it makes it clear to anyone doing the backport that
6bf92d70e690b is needed as well.

I prefer having the check at the beginning because a) It would have
avoided this bug b) It directly follows the 'cfg->fc_nh_id' check,
making it clear that we never match if nexthop ID was not specified, but
we got a FIB info with a nexthop object.

I also think this other option is better, and I think the backport
effort will be mostly unaffected: a kernel needing 6bf92d70e690b but
not the above fix would be quite a strange/completely unexpected
subject for stable backport.

Could you please consider a v2 moving the check upwards?

Thanks!
