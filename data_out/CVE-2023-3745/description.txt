A heap-based buffer overflow issue was found in ImageMagick's PushCharPixel() function in quantum-private.h. This issue may allow a local attacker to trick the user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds read error and allowing an application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
