The provided content is a GitHub repository page that contains files related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Xintongda OA. The files include a PDF document (likely a report) and a video demonstrating the exploit. However, the content does not provide specific details about the vulnerability itself, such as the vulnerable code, attack vector, or impact of the exploit.
