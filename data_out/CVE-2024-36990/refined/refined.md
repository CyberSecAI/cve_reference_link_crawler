Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a cyclic dependency within a data model definition. This cyclic dependency can lead to an infinite loop during processing of a specially crafted HTTP POST request sent to the `/datamodel/web` REST endpoint. The infinite loop causes a stack overflow, resulting in the crash of the Splunk daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The core vulnerability is an infinite loop triggered by a cyclic dependency in data model definitions.
- **Stack Overflow:** The infinite loop leads to a stack overflow, which crashes the Splunk daemon.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability indicates a lack of proper validation or handling of data model definitions, allowing cyclic dependencies to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The crash of the Splunk daemon disrupts the availability of the Splunk service, rendering it unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/datamodel/web` REST endpoint.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be an authenticated user.
- **Low Privileges Sufficient:** The attacker doesn't require admin or power user roles, meaning even users with low privileges can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the vulnerable Splunk instance.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Splunk instance's `/datamodel/web` endpoint.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerability and how to craft the malicious request with cyclic dependency in data model definition.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, as well as Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.2.2403.100
- Splunk has released updated versions to address this vulnerability
- The provided detection identifies the issue by monitoring logs for specific error messages related to the shutdown of Splunk's HTTP server.
