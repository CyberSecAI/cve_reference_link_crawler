# Detection: Splunk DoS via POST Request Datamodel Endpoint

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 45766810-dbb2-44d4-b889-b4ba3ee0d1f5
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following is a hunting search that allows investigation of error messages indicating Splunk HTTP engine shutdown as a result of a crafted posted request against '/datamodel/model' endpoint.

### Search

```
1`splunkd_webs` log_level=INFO message="ENGINE: HTTP Server cherrypy._cpwsgi_server.CPWSGIServer(('127.0.0.1', 8065)) shut down"
2| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by splunk_server message
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_dos_via_post_request_datamodel_endpoint_filter`

```
### Data Source

No data sources specified for this detection.

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_dos\_via\_post\_request\_datamodel\_endpoint\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_dos_via_post_request_datamodel_endpoint_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Need access to the internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and will produce false positives as other causes can also shut down splunk HTTP engine, however this denial of service error is associated to a request to the datamodel/model endpoing which operator can research and find proximity of request and message in logs.

### Associated Analytic Story

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible Denial of Service attack against $splunk\_server$ | 50 | 100 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
