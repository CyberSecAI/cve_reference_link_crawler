# Denial of Service (DoS) on the datamodel/web REST endpoint

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-0710

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-36990](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36990)

**Published:** 2024-07-01

**Last Update:** 2024-07-01

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 6.5, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**CWE:** [CWE-835](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-15235

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.2.2403.100, an authenticated, low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles could send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the datamodel/web REST endpoint in Splunk Enterprise, potentially causing a denial of service.

The DoS could result from a condition where a data model definition contains a cyclic dependency. That dependency could lead to an infinite loop, which leads to a stack overflow and the subsequent crash of the Splunk daemon.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.
