- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `lnm` parameter in the `header.php` resource does not validate or sanitize user-provided input. This input is directly included in an SQL query without filtering.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLi). Specifically, the lack of input sanitization on the `lnm` parameter when inserting data into the `user_reg` table.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of data, or complete takeover of the database server. The CVSSv3 score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the `lnm` parameter within the `header.php` resource via HTTP POST request. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable resource.
