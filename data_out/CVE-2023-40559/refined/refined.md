*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user (e.g., through a crafted link or website), would cause the user's browser to perform unintended actions on the vulnerable website.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests and trick an authenticated user into triggering them.
