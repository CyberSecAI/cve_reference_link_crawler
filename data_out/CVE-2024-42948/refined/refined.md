- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromPptpUserSetting` function of Tenda FH1201 Firmware V1.2.0.14(408) due to the insecure use of `sprintf`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - The `fromPptpUserSetting` function takes user-controlled input via the `delno` parameter from a POST request.
    - The `sprintf` function is used to format the string without proper bounds checking: `sprintf(v9, "vpn.ser.pptpuser%s", s);`. The size of `v9` is insufficient, leading to a buffer overflow if the user-provided input `s` (derived from `delno`) is too large.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A successful exploit could lead to a stack overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device, leading to complete control of the router, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/PPTPUserSetting` endpoint. The request must contain the `delno` parameter with a string exceeding the buffer size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the Tenda FH1201 router's web interface.
