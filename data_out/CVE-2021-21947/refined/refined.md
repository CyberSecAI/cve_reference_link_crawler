**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE IDs:** CVE-2021-21947, CVE-2021-21946
*   **Affected Software:** Accusoft ImageGear 19.10
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Heap-based buffer overflow
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `process_jpeg_lossless` function, which parses JPEG data when a `SOF3` segment is present (lossless JPEG). The size calculation for component buffers during lossless Huffman code parsing is flawed. Specifically, there is a lack of boundary checks when writing to these component buffers, leading to overflows when specific conditions are met in crafted JPEG files.
*   **Weakness:** Missing boundary checks during buffer writes in the `process_jpeg_lossless` function when dealing with Huffman coded components. The buffer offset is calculated and used to write short or byte data into the buffer, without considering if the offset exceeds buffer limits.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted JPEG file to a vulnerable application using the affected library.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious JPEG file to an application using the vulnerable library. No other specific capabilities are required.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to a heap-based buffer overflow which can potentially allow an attacker to overwrite heap metadata, control execution flow, or trigger other memory corruption issues. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other malicious impacts.
*   **Vulnerability Explanation:**
    *   The `process_jpeg_lossless` function parses JPEG data when a `SOF3` segment is present, parsing the components specified in the `SOS` segment.
    *   Component buffer sizes are calculated in `allocate_buffer_for_jpeg_decoding`.
    *   The size of the buffer is based on subsampling factors, image dimensions, and a maximum subsampling factor for all components.
    *   Within `process_jpeg_lossless`, component buffers are accessed using an offset and an index. The offset is calculated based on loop variables without validating if it exceeds buffer boundaries.
    *   When the `SOF3`'s precision is lower than 9, a byte or short value is written at a specific position in the buffer, without checking if the calculated position is valid. If the position exceeds the size of the buffer, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs (CVE-2021-21946).
    *   A similar vulnerability exists when the SOF3's precision is greater than or equal to 9 (CVE-2021-21947).

**Summary:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of boundary checks when writing data into component buffers during lossless JPEG parsing. This is due to an incorrect calculation of the write position which uses offsets that are not validated against allocated buffer sizes. By crafting a malicious JPEG file with specific image parameters and component information, an attacker can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
