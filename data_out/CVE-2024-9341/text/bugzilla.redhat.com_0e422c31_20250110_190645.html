This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host system. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-09-30 15:47:51 UTC  ``` A flaw in the containers/common Go library, used by container runtimes such as Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O, allows a malicious container image to exploit the FIPS mode to bind mount arbitrary host directories into the container. The flaw arises from the MountsWithUIDGID() function, which attempts to mount a FIPS-related directory inside the container but does not properly verify the path. If the FIPS path is a symlink, it could point to arbitrary directories on the host, allowing an attacker to access sensitive host files.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-14 01:59:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:8039 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8039](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8039)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-15 09:28:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:8112 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8112](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8112)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-15 18:58:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17  Via RHSA-2024:7925 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7925](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A7925)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-23 13:30:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14  Via RHSA-2024:8238 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8238](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8238)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-24 10:59:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16  Via RHSA-2024:8263 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8263](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8263)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-31 03:56:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15  Via RHSA-2024:8428 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8428](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8428)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-05 03:54:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:8846 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8846](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8846)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-06 14:48:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13  Via RHSA-2024:8690 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8690](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8690)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-07 03:29:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12   Ironic content for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12  Via RHSA-2024:8694 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8694](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8694)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-12 11:12:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9454 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9454](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9454)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-12 11:13:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9459 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9459](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9459)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-26 18:45:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16  Via RHSA-2024:10147 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10147](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10147)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2315691#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-12-11 01:09:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17  Via RHSA-2024:10818 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10818](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10818)   ``` |  |
