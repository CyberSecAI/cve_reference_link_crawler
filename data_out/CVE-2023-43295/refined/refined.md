- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists due to a failure to properly validate the CSRF token, which allowed remote attackers to bypass CSRF protection by tricking a user into retrying a request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, insufficient CSRF token validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers, by tricking a user into retrying a request, could bypass CSRF protection and replay a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors**: By tricking an authenticated user into retrying a request with a crafted request, which could be achieved by embedding the malicious request in a webpage or by other social engineering techniques.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into retrying a request, and also be able to craft the malicious request that will be replayed, thus bypassing CSRF protection.
