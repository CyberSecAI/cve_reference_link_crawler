# OWASP dep-scan

# Introduction

OWASP dep-scan is a next-generation security and risk audit tool based on known vulnerabilities, advisories, and license limitations for project dependencies. Both local repositories and container images are supported as the input, and the tool is ideal for integration with ASPM/VM platforms and in CI environments.

![Depscan logo](/www-project-dep-scan/dep-scan.png)

## Features

* Scan most application code - local repos, Linux container images, Kubernetes manifests, and OS - to identify known CVEs with prioritization
* Perform advanced reachability analysis for multiple languages (See reachability analysis)
* Package vulnerability scanning is performed locally and is quite fast. No server is used!
* Generate Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) with Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR) information
* Generate a Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0 VEX document (check out the [CSAF Readme](https://github.com/owasp-dep-scan/dep-scan/blob/master/contrib/CSAF_README.md))
* Perform deep packages risk audit for dependency confusion attacks and maintenance risks (See risk audit)

### Vulnerability Data sources

* OSV
* NVD
* GitHub
* NPM
* Linux [vuln-list](https://github.com/appthreat/vuln-list) (Use `--cache-os`)

### Linux distros

* AlmaLinux
* Debian
* Alpine
* Amazon Linux
* Arch Linux
* RHEL/CentOS
* Rocky Linux
* Ubuntu
* OpenSUSE/SLES
* Photon
* Chainguard
* Wolfi OS

Application vulnerabilities would be reported for all Linux distros and Windows. To download the full vulnerability database suitable for scanning OS, invoke dep-scan with `--cache-os` for the first time. dep-scan would also download the appropriate database based on project type automatically.

## Usage

dep-scan is ideal for use during continuous integration (CI) and as a local development tool.

### OCI Artifacts via ORAS cli

Use [ORAS cli](https://oras.land/docs/installation/) to download the dep-scan binary and the vulnerability database for effortless integration. Example workflow is [here](https://github.com/appthreat/images-info/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml#L13).

```
export VDB_HOME=depscan
mkdir -p $VDB_HOME
oras pull ghcr.io/appthreat/vdb:v5 -o $VDB_HOME
oras pull ghcr.io/appthreat/depscan:v4 -o $VDB_HOME

```
### Single binary executables

Download the executable binary for your operating system from the [releases page](https://github.com/appthreat/depscan-bin/releases). These binary bundle the following:

* dep-scan with Python 3.10
* cdxgen with Node.js 18
* cdxgen binary plugins

```
curl -LO https://github.com/appthreat/depscan-bin/releases/latest/download/depscan-linux-amd64
chmod +x depscan-linux-amd64
./depscan-linux-amd64 --help

```

On Windows,

```
curl -LO https://github.com/appthreat/depscan-bin/releases/latest/download/depscan.exe
.\depscan.exe --help

```
### Server mode

dep-scan and cdxgen could be run in server mode. Use the included docker compose file to get started.

```
git clone https://github.com/owasp-dep-scan/dep-scan
docker compose up

```

```
depscan --server --server-host 0.0.0.0 --server-port 7070

```

In server mode, use `/cache` endpoint to cache the vulnerability database.

```
# This would take over 5 minutes
curl http://0.0.0.0:7070/cache

```

Use the `/scan` endpoint to perform scans.

> [!NOTE]
> The `type` parameter is mandatory in server mode.

* Scanning a local directory.
  ```
  curl --json '{"path": "/tmp/vulnerable-aws-koa-app", "type": "js"}' http://0.0.0.0:7070/scan

  ```
* Scanning an SBOM file (present locally).
  ```
  curl --json '{"path": "/tmp/vulnerable-aws-koa-app/sbom_file.json", "type": "js"}' http://0.0.0.0:7070/scan

  ```
* Scanning a GitHub repo.
  ```
  curl --json '{"url": "https://github.com/HooliCorp/vulnerable-aws-koa-app", "type": "js"}' http://0.0.0.0:7070/scan -o app.vdr.json

  ```
* Uploading an SBOM file and generating results based on it.
  ```
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -F 'file=@/tmp/app/sbom_file.json' http://0.0.0.0:7070/scan?type=js

  ```

### Scanning projects locally (Python version)

```
sudo npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen
pip install owasp-depscan

```

This would install two commands called `cdxgen` and `depscan`.

You can invoke the scan command directly with the various options.

```
cd <project to scan>
depscan --src $PWD --reports-dir $PWD/reports

```

The full list of options is below:

```
usage: cli.py [-h] [--no-banner] [--cache] [--csaf] [--sync] [--profile {appsec,research,operational,threat-modeling,license-compliance,generic}] [--no-suggest] [--risk-audit] [--private-ns PRIVATE_NS] [-t PROJECT_TYPE] [--bom BOM] [-i SRC_DIR_IMAGE] [-o REPORT_FILE]

```
### Scanning containers locally (Python version)

Scan `latest` tag of the container `shiftleft/scan-slim`

```
depscan --cache --src shiftleft/scan-slim -o containertests/depscan-scan.json -t docker

```

Include `license` to the type to perform license audit.

```
depscan --cache --src shiftleft/scan-slim -o containertests/depscan-scan.json -t docker,license

```

You can also specify the image using the sha256 digest

```
depscan --src redmine@sha256:a5c5f8a64a0d9a436a0a6941bc3fb156be0c89996add834fe33b66ebeed2439e -o containertests/depscan-redmine.json -t docker

```

You can also save container images using docker or podman save command and pass the archive to depscan for scanning.

```
docker save -o /tmp/scanslim.tar shiftleft/scan-slim:latest
# podman save --format oci-archive -o /tmp/scanslim.tar shiftleft/scan-slim:latest
depscan --src /tmp/scanslim.tar -o reports/depscan-scan.json -t docker

```

Refer to the docker tests under GitHub action workflow for this repo for more examples.

### Scanning projects locally (Docker container)

`ghcr.io/appthreat/dep-scan` or `public.ecr.aws/appthreat/dep-scan:latest` container image can be used to perform the scan.

To scan with default settings

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/app ghcr.io/appthreat/dep-scan --src /app --reports-dir /app/reports

```

Using AWS public ECR image

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/app public.ecr.aws/appthreat/dep-scan --src /app --reports-dir /app/reports

```

To scan with custom environment variables based configuration

```
docker run --rm \
    -e VDB_HOME=/db \
    -e NVD_START_YEAR=2010 \
    -e GITHUB_PAGE_COUNT=5 \
    -e GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> \
    -v /tmp:/db \
    -v $PWD:/app ghcr.io/appthreat/dep-scan --src /app --reports-dir /app/reports

```

In the above example, `/tmp` is mounted as `/db` into the container. This directory is then specified as `VDB_HOME` for caching the vulnerability information. This way the database can be cached and reused to improve performance.

## Supported languages and package format

dep-scan uses [cdxgen](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen) command internally to create Software Bill-of-Materials (SBoM) file for the project. This is then used for performing the scans.

The following projects and package-dependency format is supported by cdxgen.

| Language | Package format |
| --- | --- |
| node.js | package-lock.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, rush.js, bower.json, .min.js |
| java | maven (pom.xml [1]), gradle (build.gradle, .kts), scala (sbt), bazel |
| php | composer.lock |
| python | setup.py, requirements.txt [2], Pipfile.lock, poetry.lock, bdist\_wheel, .whl, .egg-info |
| go | binary, go.mod, go.sum, Gopkg.lock |
| ruby | Gemfile.lock, gemspec |
| rust | binary, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock |
| .Net | .csproj, packages.config, project.assets.json [3], packages.lock.json, .nupkg |
| dart | pubspec.lock, pubspec.yaml |
| haskell | cabal.project.freeze |
| elixir | mix.lock |
| c/c++ | conan.lock, conanfile.txt |
| clojure | Clojure CLI (deps.edn), Leiningen (project.clj) |
| docker / oci image | All supported languages and Linux OS packages |
| GitHub Actions Workflows | .github/workflows/\*.yml |
| Jenkins Plugins | .hpi files |
| YAML manifests | docker-compose, kubernetes, kustomization, skaffold, tekton etc |

**NOTE**

The docker image for dep-scan currently doesn’t bundle suitable java and maven commands required for bom generation. To workaround this limitation, you can -

1. Use python-based execution from a VM containing the correct versions for java, maven and gradle.
2. Generate the bom file by invoking `cdxgen` command locally and subsequently passing this to `dep-scan` via the `--bom` argument.

## Reachability analysis

Depscan can perform reachability analysis for Java, JavaScript, TypeScript and Python with built-in support for parsing [atom](https://github.com/AppThreat/atom) reachables slicing. Simply invoke depscan with the `research` profile and language type to enable this feature.

To receive a verbose output including the reachable flows, pass the argument `--explain`

```
--profile research -t language [--explain]

```
### Example analysis for a Java project

```
depscan --profile research -t java -i <source directory> --reports-dir <reports directory> --explain

```
### Example analysis for a JavaScript project

```
depscan --profile research -t js -i <source directory> --reports-dir <reports directory> --explain

```
## Customization through environment variables

The following environment variables can be used to customise the behaviour.

* VDB\_HOME - Directory to use for caching database. For docker based execution, this directory should get mounted as a volume from the host
* NVD\_START\_YEAR - Default: 2018. Supports upto 2002
* GITHUB\_PAGE\_COUNT - Default: 2. Supports upto 20

## GitHub Security Advisory

To download security advisories from GitHub, a personal access token with the following scope is necessary.

* read:packages

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<PAT token>"

```
## Suggest mode

Fix version for each vulnerability is retrieved from the sources. Sometimes, there might be known vulnerabilities in the fix version reported. Eg: in the below screenshot the fix versions suggested for jackson-databind might contain known vulnerabilities.

![Normal mode](/www-project-dep-scan/assets/images/depscan-normal.png)

By passing an argument `--suggest` it is possible to force depscan to recheck the fix suggestions. This way the suggestion becomes more optimal for a given package group.

![Suggest mode](/www-project-dep-scan/assets/images/depscan-suggest.png)

Notice, how the new suggested version is `2.9.10.5` which is an optimal fix version. Please note that the optimal fix version may not be the appropriate version for your application based on compatibility.

## Package Risk audit

`--risk-audit` argument enables package risk audit. Currently, only npm and pypi packages are supported in this mode. A number of risk factors are identified and assigned weights to compute a final risk score. Packages that then exceed a maximum risk score (`config.pkg_max_risk_score`) are presented in a table.

Use `--private-ns` to specify the private package namespace that should be checked for dependency confusion type issues where a private package is available on public npm/pypi registry.

For example, to check if private packages with namespaces @appthreat and @shiftleft are not accidentally made public, use the below argument.

```
--private-ns appthreat,shiftleft

```

| Risk category | Default Weight | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pkg\_private\_on\_public\_registry | 4 | Private package is available on a public registry |
| pkg\_min\_versions | 2 | Packages with less than 3 versions represent an extreme where they could be either super stable or quite recent. Special heuristics are applied to ignore older stable packages |
| mod\_create\_min\_seconds | 1 | Less than 12 hours difference between modified and creation time. This indicates that the upload had a defect that had to be rectified immediately. Sometimes, such a rapid update could also be malicious |
| latest\_now\_min\_seconds | 0.5 | Less than 12 hours difference between the latest version and the current time. Depending on the package such a latest version may or may not be desirable |
| latest\_now\_max\_seconds | 0.5 | Package versions that are over 6 years old are in use. Such packages might have vulnerable dependencies that are known or yet to be found |
| pkg\_min\_maintainers | 2 | Package has less than 2 maintainers. Many opensource projects have only 1 or 2 maintainers so special heuristics are used to ignore older stable packages |
| pkg\_min\_users | 0.25 | Package has less than 2 npm users |
| pkg\_install\_scripts | 2 | Package runs a custom pre or post installation scripts. This is often malicious and a downside of npm. |
| pkg\_node\_version | 0.5 | Package supports outdated version of node such as 0.8, 0.10, 4 or 6.x. Such projects might have prototype pollution or closure related vulnerabilities |
| pkg\_scope | 4 or 0.5 | Packages that are used directly in the application (required scope) gets a score with a weight of 4. Optional packages get a score of 0.25 |
| deprecated | 1 | Latest version is deprecated |

Refer to `pkg_query.py::get_category_score` method for the risk formula.

### Automatic adjustment

A parameter called `created_now_quarantine_seconds` is used to identify packages that are safely past the quarantine period (1 year). Certain risks such as `pkg_min_versions` and `pkg_min_maintainers` are suppressed for packages past the quarantine period. This adjustment helps reduce noise since it is unlikely that a malicious package can exist in a registry unnoticed for over a year.

### Configuring weights

All parameters can be customized by using environment variables. For eg:

export PKG\_MIN\_VERSIONS=4 to increase and set the minimum versions category to 4.

## Live OS scan

By passing `-t os`, depscan can generate an SBoM for a live operating system or a VM with OS packages and kernel information. Optionally, pass the argument `--deep` to generate an SBoM with both OS and application packages and to check for application vulnerabilities.

All OS packages.

```
depscan -t os -i . -o reports/depscan.json

```

All OS and application packages.

```
depscan -t os --deep -i . -o reports/depscan.json

```
## License scan

dep-scan can scan the dependencies for any license limitations and report them directly on the console log. To enable license scanning set the environment variable `FETCH_LICENSE` to `true`.

```
export FETCH_LICENSE=true

```

The license data is sourced from choosealicense.com and is quite limited. If the license of a given package cannot be reliably matched against this list it will get silently ignored to reduce any noise. This behavior could change in the future once the detection logic gets improved.

![License scan](/www-project-dep-scan/assets/images/license-scan.png)

## Kubernetes and Cloud apps

dep-scan could auto-detect most cloud applications and Kubernetes manifest files. Pass the argument `-t yaml-manifest` to manually specify the type.

## PDF reports

Ensure [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) is installed or use the official container image to generate pdf reports. Use with `--explain` for more detailed reports.

## Discord support

The developers could be reached via the [discord](https://discord.gg/DCNxzaeUpd) channel.

[Release v11.0.8 - Holiday update](/CycloneDX/cdxgen/releases/tag/v11.0.8)

We're ready to greet the new year with this holiday update. This release focuses on general improvements and tweaks to make cdxgen more useful for both users and AI bots. cdxgen can now reliably track all package manifests where a given component was found—especially helpful for vulnerability management and patching in large monorepos and multi-module projects. We’ve also improved dependency tree accuracy so bots like cdxgenGPT can better understand and reason about the underlying architecture.

Quality is a top priority. xBOM accuracy—particularly precision and recall—remains a constant topic that keeps us on our toes. Thanks to a generous sponsorship, we have added more snapshot testing for a number of languages and package manager ecosystems, and trained cdxgenGPT to serve as a good xBOM reviewer. We will soon use both automated testing and machine learning to continuously evaluate and improve BOM quality.

Please update to this version at your convenience. Happy Holidays!

[Release v11.0.5 - hey quarkus](/CycloneDX/cdxgen/releases/tag/v11.0.5)

cdxgen now supports the [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) framework with automatic detection for Maven projects—no configuration changes needed. It uses the official `dependency-sbom` goal but adds extra value by including phantom JARs that aren’t managed through Maven. With the research profile enabled (--profile research), cdxgen produces a highly detailed SBOM with occurrences and call stack evidence, offering better insights than the official implementation, which only tracks jar files.

[cdxgenGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-673bfeb4037481919be8a2cd1bf868d2-cyclonedx-generator-cdxgen) is also updated to better understand the evidence information for decent reasoning performance.

# [Security] Code execution risk when running cdxgen against untrusted repos #1328

## Description

![@prabhu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7842?u=98d46d8ada2d86fe8660557e67e75d7041281d46&v=4&size=48)[prabhu](https://github.com/prabhu)opened [on Aug 26, 2024](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen/issues/1328#issue-2487384917)

**This is a design limitation, without an immediate fix.**

## Summary

(Rewritten for clarity)

* Users of cdxgen are known to run the tool against both trusted and untrusted codebases
* cdxgen executes numerous external and package manager commands, including `npm install`, maven, gradle, and sbt commands
* Many package managers support custom scripts and plugins to execute additional commands.
  + For example, when cdxgen invokes `npm install` (default behavior unless `--no-install-deps` is passed), npm could be invoking more commands as per the scripts section in the package.json file present in the given codebase.

## POC

1. Generate a gradle project with gradle init (choose all defaults, this will generate a Kotlin based DSL)
2. Open build.gradle.kts
3. Add this to the end of the file, e.g.

```
val projectRoot = project.rootProject.projectDir

val file = file("$projectRoot/hello.txt")
file.writeText("hello world")
```

4. Run “cdxgen -o bom.json” without any other params
5. Result: the code above is being executed

## Timeline

8 Aug 2024 - Email received from the researcher.

8 Aug 2024 - Initial response: Known acceptable risk that is consistent with executing any CLI command including the package manager commands themselves.

19 Aug 2024 - Researcher shared more details about attacking SCA scanners that wrap cdxgen such as OWASP dep-scan.

26 Aug 2024 - GitHub Issue created.

## Known workarounds

* Run cdxgen using the container image with limited volume mounts, random TEMP directories (avoid `-v /tmp:/tmp` and `-v $HOME:$HOME`), and a dedicated [seccomp](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/) profiles.
* Use the argument `--no-install-deps` or `--lifecycle pre-build` to prevent cdxgen from running install commands. This may not work for all package managers.
* Do not run cdxgen against untrusted codebases and with sudo/administrative privileges.
* Use cdxgen with deno runtime.
