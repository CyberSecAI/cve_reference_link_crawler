# [Security] Code execution risk when running cdxgen against untrusted repos¬†#1328

## Description

![@prabhu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7842?u=98d46d8ada2d86fe8660557e67e75d7041281d46&v=4&size=48)[prabhu](https://github.com/prabhu)opened [on Aug 26, 2024](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen/issues/1328#issue-2487384917)

**This is a design limitation, without an immediate fix.**

## Summary

(Rewritten for clarity)

* Users of cdxgen are known to run the tool against both trusted and untrusted codebases
* cdxgen executes numerous external and package manager commands, including `npm install`, maven, gradle, and sbt commands
* Many package managers support custom scripts and plugins to execute additional commands.
  + For example, when cdxgen invokes `npm install` (default behavior unless `--no-install-deps` is passed), npm could be invoking more commands as per the scripts section in the package.json file present in the given codebase.

## POC

1. Generate a gradle project with gradle init (choose all defaults, this will generate a Kotlin based DSL)
2. Open build.gradle.kts
3. Add this to the end of the file, e.g.

```
val projectRoot = project.rootProject.projectDir

val file = file("$projectRoot/hello.txt")
file.writeText("hello world")
```

4. Run ‚Äúcdxgen -o bom.json‚Äù without any other params
5. Result: the code above is being executed

## Timeline

8 Aug 2024 - Email received from the researcher.

8 Aug 2024 - Initial response: Known acceptable risk that is consistent with executing any CLI command including the package manager commands themselves.

19 Aug 2024 - Researcher shared more details about attacking SCA scanners that wrap cdxgen such as OWASP dep-scan.

26 Aug 2024 - GitHub Issue created.

## Known workarounds

* Run cdxgen using the container image with limited volume mounts, random TEMP directories (avoid `-v /tmp:/tmp` and `-v $HOME:$HOME`), and a dedicated [seccomp](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/) profiles.
* Use the argument `--no-install-deps` or `--lifecycle pre-build` to prevent cdxgen from running install commands. This may not work for all package managers.
* Do not run cdxgen against untrusted codebases and with sudo/administrative privileges.
* Use cdxgen with deno runtime.
