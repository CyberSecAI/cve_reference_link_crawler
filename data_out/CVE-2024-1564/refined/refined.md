- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate post access permissions, allowing a contributor user to access custom fields of any post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control (CWE-284)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A contributor-level user can access and disclose custom field values of any post, regardless of the post type or status. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a shortcode with `aiosrs_pro_custom_field` and embedding it into a post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a WordPress user with at least contributor-level access.
