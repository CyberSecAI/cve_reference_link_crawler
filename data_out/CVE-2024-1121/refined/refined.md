Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check in the `export_json_file()` function (referenced as `export_page` in the provided code) within the Advanced Forms for ACF plugin. Specifically, the function responsible for exporting form settings as JSON did not verify if the user had the necessary permissions to perform this action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of an authorization check before exporting form settings. This allows any user, including unauthenticated ones, to trigger the export functionality.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the settings of forms based on a form id passed via GET parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to the configuration settings of forms created with the plugin. This could potentially include sensitive information or details about the form structure and functionality. The exported JSON file could reveal details about form fields, validation rules, and other internal settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific URL with a form ID and the `export_json` parameter. Because no authentication or authorization is required, the server will process the request and provide the exported form settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** An attacker does not need to have any user account on the vulnerable website to exploit the flaw.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 1.9.3.2.
- The fix involves adding a capability check and a nonce verification to the export function, which are present in version 1.9.3.3.
- The capability `edit_pages` is checked before proceeding with the export.
- A nonce is included in the export URL and verified before proceeding with the form export to prevent CSRF attacks.
