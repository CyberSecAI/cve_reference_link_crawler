Based on the provided text, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Affected Product:** J2EEFAST v2.7.0

**Fixed Version:** J2EEFAST v2.7.0 (Note: This seems contradictory; it's likely a patch or configuration change within v2.7.0 is needed, not an upgrade to a new version)

**Root Cause:**
- The `com.j2eefast.flowable.bpm.controller.ProcessController: com.j2eefast.common.core.utils.ResponseData myProcessList()` function in J2EEFAST does not properly sanitize or filter the `sql_filter` parameter.

**Weakness:**
- Lack of input validation/sanitization on the `sql_filter` parameter.
- Direct usage of unsanitized user-controlled data in SQL queries.

**Attack Vector:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `sql_filter` parameter, which is then passed to the `findPage` function in `ProcessInstanceMapper.xml`.

**Impact:**
- SQL Injection allows attackers to potentially:
    - Access sensitive data
    - Modify data
    - Execute arbitrary code on the database server
    - Potentially gain full control of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `myProcessList()` function and manipulate the `sql_filter` parameter. It is not explicitly stated if authentication is required to call this function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text also includes the vendor website, `https://www.j2eefast.com/`.
- The vulnerability is located in `com.j2eefast.flowable.bpm.controller.ProcessController`.
- The malicious SQL payload is used within the `findPage` function of `ProcessInstanceMapper.xml`.
