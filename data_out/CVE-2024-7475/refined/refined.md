Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in insufficient authorization checks within the backend API endpoints. Specifically, the commit addresses missing `project_id` checks in SQL queries. This allowed users to potentially access or manipulate resources belonging to other projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows a user to potentially access or modify data belonging to other projects by manipulating resource IDs, as the backend was not properly validating whether the user had access to the targeted `project_id`.
* **Authorization Bypass:** Lack of proper authorization checks meant that access to sensitive data and functionalities was not restricted based on the user's project membership.
* **SQL Injection (Potential):** While not explicitly mentioned, the use of string interpolation with user-provided inputs (e.g., IDs) in SQL queries without sufficient sanitization could lead to SQL injection. Although parameterized queries are used which mitigate this risk, the logic flaws in authorization increase the risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data from other projects.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data belonging to other projects without proper authorization.
* **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While the immediate impact is data access and manipulation, the lack of proper checks could potentially be exploited for privilege escalation if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **API Manipulation:** Attackers could directly manipulate API requests by changing IDs and other parameters to access resources outside of their project scope.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the API.
* The attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the vulnerable endpoints and manipulate the request parameters, specifically the resource IDs.

**Detailed Code Changes:**

*   **packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets/index.ts:**
    *   The patch adds `and project_id = ${projectId}` to the `update dataset` query, ensuring that only datasets belonging to the user's current project can be updated.
    *   The patch includes a check to ensure that the dataset belongs to the current project before updating dataset prompts.
*   **packages/backend/src/api/v1/external-users.ts:**
    *   The patch adds `and project_id = ${projectId}` to both the `select` and `delete` queries for `external_user`, preventing unauthorized access and deletion of external users from other projects.
*   **packages/backend/src/api/v1/templates.ts:**
    *   The patch adds a check to ensure that the template belongs to the user's current project before a new version can be created, preventing users from creating template versions on projects they do not belong to.

**Summary of Changes:**

The changes involve adding project ID checks to SQL queries used by API endpoints that handle datasets, external users, and templates. These checks ensure that operations are performed only on resources that belong to the project associated with the currently authenticated user, thus addressing the authorization vulnerabilities.

These changes address the vulnerabilities by ensuring that all queries involving resources like datasets, users and templates are tied to the currently logged in user's project, which wasn't being done before, and thus allowed for a user to manipulate another user's projects data.
