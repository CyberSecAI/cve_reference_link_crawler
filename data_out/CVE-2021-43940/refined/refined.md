- **Root cause of vulnerability:** DLL hijacking vulnerability in the Confluence installer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Confluence installer on Windows is susceptible to DLL hijacking. An attacker can place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated local attacker to achieve elevated privileges on the local system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have a local user account on the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the Windows system where the vulnerable Confluence installation is present.
