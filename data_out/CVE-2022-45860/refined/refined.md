- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Weak authentication mechanism on the device registration page. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to improper access control on the FortiNAC device registration page, allowing attackers to conduct password spraying attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-1390, weak authentication, improper access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can perform password spraying attacks with an increased chance of success. The attacker can gain unauthorized access, though the impact is rated as "Improper access control" with limited changes.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the device registration page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attacker, no special capabilities or access needed except access to the registration page.
