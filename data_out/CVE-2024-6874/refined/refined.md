Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in libcurl's URL API function `curl_url_get()` when performing punycode conversions with the `macidn` IDN backend.
- Specifically, when converting a name that is exactly 256 bytes, libcurl reads past the end of a stack-based buffer.
- The conversion function fills the destination buffer exactly without null-terminating the string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Over-read (CWE-126):**  Reading past the end of a stack buffer.
- **Missing null termination:** The converted string is not null-terminated, potentially leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information present on the stack could be disclosed as part of the converted string.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to provide a URL that results in a punycode conversion of exactly 256 bytes when using the `macidn` IDN backend.
- The `curl_url_get()` function must be called with a URL containing a domain name that will be processed by the `macidn` backend.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have some control over the input to libcurl, specifically the URL being processed.
- The attacker would need to target systems where curl is built using the `macidn` IDN backend (Apple OS).

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to libcurl, not the curl command-line tool.
*   The vulnerability exists in curl version 8.8.0. Versions before 8.8.0 and after (>= 8.9.0) are not affected.
*   NetApp products are under investigation. Some of them are potentially vulnerable, while many are confirmed to be not affected.
*   The issue was reported and patched by the same entity, z2_.
*   The vulnerability has a severity rating of "Low" by curl, but a "High" rating (7.5) by NetApp.
