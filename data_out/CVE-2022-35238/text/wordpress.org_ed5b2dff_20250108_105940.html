Well done, but why don’t make items open in a lightbox?

### [Not working at all](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-working-at-all-124/)

Only shows the shortcode on the page.
Error handling is hopeless.
When forgetting to set a thumbnail, the pages shows:
“Array ( [dirname] => /ya/dee.ya.da/duh/barf/uploads/2016/07 [basename] => 009\_Landscape\_001\_small.jpg [extension] => jpg [filename] => 009\_Landscape\_001\_small )
Why not use wordpress´ hooks functions to read the thumbnail.
It all seems a bit amateuristic.
