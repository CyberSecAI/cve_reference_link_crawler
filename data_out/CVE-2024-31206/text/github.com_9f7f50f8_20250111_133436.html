# Use of Unencrypted HTTP Request in dectalk-tts

## Package

npm

dectalk-tts
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a [man-in-the-middle (MITM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attack.

Theft

Because `dectalk-tts` is a text-to-speech package, user requests are expected to only contain natural language. The package [README](https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/blob/main/README.md) warns that user input is sent to a third-party API, so users should not send sensitive information regardless.

But if users ignore the warnings and send sensitive information anyway, that information could be stolen by attackers.

Modification

Attackers could manipulate requests to the API. However, the worst a modified request could do is return an incorrect audio file or bad request rejection.

Attackers could also manipulate responses from the API, returning malicious output to the user. Output is expected to be a wav-encoded buffer, which users will likely save to a file. This could be a dangerous entrypoint to the user's filesystem.

### Patches

The network request was upgraded to HTTPS in version `1.0.1`. No other changes were made, so updating is risk-free.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds, but here are some precautions:

* Do not send any sensitive information.
* Carefully verify the API response before saving it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
