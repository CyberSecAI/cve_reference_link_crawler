- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Non-constant-time comparison of hashes in the `analytics_dashboard` function within the Gradio library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Timing attack vulnerability due to the non-constant time hash comparison. This allows an attacker to infer the correct hash by observing the response time of requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard.
- **Attack vectors:** By measuring the response time of different requests with varying keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to repeatedly query the system with different keys. They do not need prior authentication other than the ability to send requests.
