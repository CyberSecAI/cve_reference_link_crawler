Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the GeoNode application's rich text editor. Specifically, the application was not properly sanitizing HTML input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript can be injected and stored in the application's database through the rich text editor. This script is then executed when other users view the content.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize user-provided HTML content, which allowed for the injection of `<script>` tags and other potentially malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can leverage the XSS vulnerability to steal a victim's CSRF token. With this token, the attacker can change the victim's email address and gain full control of their account.
- **Arbitrary Actions:** The attacker can perform other actions as the compromised user, potentially including data modification or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the rich text editor.
- The injected script executes when a user views the page containing the malicious code.
- The malicious script retrieves the victim's CSRF token.
- The attacker uses the CSRF token to change the victim's email address and hijack the account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user capable of posting content through the rich text editor.
- The attacker needs to identify an area where the rich text editor input is not sanitized and is rendered to other users.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in GeoNode versions prior to 4.2.3, and is resolved in version 4.2.3.
- The vulnerability was reported by "ImThatT"
- The fix involved implementing a `sanitize_html` template filter using the `nh3` library to remove dangerous HTML tags and JavaScript patterns before rendering HTML content. This template filter is then applied to various fields in `metadata_detail.html`, including `resource.abstract`, `keyword.name`, `resource.constraints_other`, `resource.purpose`, `resource.data_quality_statement`, and `resource.supplemental_information`.
