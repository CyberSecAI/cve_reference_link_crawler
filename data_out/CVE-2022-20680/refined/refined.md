Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-20680:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper enforcement of *Administrator* privilege levels when accessing low-value sensitive data in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Service Catalog.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Information Disclosure: The system fails to properly restrict access to sensitive data based on the principle of least privilege, allowing unauthorized users to view data they should not have access to.
- Insufficient Privilege Enforcement: The application does not differentiate between different levels of *Administrator* access (e.g., read-only vs. full access) when serving sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about users of the system and orders that have been placed using the application. This information can potentially be used for further attacks, identity theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is executed remotely over the network through the web-based management interface.
- The attacker sends a malicious HTTP request to the page containing the sensitive data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid read-only *Administrator* access to the web-based management interface. This implies that the attacker has been authenticated.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- No workarounds are available.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- A software update is available to address this vulnerability, specifically in Cisco Prime Service Catalog release 12.1 patch v18.
- The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
