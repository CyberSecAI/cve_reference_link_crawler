| <https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine>  The rce vulnerability is caused by the code reading the value from the yaml file and splicing it directly into the os.system statement.  [github permark](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/blob/67ca0a4350c4fb4b3d9a25c01db7024e170ff12a/web/reNgine/tasks.py#L1692-L1708)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34082644/179657556-794eba05-0ffc-4d8b-aa20-0875e48cc7da.png)  ==================== If you try to reproduce the vulnerability, add the command you want to execute in the scan engine template in the background, then create a target and select the scan engine template for scanning. After a while, you will find that the command is successfully executed.
