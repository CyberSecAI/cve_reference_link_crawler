  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to the use of unsanitized input to build a SQL query.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could modify the meaning of the SQL query or execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to potential data breaches or system manipulation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a GET request parameter named 'id'.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `expense.php` endpoint with a crafted 'id' parameter."
