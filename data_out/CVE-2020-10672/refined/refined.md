    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the mishandling of the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing within the `jackson-databind` library. Specifically, the issue involves the `org.apache.aries.transaction.jms.internal.XaPooledConnectionFactory` class, which is a serialization gadget.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Mishandling of serialization gadgets",
        "Insecure polymorphic type handling"

      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending malicious crafted JSON content to be deserialized by a vulnerable system."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send untrusted JSON content to a system that uses a vulnerable version of `jackson-databind` and has the vulnerable class in the classpath. The attacker may also need to control which subtypes are used during deserialization."
      ,"additional_notes" : "The vulnerability is present in FasterXML jackson-databind versions 2.x before 2.9.10.4. The vulnerability is related to the handling of polymorphic typing when deserializing JSON content. The specific gadget class involved is `org.apache.aries.transaction.jms.internal.XaPooledConnectionFactory`. The description notes that for the exploit to work, the system has to accept JSON content sent by an untrusted client, have the specific gadget class in the classpath, enable polymorphic type handling for properties with type Object or some other permissive tag interfaces, and have an unpatched version of Jackson. The provided content mentions that using class names for type IDs and enabling default typing can expose systems to such attacks.  The information also mentions that updates to jackson-databind include fixes that block specific gadget types, so updating jackson-databind is an important mitigation.
