{
  "CVE-2022-45061": {
    "root_cause": "An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inefficient algorithm",
       "Lack of input length validation"
    ],
    "impact": "CPU denial of service (DoS). A crafted, unreasonably long name presented to the IDNA decoder could lead to excessive CPU consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Passing a crafted host name to asyncio create_connection or similar functions that use the IDNA decoder.",
       "Placing the attack payload in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302.",
       "Libraries that allow an attacker controlled hostname without a reasonable length check on it to get into a connect or similar call that tries idna decoding"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker can control the input strings (hostnames) that will be processed by the IDNA decoder."
