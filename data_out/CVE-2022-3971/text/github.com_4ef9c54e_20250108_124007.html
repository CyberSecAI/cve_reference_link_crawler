### @jaller94 **[jaller94](/jaller94)** commented [Sep 26, 2022](#issue-1385695911)

Prevents low-risk SQL injection from roomId values when checking room visibility.

This fixes a hard to exploit SQL injection vector.

To abuse this, an attacker needs to be able to set malicious Matrix IDs in the room mappings.

Sorry, something went wrong.
