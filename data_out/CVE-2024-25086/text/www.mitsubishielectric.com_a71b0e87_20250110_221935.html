Multiple FA Engineering Software Products

Release date: May 14, 2024
Last  update  date:  October  31,2024
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation

Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities due to vulnerabilities in Jungo's WinDriver exist in multiple FA engineering software products. If a malicious
code is executed on a computer where the affected software product is installed, these vulnerabilities may allow a local attacker to
cause  a  Windows  blue  screen  (BSOD)  error  that  results  in  a  denial  of  service  (DoS)  condition  and/or  to  gain  Windows  system
privileges and execute arbitrary commands (CVE-2023-51776, CVE-2023-51777, CVE-2023-51778, CVE-2024-22102, CVE-2024-
22103,  CVE-2024-22104,  CVE-2024-22105,  CVE-2024-22106,  CVE-2024-25086,  CVE-2024-25087,  CVE-2024-25088,  CVE-
2024-26314). However, attacks against these vulnerabilities can be detected by Microsoft Windows Defender.
