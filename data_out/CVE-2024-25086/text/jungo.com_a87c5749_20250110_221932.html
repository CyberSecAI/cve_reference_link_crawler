### Enhancements

* Several transfer commands that acknowledge an interrupt/for interrupt acknowledgment can now be set in DriverWizard.
* Improvement of Debug Monitor buffer overflow behavior, so that older messages are lost rather than new messages.

### Fixes

* PCI — GeneralAccess to EEPROM of PLX 9030, 9054 and IOP480 chipsets was improved. Now when access to EEPROM of these chipsets fails, WinDriver retries the entire access process.Interrupt handling by DriverWizard was fixed. A bug since version 5.0 caused DriverWizard to handle interrupts without implementing all the parameters assigned by the user; this affected level sensitive interrupt handling and data transfer operation type definition.Execution method of interrupts transfer commands was improved. Now the interrupt transfer commands are executed only if the application handling the interrupts exits abnormally. A bug since version 4.4.0 caused interrupts transfer commands to be executed each time the interrupt was disabled.Fixed a bug that caused WinDriver to issue application assertion under Windows 2000 checked-build.FixedWD\_MultiTransfer()to support Delphi.DriverWizard was fixed to disable generation ofXXX\_AccessRanges(hXXX)functions when the relevant PCI device has no I/﻿O or memory resources at all. This bug caused compilation errors when trying to compile generated code for devices with no I/﻿O or memory resources.

* Fixed the support for interrupt handling on dual CPU platforms. Interrupt line and device resources information is now retrieved from the operating system (instead of directly from the hardware).

* Set Auto Masking for non-sharable interrupts only. A bug since v4.4.2 could have causedWD\_IntDisable(), when using sharable interrupts, to disable other interrupts as well.
* Linux — GeneralThe operation of the functionWD\_DMALock()for contiguous DMA under Linux was fixed. The bug caused the function to reserve one extra page (if the allocation was page aligned). This resulted in kernel panic insidekfree()(which was observed when the following sequence was performed: lock, lock, free, free).Modified user makefiles for compilation under RedHat Linux 7.0 and above.

* Windows — GeneralFixed a dependency problem betweenwindrvr.sysandwdpnp.sys. A bug since version 5.0.3 causedwindrvrto return error code 37 (STATUS\_INTERNAL\_ERROR) ifwdpnp.syswas loaded beforewindrvr.sys/vxd. Now, the resource management is handled bywdpnp.sysinstead ofwindrvr.sys/vxdand ifwindrvr.sys/vxdis loaded afterwdpnp.sys, it will initiate the transfer of the card resources instead ofwdpnp.sys.Moreover, nowwdpnp.sysdoes not assume thatwindrvr.sysis loaded and the two files open a communication path between them only to perform short operations, and then close it. This allows eliminating the dependency between the files and results in an improved stability and robustness.Fixed the methodwdpnp.sysretrieves the bus number of PCI devices. It now retrieves the bus number by directly inquiring the PCI devices, instead of inquiring the Windows operating system, since the operating system always returns 0.Fixed IDE to invoke combo box behavior on Windows platforms. The bug caused the default IDE to invoke to be “none”. Now IDE to invoke is with accordance to the IDE chosen by the user to generate project makefiles for; the default IDE to invoke is MS Visual C﻿+﻿+ 6.0.

* USBThe “send to pipe” operation in DriverWizard was fixed to allow input of long data strings (i.e., more than 1024 chars). The bug caused DriverWizard to issue application error when long data strings were sent.Timeout expiration was fixed to avoid BSOD if the USB device is no longer connected.WinDriver now uses the operating system’s DeviceAddress as a USB uniqueId instead of obtaining the Pointer to Device Object (PDO) from the operating system. Now WinDriver obtains the PDO only for the purpose of communicating with the USB device at theWD\_GetConfiguration()andWD\_DeviceRegister()stages. The reason is that obtaining the PDO is an intrusive operation, which could interfere with the operation of other devices drivers.For Isochronous data transfers, now WinDriver sends the last packet in a separate transaction, instead of the same transaction. The bug caused, in certain circumstances, the operating system USBD to send the last packet twice.
