Based on the provided information, this vulnerability is related to a traffic leak in the `mt7530` network driver of the Linux kernel, specifically when VLAN filtering is enabled and then disabled.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `PCR_MATRIX` field, which determines the ports that belong to a given VLAN, is set to all 1's (meaning all ports are part of the VLAN) when VLAN filtering is enabled. However, it is not reset to its default state when VLAN filtering is disabled. This leads to traffic leaks between different network bridges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of the `PCR_MATRIX` field when disabling VLAN filtering.
- The `mt7530_port_set_vlan_aware` function was incorrectly setting the `PCR_MATRIX`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Traffic can leak between different bridge network interfaces when VLAN filtering is disabled. This means packets intended for one bridge might be forwarded to another, causing unintended network behavior, potentially exposing data, and disrupting network segmentation.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by enabling and disabling VLAN filtering on bridge interfaces connected to the `mt7530` switch. The following sequence of commands can expose the vulnerability:
```
ip link add br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1
ip link add br1 type bridge vlan_filtering 1
ip link set swp0 master br0
ip link set swp1 master br1
ip link set br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 0
ip link set br1 type bridge vlan_filtering 0
```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to configure network interfaces, specifically bridges and VLAN filtering.
- The attacker must have access to a system using the affected `mt7530` switch driver.
- No special privileges beyond network configuration are required to trigger the bug.

**Additional Details**
The fix removes the writing of `PCR_MATRIX` from the `mt7530_port_set_vlan_aware` function because the `port_bridge_{add,del}` functions already handle the proper setup of the `PCR_MATRIX`.
