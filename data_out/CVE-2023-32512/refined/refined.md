- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ShortPixel Adaptive Images plugin for WordPress versions 3.7.1 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where an attacker crafts a malicious request that is then triggered by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a higher privileged user into executing the malicious request while the user is logged in to the WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
