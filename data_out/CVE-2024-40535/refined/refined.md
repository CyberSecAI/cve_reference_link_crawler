The provided content relates to CVE-2024-40535.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation and length restrictions on the `pin_3g_code` and `apn_name_3g` parameters within the `config_3g_para` function of the LBT-T300-T400 firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `config_3g_para` function due to the lack of input validation.
- Specifically, the `pin_3g_code` and `apn_name_3g` parameters are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can cause a buffer overflow by sending overly long inputs through the vulnerable parameters.
- This may lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/apply.cgi` endpoint with oversized `pin_3g_code` or `apn_name_3g` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the LBT-T300-T400 device.
- They must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device.
- The attacker may need to authenticate, in this case, the content shows basic authentication with user `admin` and password `admin`.
