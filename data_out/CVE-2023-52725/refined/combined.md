### @ty3gx **[ty3gx](/ty3gx)** commented [Aug 31, 2023](#issue-1876445950)

**Summary:**

This PR resolves an issue in the *Start* function of the *monitoring* package, specifically concerning how the *errCh* channel could become blocked. The PR also addresses an array index out-of-bounds issue in the *processIndicationFormat1* function.

**Issue Details:**

*\* Blocked errCh Channel*

In the original implementation, the *errCh* channel was used to handle errors generated by both the *m.streamReader.Recv(ctx)* and *m.processIndication(ctx, indMsg, m.measurements, m.nodeID)* methods. However, the channel can lead to a blocking issue:

To illustrate, when *m.processIndication* first produces an error, this error is consumed by the parent *Start* function. As a result, the *Start* function returns, eliminating the only consumer for the *errCh* channel. Consequently, when a second error is posted to *errCh*, the send operation gets indefinitely blocked. This blockage prevents the associated indication processing goroutine from processing subsequent indication messages.

*\* Array Index Out-of-Bounds in processIndicationFormat1*

The *processIndicationFormat1* function had the potential to cause a panic due to array index out-of-bounds. This happened when *measInfoList* was smaller in size than *meadDataRecords*. A simple check is added to prevent the panic.

Please let me know if these fixes are reasonable or if any further modifications are required.

Sorry, something went wrong.
