The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during the processing of these packets. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit it by sending a malformed CIP packet to cause an affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. There are no workarounds, and software updates are required to remediate it. The document also includes details on vulnerable products, how to determine if CIP is enabled, and where to obtain fixed software.",
