**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_d36988c3_20250108_153514.html` and `tools.cisco.com_064eac67_20250108_123814.html` explicitly mentions **CVE-2022-20847** and provides details about the vulnerability. This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the **improper processing of DHCP messages** within Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software.
*   **Weaknesses:** The software has a weakness in how it handles certain DHCP messages. Specifically, the improper processing of DHCP messages when the DHCP TLV caching feature is enabled.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a **denial-of-service (DoS)** condition. The device will reload, causing service disruption.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious DHCP messages to a vulnerable device over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic (malicious DHCP messages) to a target device. No authentication is required.

**3. Affected Products:**

The following products are affected if they are running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software and have the DHCP TLV caching feature enabled:

*   Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controllers for Cloud
*   Catalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controllers for Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches
*   Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers
*   Embedded Wireless Controllers on Catalyst Access Points

**4. Non-Affected Products:**

The vulnerability does not affect the following products:

*   IOS Software
*   IOS XR Software
*   Meraki products
*   NX-OS Software
*   Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) AireOS Software

**5. Additional Details:**

*   The DHCP TLV caching feature is **not enabled by default**.
*   There are **no workarounds** to mitigate this vulnerability other than applying the software fixes.
*   Cisco has released free software updates to address the issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public exploitation or announcements regarding the vulnerability before their advisory release.

**6. CVSS Score:**

The CVSS v3.1 base score is **8.6 (High)** with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H`.

**7. Remediation:**

Customers are advised to upgrade to the fixed software releases. A link to Cisco's Software Checker is provided to assist in determining the software version required to fix the vulnerability.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

This vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software arises from the improper processing of DHCP messages when the DHCP TLV caching feature is enabled. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send malicious DHCP messages to trigger a device reload, causing a DoS. The vulnerability is rated as High severity (8.6 CVSS) and requires a software update for remediation. The provided documents include a Cisco Security Advisory, a CSAF file, and links to software downloads and vulnerability information.
