Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2542

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's shortcode functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into website content. Specifically, the `id` attribute of the `jotform` shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will execute in the browsers of users who access the affected page, leading to a variety of potential impacts, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing user cookies or session information
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the 'id' attribute of the `[jotform]` shortcode, e.g., `[jotform id='123"onload="alert(1)"']`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Contributor Access or Higher:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level access to WordPress. This means they need to be able to create or edit posts or pages to inject the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable code is located in the `apiEmbedHandler` function of `jotform-wp-embed.php`.
* The fix involves sanitizing the form ID by ensuring it is a digit with `ctype_digit`. The older version of the plugin, which used preg_replace_callback, has been completely removed.
* The vulnerability exists in versions of the Jotform Online Forms plugin up to and including 1.3.1.
* Version 1.3.2 includes a fix for this XSS vulnerability.
* CVE-2024-32527 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
