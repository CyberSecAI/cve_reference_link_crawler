Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the MDF library version 2.1. This occurs when parsing a specially crafted `mdf4` file, specifically when the `ReadData` function is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a heap buffer overflow, which means the program writes beyond the allocated buffer in the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Memory Read:** Attackers can potentially read arbitrary data from memory.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information stored in memory can be leaked.
*   **Potential further compromise:** Depending on the application, further compromise could occur based on the leaked data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious `mdf4` File:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted `mdf4` file designed to trigger the overflow when parsed using the `ReadData` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious File:** The attacker needs the ability to provide or have the vulnerable application process a malicious `mdf4` file.

**Additional Details:**
* The description is consistent with the information in the provided links regarding the CVE.
* The vulnerability is located in the `ReadData` function of the `mdflib` library version 2.1
