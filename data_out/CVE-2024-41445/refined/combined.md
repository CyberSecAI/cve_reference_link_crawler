# CVE-2024-41445 Heap buffer-overflow on MDF library

## Description:

A heap buffer-overflow vulnerability has been identified in MDF Library version 2.1, which may allow attackers to read arbitrary data from memory. This vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted `mdf4` file is parsed using the `ReadData` function, leading to potential data leakage and information disclosure.

## Impact:

Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in memory. Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to read unintended data, potentially leading to further compromise depending on the application environment.
