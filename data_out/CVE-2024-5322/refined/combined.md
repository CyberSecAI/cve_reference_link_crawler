# 2024.3 Release Notes

**Build Number**: 2024.3.0.16 **Last updated**: 7/1/2024

## What's New

#### Security Enhancements

This update includes a critical security fix. In alignment with our commitment to transparency and trust, N-able has [published](https://status.n-able.com/2024/07/02/n-central-critical-security-fix-details/) the details of this security fix in CVE-2024-28200 and CVE-2024-5322. We encourage all partners to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.

#### New N-able Login available for On Prem partners!

N-able Login capabilities (MSP SSO) are now integrated into your N-central instance! We encourage you to enroll if you are using local login and shift to this new method of authentication.

We know that our partners use many tools and are burdened with managing multiple vendors and multiple logins per vendor. Our new login solution is set to solve that by providing you with seamless authentication and access to our products and our comprehensive success resources.

By shifting from local authentication to MSP SSO you will gain:

* Security managed by our ISO certified security standards with MFA.
* Quick access to our partner success resources such as knowledge, support, N-able University training, communities, and Market Builder.
* Seamlessly movement between other N-able products such as Cove, Take Control, Passportal, and more.

Looking ahead, we will be integrating with additional 3rd-party identity providers directly in MSP SSO, such as Entra ID, so that you can have a single location to manage your N-able authentication across your entire N-able universe.

To learn how to enroll your users click [here](https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/User_Management/MSP_SSO_authentication.htm).

#### New Data Domains in Analytics Direct Data Access

In the last few weeks several new data domains have been made available to users of Direct Data Access allowing for more N-central insights by either querying the data directly or connecting it to your own [BI tool](https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/Analytics/About%20Analytics%20data/direct_data_access.htm).

Some highlighted use cases to report on include:

* Last agent check-in by device
* Last logged in user by device
* OS version by device
* AV Status and product by device
* CPU Core count by server
* Managed devices by OS

The new domains cover data related to:

* Antivirus Status and Threats
* Device Logins
* Firewall Incidents
* Network Bandwidth traffic
* Patch Compliance
* Remote Access
* Usage

Learn more about the schemas, table relationships, and get started with basic SQL for each [here](https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/Analytics/About%20Analytics%20data/analytics-data-model.htm). The [data dictionary](https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/Analytics/About%20Analytics%20data/analytics_data_dictionary.htm) has been updated to reflect the changes as well.

#### REST API Endpoint Additions

There are several new REST API endpoints in 2024.3, including:

* Create Device Access Group
* Create Org Unit Access Group
* Device Custom Property Modify
* Org Custom Property Modify
* Create SO
* Create Customer
* Create Site
* Get User Role by role ID
* Add User Role
* Device List by OrgUnitID
* Users List

After upgrading to 2024.3, you can view the updated list of REST API endpoints by navigating to your Swagger Documentation page located at https://Your\_FQDN/api-explorer/.

New endpoints are initially released in a preview state so they will have âPreviewâ prepended to the endpoint description.

#### Device Management for Apple Updates

* Improved overall UI view and terminologies for Mac devices
* Two new columns in Mobile Device view ('Status' to show still enrolled, 'Managed By' to show if it's DMA or Old MDM)
* OS Update monitor: Added a new monitoring service to detect whether new OS updates are available for a device
* Symlink to allow download of latest Mac Agent without needing to know the version for improved use within custom scripting
* DMA added at Customer level: DMA is currently tied to the SO level, this version now allows you to deploy and manage at the customer level.

#### Usability Improvements

* Add Device count to service template âAssociated Devicesâ table
* Add search bar to Dashboard Filters
* Split Password Status and Last Reset Date into two separate columns in Domain User Management
* Additional Device Class âServers â Linuxâ support for AMP based services
* Add Serial Number column to All Devices and Active Issues views

#### Bug Fixes

There are many exciting fixes in this build, including nearly 30 partner reported bug fixes and 90 overall bug fixes. These changes encompass improvements in performance, EDR, Analytics issues with blank dashboards, Patching and more! Be sure to review the full list of included updates below for more details.

## Included updates in N-able N-central

#### N-central 2024.3 GA

If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2023.9, please note that because of the PostgreSQL upgrade included with N-central 2023.9, on-premise partners can expect this upgrade to take longer than previous upgrades may have. Please do NOT reboot your N-central server if the upgrade appears to be stuck. Please check the server console for error messages, or contact Support and they can advise on the progress and status of the upgrade.

| Communication issues may be encountered for N-able N-central Probes installed on Windows servers that have multiple NICs. For more information, refer to 'KBA20020:ConfiguringAServer WithMultipleNICs' in the online Help. | 67778 |

#### Automation Manager

## AV Defender and Backup Manager â D2D

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| Running Automation Manager Policies created using Automation Manager 1.6 or earlier may result in Failed to create an EndDate ... errors if the Policies are run on a computer using a different date format. This issue does not affect Policies created using Automation Manager 1.7 or later. | 65712 |

#### Custom Services

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| Custom services may appear as misconfigured when the system locale of the device is not set to English. For example, in Portuguese the default decimal in c#/.net is not a period, ".", it is a comma, ",". If you are having this issue, please contact N-able Technical Support. | 65288 |

#### Core Functionality

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| Installing N-able N-central on Servers that have an Nvidia Video Card  Due to a bug in CentOS 7 with Nvidia's 'Nouveau' driver, installing N-able N-central on servers that have an Nvidia video card may result in the N-able N-central console showing a blank screen, or displaying an Anaconda Installer screen with an error message about the video card driver. | NCCF-11842 |
| If you have the need to use Conditional Access Policies for your Azure AD/Entra ID linked users, there is a known issue that prevents your users from logging in. We have identified a workaround by using Custom (OpenID Connect) instead. To learn more, click [HERE](https://me.n-able.com/s/article/Conditional-Access-Policies-With-Azure-AD-Authentication-For-N-central). | NCCF-31030 |
| HDM does not work with the 'Last 5 Tickets' widget. | NCCF-10855 |

#### Dashboards

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| Modifying a Dashboard that is associated with a large number of services may cause performance issues when using the Firefox browser. | 70326 |

#### PSA Integration

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| In some instances, tickets closed in PSAs are not being cleared in N-able N-central. This is likely because the ticketing recipient profile in N-able N-central has Do not change the Ticket Status selected (in order to manually configure tickets). Then, when the ticket is removed in the PSA, N-able N-central will not be able to update or resolve the ticket's status and new tickets cannot be created for the same issue. Until a solution is available through the UI for this situation, the work around is to set a Return to Normal status and set a non-used status in the 'updatable statuses' section or set the same status as the return to normal one. This will cause N-able N-central to add a note to the ticket on return to normal but will not alter the ticket's status. This will allow the stale ticket check to remove the ticket from the system. | 65620 |

#### UI

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| When Cove Data Protection is installed on a device, the device details view will not light up the Cove icon in the features row correctly. | NCCF-162108 |
| After re-naming, the Names of files or Registry entries may not be displayed properly in the File System window and the Registry window of the Tools tab when using Internet Explorer. | 68149 |
