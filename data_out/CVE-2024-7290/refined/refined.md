Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `manage_tenant.php` script of the SourceCodester Establishment Billing Management System. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when querying the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `manage_tenant.php` URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability can lead to an escalation of privileges, allowing an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/manage_tenant.php` endpoint, by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker should be familiar with SQL injection techniques and how to exploit them using tools like sqlmap.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided `sqlmap` command and HTTP request demonstrate how the SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited using the tool, and also provides a sample of a vulnerable request with several cookies.
