Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Open Redirect

**Root Cause:** The `congratulation.php` script uses the `$_GET['goto_page']` parameter directly in a `header("Location: ...")` redirect, without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The application redirects the user to a URL specified by an attacker-controlled parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `goto_page` parameter, allowing arbitrary URLs to be used.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites that mimic legitimate ones to steal credentials or sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirect users to websites hosting malicious files or exploits.
*   **Compromise of Trust:** Users might lose trust in the application due to being redirected to unexpected or malicious destinations.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can use redirects to carry out social engineering attacks by directing users to customized content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL, specifically modifying the value of the `goto_page` parameter within the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to be a registered user or have any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `congratulation.php`
*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
    ```php
    <?php
        include './config/connection.php';

        $gotoPage = $_GET['goto_page'];
        $message = $_GET['message'];

        header("Location:$gotoPage?message=$message");

    ?>
    ```
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):**
    `http://192.168.95.115/congratulation.php?goto_page=https://example.com`
    This URL redirects the user to `https://example.com`. An attacker would replace `https://example.com` with a malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in version 2.0 of the Sourcecodester Clinic's Patient Management System.
*   The vulnerability is unauthenticated, which means anyone can exploit it.
*   The provided github content and vuldb content both describe the same vulnerability
