Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**1. Unrestricted Access to Swagger UI & Resources (0x01 filter)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `TokenFilter` does not properly restrict access to the Swagger UI and its resources.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper authentication or authorization for accessing sensitive API documentation endpoints.
*   **Impact:**  Allows unauthenticated users to access API documentation, potentially revealing sensitive information about the system's functionalities, endpoints, and data structures.
*   **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing the `/swagger-ui` and `/swagger-resources` URLs.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges are required.

**2. SQL Injection Vulnerability (0x02 sql & 0x09 sql)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses user-controlled input directly in SQL queries, without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.
*   **Weakness:**  Vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of `dataSource` parameters in `GaeaBaseController#pageList` and dynamic SQL queries in `DataSetServiceImpl#testTransform`, which are influenced by user-provided data (DTO).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers can potentially read or modify sensitive data in the database, bypass authentication and authorization controls, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   The `show databases` example shows how the attacker can extract database information.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Manipulating the `dataSource` parameter in the `/swagger-ui/dataSource/pageList` endpoint.
    *   Providing malicious input to the `dynSentence` parameter in the dataset configuration that eventually gets used as a SQL statement.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**3. Remote Code Execution via JavaScript (0x03 js & 0x04 validationRules)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code through the `validationRules` parameter by using `eval` or by using ScriptEngineManager.
*   **Weakness:**  Use of `eval` on user-provided JavaScript code within `DataSetParamController#verification`, and similar execution in `DataSetServiceImpl#testTransform` when processing `validationRules`. This allows execution of Java code via the Nashorn engine.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE). Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system. The example shows execution of `open -a calculator` on MacOS and a `whoami` command execution.
*  **Attack Vector:**
    *   Manipulating the `validationRules` parameter in dataset parameter configuration, including `sampleItem`.
    *   Providing malicious JavaScript code in the `dataSetParamDtoList` parameter for a `testTransform` API call.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints and manipulate the JSON parameters.

**4. Zip Slip Vulnerability (0x05 zip-spilf)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the filenames within a zipped archive during the import process.
*   **Weakness:**  Vulnerable to zip slip. The `ReportDashboardController#importDashboard` does not prevent extraction of files with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in their names.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could overwrite arbitrary files on the server's file system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a malicious ZIP file containing files with names like `../../../../file.txt`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to upload ZIP files to the vulnerable endpoint.

**5. Insecure JWT handling (0x08 jwt)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application's JWT secret key is likely hardcoded or easily guessable.
*   **Weakness:** The `JwtBean#createToken` method utilizes a static secret.  This allows the possibility of an attacker to create forged JWT tokens, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** An attacker might be able to generate valid JWT tokens and impersonate users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Extract the JWT secret key and forge tokens.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** Access to the JWT secret.

**6. Information Disclosure (0x06)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application exposes sensitive information through the `ReportShareController#detailByCode` endpoint.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authorization or sanitization in the `detailByCode` method which could expose sensitive information based on the `shareCode` parameter, which is used to retrieve data.
*   **Impact:** Potential information disclosure. Attackers could access data they are not supposed to.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `shareCode` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Access to the `/reportShare/detailByCode` endpoint and knowledge of valid `shareCode` parameters.

**7. Groovy Code Execution (0x07 java)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application executes arbitrary Groovy code using `GroovyClassLoader` without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:**  The `GroovyTransformServiceImpl#transform` uses GroovyClassLoader to load code provided by the user, allowing remote code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, similar to the JavaScript vulnerability. Attackers can execute system commands and potentially take over the server.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `transform` parameter to execute Groovy code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and control the Groovy code being loaded.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
The provided content reveals multiple critical vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, remote code execution via JavaScript and Groovy, zip slip, and insecure JWT handling. These weaknesses allow attackers to potentially gain complete control of the server, access sensitive data, and disrupt the application's functionality.
