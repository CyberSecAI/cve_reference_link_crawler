The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52757.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a potential deadlock in the CIFS client when releasing a Message ID (MID). The `release_mid()` function was previously acquiring the `server->mid_lock` spinlock before calling `kref_put(&mid->refcount, __release_mid)`. This spinlock acquisition could lead to a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Potential Deadlock:** The primary weakness is a deadlock scenario. The `release_mid()` function, while holding `server->mid_lock`, could be called from `cifs_demultiplex_thread` while another thread, e.g. `cifs_debug_data_proc_show`, might try to acquire the same lock after already holding the `cifs_tcp_ses_lock`, leading to a deadlock. Specifically, the locking order was:
    - Thread 1: `server->mid_lock` -> `cifs_tcp_ses_lock`
    - Thread 2: `cifs_tcp_ses_lock` -> `server->mid_lock`
- **Unnecessary Locking:** The `server->mid_lock` was found to be unnecessary since all callers of `release_mid()` already hold a reference to the `mid` structure, making the spinlock protection redundant.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Deadlock:** The deadlock will cause the CIFS client to hang, potentially impacting the system's ability to access network shares. This would cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering the specific sequence of events where `release_mid()` is called while another thread holds the `cifs_tcp_ses_lock` and attempts to acquire the `server->mid_lock`. This could be triggered by actions that result in SMB communication and subsequent release of MIDs, and could be caused through an attacker accessing SMB share.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the CIFS client such that the problematic code path is executed. This could be done from a local account.

**Resolution:**
The fix removes the acquisition of `server->mid_lock` within the `release_mid()` function and calls kref_put directly. The code change includes:
- Modify `cifsproto.h` to declare `__release_mid` and define inline `release_mid` to use `kref_put` directly.
- Modify `smb2misc.c` to use `GFP_KERNEL` instead of `GFP_ATOMIC` for `kzalloc`.
- Modify `transport.c` to remove spinlock related operations from the `release_mid` function and directly call `kref_put` to dereference the MID structure, and modify the `__release_mid` definition to `void __release_mid(struct kref *refcount)`.

This change effectively removes the potential deadlock by removing the unnecessary locking, and ensures the `mid` structure is released safely.
