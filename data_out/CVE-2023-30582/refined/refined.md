Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-30582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an inadequate permission model in Node.js version 20. Specifically, the `fs.watchFile` API does not respect the file system read restrictions enforced by the `--allow-fs-read` flag when a non-\* argument is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient permission enforcement:** The experimental permission model fails to prevent file watching using `fs.watchFile` even when explicit read access is not granted through `--allow-fs-read`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Malicious actors can monitor files they don't have explicit read access to, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Abuse:** Attackers exploit the `fs.watchFile` API to monitor files without proper permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Node.js Environment:** The attacker needs to execute code within a Node.js environment where the experimental permission model is enabled with the `--allow-fs-read` flag using a non-\* argument.
*   **No specific permissions:**  No explicit permissions needed other than access to the Node.js environment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Node.js version 20 and the experimental permission model.
*   The `--allow-fs-read` flag is intended to restrict file system read access, but this restriction does not apply to the `fs.watchFile` API in the affected versions.

This vulnerability is rated as medium severity.
