Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-1832:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper authorization check within the Candlepin server component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that the system does not properly enforce access controls, allowing a user or tenant to perform actions on resources that belong to another tenant/customer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker can create data under another customer/tenant's scope which could lead to exposure of sensitive information.
- **Loss of Availability:** The attacker's actions could disrupt services for the targeted customer/tenant, leading to a loss of availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Candlepin server component. Specifically, a user with insufficient privilege can create data under other tenants.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user or tenant in the Candlepin system. They do not need to have any special admin level privileges, but they do need a way to interact with the system to create data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Candlepin versions 4.3.7-3 and 4.3.8-1.
- The fix involves preventing users from creating resources without sufficient authorization, specifically disabling creation of consumers in orgs without proper permission
