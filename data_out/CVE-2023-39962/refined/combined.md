## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 25.0.0, >= 26.0.0, >= 27.0.0

## Patched versions

25.0.9, 26.0.4, 27.0.1

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

>= 19.0.0 >= 20.0.0, >= 21.0.0, >= 22.0.0, >= 23.0.0, >= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0, >= 26.0.0

## Description

### Impact

A malicious user could delete any personal or global external storage, making them inaccessible for everyone else as well.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.9, 26.0.4 or 27.0.1

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 19.0.13.10, 20.0.14.15, 21.0.9.13, 22.2.10.14, 23.0.12.9, 24.0.12.5, 25.0.9, 26.0.4 or 27.0.1

### Workarounds

* Disable app files\_external - Also makes the external storage inaccessible but retains the configurations until a patched version has been deployed

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-39962
