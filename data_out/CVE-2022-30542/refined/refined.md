- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The firmware for certain Intel server boards and systems does not properly validate input, leading to potential privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user and have local access to the affected system.
