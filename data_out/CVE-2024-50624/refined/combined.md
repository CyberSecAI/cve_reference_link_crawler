# KDE MegaRelease 6

## KDEâs next mega release is here!

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/desktop.png)

The KDE community proudly presents Plasma 6, Frameworks 6 and Gear 24.02

Released Wednesday, 28 February 2024

## Plasma 6

KDE Plasma is a modern, feature-rich desktop environment for Linux-based operating systems.
Known for its sleek design, customizable interface, and extensive set of applications, it
is also open source, devoid of ads, and makes protecting your privacy and personal data a
priority.

[Install Plasma](https://kde.org/distributions/) on your current computer and enjoy all the
perks of a state-of-the-art computing experience, even if your hardware is not supported by
Windows 11. You can also opt for [some very elegant machines pre-installed with Plasma](https://kde.org/hardware/)
such as the Steam Deck and many laptops and ultrabooks.

## Two Leaps into the Future

With Plasma 6, our technology stack has undergone two major upgrades: a transition to the
latest version of our application framework, Qt, and a migration to the modern Linux graphics
platform, Wayland. We have done our best to ensure that these changes are as smooth and
unnoticeable to the users as possible, so when you install this update, you will see the same
familiar desktop environment that you know and love. But these under-the-hood upgrades benefit
Plasma's security, efficiency, and performance, and improve support for modern hardware. Thus
Plasma delivers an overall more reliable user experience, while paving the way for many more
improvements in the future.

We will continue providing support for the legacy X11 session for users who prefer to stick with
it for now.

## New Overview Effect

We combined the Overview and Desktop Grid effects into one and massively improved its touchpad gestures.

## **Colors**

Plasma on Wayland now has partial support for [High Dynamic Range
(HDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range). On supported monitors and software,
this will provide you with richer and deeper colors for your games, videos, and visual creations.

Set an [ICC profile](https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2023/12/18/update-on-hdr-and-colormanagement-in-plasma.html)
for each screen individually and Plasma will adjust the colors accordingly. Applications are
still limited to the sRGB color space, but we are working on increasing the number of supported
color spaces soon.

To improve Plasma's accessibility, we added support for [color blindness correction
filters](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/3354). This helps
with protanopia, deuteranopia or tritanopia.

## New Wallpaper

Transform your desktop with the mesmerizing 'Scarlet Tree' wallpaper by axo1otl.
Capture the dynamic interplay between the sun's vibrant energy and the comet's celestial
dance.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/light.png)
![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/dark.png)

Changing your wallpaper can now be done from System Settings. Choose whether you
want to change the wallpaper for one specific screen or all of them at the same time.

## Floating Panel

With Plasma 6, the panel now floats by default.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/panel.png)![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/pannel-conf.png)

Don't like floating panels? No worries, we also redesigned the panel settings to make it
easier to configure everything to your liking.

Panels can now be configured with a new an intelligent auto-hide mode ("Dodge Windows")
that makes them hide when windows touch them.

## New Defaults!

Plasma 6.0 is a major new version, and we decided to change a few default settings
to make it easier to use. Plasma is still as configurable as ever, and you can
change these settings back to how they were in Plasma 5 if you preferred them
that way.

* [Files and folders are now selected with a single-click and opened with a double-click](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/72)
* [Touchpad tap-to-click is enabled by default on Wayland](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/97)
* [Wayland is the default graphical session](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/2188)
* ["Thumbnail Grid" is the new default Task Switcher style](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/53)
* [Clicking on the scrollbar track now scrolls to the clicked location](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/92)
* [Scrolling on the desktop no longer switches virtual desktops](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/55)
* [Panels float by default](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/73)
## Refreshed **Breeze**

Breeze has been overhauled to give it a more modern look and feel, with fewer
frames and more consistent spacing.

## Reorganized Settings

We've improved the Settings app, making it more user-friendly and reducing the
number of nested pages.

On many settings pages, buttons have been relocated to the toolbar, enhancing
consistency with our other applications and creating additional space for the actual
content.

You now have the option to customize your sound theme, and a new default sound theme
named "Ocean" has been introduced to replace the "Oxygen" sound theme.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/settings.png)

Another addition is that you can now easily configure preferred applications
for broad file types, such as all kinds of music and video files.

## The Cube is Back!

Two years ago, some major architectural improvements in KWin had forced us
to temporarily remove the famous cube effect â but now it's finally back!
This effect is perfect to get a clear visualisation of the concept of what
multiple desktops are all about... And also to show off to your friends and
family how cool Plasma is.

## Plasma Search

Plasma Search now lets you customize the ordering of search results.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/krunner.png)

Plasma Search also now lets you convert between timezones. This is handy if
you travel frequently or need to keep in touch with colleagues, friends, and
family in other parts of the world.
[Check out more ways how KDE can help you during your travels](https://kde.org/for/travelers/).

Due to some [refactoring and profiling](https://write.as/alexander-lohnau/profiling-and-optimizing-krunner), Plasma Search is generally faster, and in particular searching for applications and settings pages is a lot faster while also using fewer CPU resources.

* [Search in codeberg and PyPi from KRunner](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kio/-/merge_requests/1462)
* [Searching now matches text in both your current system language and also English](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=467924)
## And More Plasma

### Improved fingerprint unlock from lockscreen

On prior versions you chose between either password or fingerprint
authentication for the lockscreen. In Plasma 6, both are supported at the same time.

### Support for more Islamic Calendars

We now support the Astronomical and Umm al-Qura Calendar in the calendar
applet. This is in addition to the already existing Julian, Milankovic, Chinese Lunar,
Indian, Hebrew, Persian and Islamic Civil calendars.

## Plasma Mobile

The mobile version of Plasma has undergone several enhancements. The updated default home
screen allows users to organize their preferred applications in a grid and group them.

We added a welcome screen on the first launch. This will guide you through configuring
your Wi-Fi, timezone, device scaling, and mobile connection settings.

## Applications

KDE Gear 24.02 brings many applications to Qt 6. In addition to the changes in
Breeze, many applications adopted a more frameless look for their interface.

## Groupware

The Kontact suite received a lot of improvements related to security and privacy.

The KMail email viewer removes ads and tracking code from your emails using a more
powerful ad blocker written in Rust. The email composer now directly shows the validity
and the trust level of the [OpenPGP](https://librepgp.org/) keys of your recipients
and warns you when one of their keys is almost or currently expired.

KOrganizer now lets you send encrypted and signed email invitations â important if your work
requires confidentiality.

Kleopatra, the GnuPG frontend, now lets you view encrypted emails downloaded from web
clients like Gmail that don't support OpenPGP. This will also benefit the many
Windows users of [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/), as Kleopatra is an important
part of this set of security tools.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/kleopatra.png)

In addition of a variety of pre-existing online services, KMail now supports a few
offline and open source AI features. Translations can be configured to use the
[Bergamot](https://browser.mt/) translation model, also used by Firefox. It can
also use the [vosk-api engine](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api) to convert
speech to text.

Note that by default, all these AI features are disabled and you need to explicitly
enable them in the KMail settings.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/kmail.png)
##

## Itinerary

Itinerary is KDE's travel assistant.

We improved the usability of Itinerary on phones by making common actions
available on a bottom navigation bar, which makes it easy to switch to your
passes and your current trip.

The main timeline was redesigned and now entries can be expanded inline to
show the intermediate stops and ongoing delays and disruptions. Speaking of
events, it is now possible to manually add and edit entries and to share
entire trips or single reservations to your phone via KDE Connect.

The indoor map in Itinerary now lists all amenities in the building or area
you are currently looking at. This helps with things like finding a place to grab a
coffee in a big train station, or searching for a place to get food in the
vicinity of your hotel. This feature is powered by OpenStreetMap, works without
the need to connect to the internet and no search terms ever leave your device.

When viewing a trip details, in addition to being able to consult the list of
stops, it can look at a map of the trip.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/itinerary.png)
## KDE Education

Several [KDE Education](https://apps.kde.org/education) apps were updated to Qt 6,
and as part of the porting, their interface got redesigned to meet the current KDE standards.

[KHangMan](https://apps.kde.org/khangman), an adaptation of the [Hangman game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29),
was ported to [Kirigami](https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/). [Kiten](https://apps.kde.org/kiten),
an application for learning Japanese, has a search dialog in its Kanji Browser. [KWordQuiz](https://apps.kde.org/kwordquiz),
a flash card app, includes audio controls for your audio files. [Kalzium](https://apps.kde.org/kalzium)
doesn't use gradients anymore and the colors of the periodic table elements offer better contrast
with your current color scheme.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/edu.png)
## Kdenlive

The big news for KDE's powerful video editor is support for replacing the audio or the video
of a clip in a timeline. This new feature allows you to extract the audio of a clip, modify it
in another program and then update the existing clip with the new audio.

Kdenlive has further enhanced its subtitle feature, allowing you to incorporate multiple
subtitles onto a single track. This is especially useful for videos that demand subtitles in
several languages. You also have the option to import and export subtitles.

Kdenlive will automatically let you know when there is an update available without even requiring
an internet connection.

The clip monitor will list the recently opened clips, and the document checker dialog that appears
when opening a project with missing clips has been completely rewritten.

![Missing clip dialog in Kdenlive](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/kdenlive-missing-clip.png)

## More Kdenlive Features

* [New MLT easing modes for keyframes, like bounce, exponential, etc.](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/kdenlive/-/commit/fbef83b0fb68407919e4fea9d9c384b827bef57a)
* [Allow setting the default interpolation method for scaling on render](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/kdenlive/-/issues/1766)
* [Added a button in timeline clips to easily enable/disable effects](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/kdenlive/-/merge_requests/448)
* [Easily toggle clip effects in the timeline](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/kdenlive/-/merge_requests/448)
## Dolphin

Dolphin is KDE's file and folder explorer... That can do much more.

Apart from Dolphin's overall redesign, the settings received some special care
and were reorganized to make them easier to navigate.

Accessibility improvements are also present in this new version. Toolbar
buttons and the disk space in the status bar are now keyboard-accessible.
You can press `F10` to open the main menu and `Shift`+`F10`
to open context menus. Some of these improvements were also applied to
many other applications.

Right-clicking on a folder will now show an option to open the folder in a
split view.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/dolphin.png)

![](https://apps.kde.org/app-icons/org.kde.spectacle.svg)

## Spectacle

Spectacle is KDE's screenshot utility.

The recently-introduced recording features in Spectacle have been improved
and now show a system tray icon while recording. You can hover over the
icon to see the time recorded. Click the icon, and the recording will finish.

Apart from recording the whole screen or an application window, you can now
also record any arbitrary part of the screen.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/spectacle.png)

New recording shortcuts:

* `Meta`+`R` or `Meta`+`Shift`+`R` for capturing a region
* `Meta`+`Alt`+`R` for a screen
* `Meta`+`Ctrl`+`R` for a window

Note that we changed the default location for saving screenshots and screencasts. You can now find them in
`~/Pictures/Screenshots` and `~/Videos/Screencasts`, respectively.

## And More!

* [Recording quality settings](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/spectacle/-/merge_requests/269)
* [VP9 encoding for video recording](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/spectacle/-/merge_requests/269)
* [Improved handling of multiple displays with different scale factors](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/spectacle/-/merge_requests/296/)
* [Added CLI options for recording](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/spectacle/-/merge_requests/283)
* [New output filename template options and format](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/spectacle/-/merge_requests/300)

![](https://apps.kde.org/app-icons/org.kde.neochat.svg)

## NeoChat

### KDE's Matrix Client

NeoChat is a chat app that lets you take full advantage of the Matrix
network.

In the newest version, when launching the app, you will get a welcome page
that lets you choose which account you want to use and lets you log in to other
accounts. The welcome screen will now warn you when NeoChat cannot load an
account.

NeoChat will let you register a new Matrix account directly from the app itself.
Deactivating your account is also possible from within NeoChat.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/neochat-welcome.png)

Spaces are a relatively new feature of Matrix that let you group
chat channels together. This is used to improve the discoverability of
rooms, manage large communities, or just tidy all the channels you are in.
You can now do all this without leaving NeoChat.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/neochat-space.png)

NeoChat won't let you miss any new notifications anymore. We added a new page that includes all your recent notifications. When NeoChat's Android app is closed, you will still be able to receive [push notifications](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/merge_requests/1416).
The main timeline will let you know when more messages are loading and when you reach the end of it.

### More NeoChat Goodies

* [QR Codes to share contacts](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/merge_requests/1395)
* [Improved room upgrades](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/merge_requests/1349)
* [Added button to reject invitation and ignore user](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/merge_requests/1261)
* [Display device security details](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/merge_requests/1380)
* [Added room security settings](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/merge_requests/1413)
## PlasmaTube

[PlasmaTube](https://apps.kde.org/plasmatube) is a YouTube client using [Invidious](https://invidious.io/).
This new version supports syncing your watch history with your Invidious account and searching
for channels and playlists. It also comes with a new queue system for playlists.

PlasmaTube 24.02 introduces a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode, which allows you to watch videos
in a floating window which stays on top of all the others, so you can keep an eye on what
youâre watching while working on other tasks.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/plasmatube-pip-2.png)

We added limited support for videos from [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/) and
[Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped) too.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/plasmatube.png)

![Screenshot of Plasmatube Picture in Picture mode](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/plasmatube-pip-2.png)
## And much more!

* [Open a video directly by passing it as a command line argument](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/plasmatube/-/merge_requests/56)
* [MPRIS2 support](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/plasmatube/-/merge_requests/70)

* [Basic Android support](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/plasmatube/-/merge_requests/65)
* [Improved video player UX](https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/plasmatube/-/merge_requests/69)
## Tokodon

Tokodon brings the Mastodon federated social media platform to your fingertips. With Tokodon
you can read, post, and message easily. In this release, writing new posts is even easier.
You can set the focal points that your followers will see when viewing your post in their
timeline. Images can be copy-pasted or dropped in the composer. When discarding your draft,
a configuration popup will prevent you from deleting your post by mistake.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/tokodon-post.png)

We give you more control over what you see in Mastodon. You can hide boosts and replies in
your main timeline. Reporting and muting accounts is now more accessible, with these actions
directly available from the timeline. You can also leave comments when you report an
offending account.

We completely redesigned the first launch experience, allowing you to learn
more about Mastodon, log in to your existing account, and register an
account on a server. Additionally, Tokodon will give you some explanation
about errors encountered during login and give you the possibility to try
again.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/tokodon-signing.png)

We also redesigned the profile pages. The new profile page allows
filtering posts on a profile by their featured tags.

![](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/tokodon-profile.png)

## And much more!

* [Color themes support on Android](https://invent.kde.org/network/tokodon/-/merge_requests/319)

Kate is one of KDE's powerful text editors/IDEs. Kate's LSP uses a new JSON parser called
RapidJSON and now returns completion results with more speed and less memory usage. LSP support
is also now more complete and will display dialogs when [the server asks for them](https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kate/-/merge_requests/1284).

## More Kate goodies

* [Automatic LSP setup for CSS, SCSS, LESS, XML, Julia and PHP](https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kate/-/merge_requests/1331)
* [Automatic DAP setup for Dart and Flutter](https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kate/-/merge_requests/1243)
* [Synchronize the scrolling for split views](https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kate/-/merge_requests/1203)
* [Text to speech support](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/ktexteditor/-/merge_requests/606)
## Konsole and Yakuake

In Gear 24.02, apart from being ported to Qt 6, we redesigned the settings of
Konsole, and Yakuake and Konsole's rendering is now more performant with
[50% fewer memory allocations](https://invent.kde.org/utilities/konsole/-/merge_requests/913).

People using Konsole with Chinese, Japanese, or Korean scripts will be happy
to hear that text selection is now working correctly.

Konsole now puts every tab in a separate [cgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups).
This avoids the entire application getting killed when the system is suffering
from high memory load and needs to save some memory by terminating processes.

## But wait, there's even more

### KClock

KClock will pause any media sources (media players, streaming services,
etc.) when an alarm or timer rings, and then resume them when the alarm
is dismissed.

### KDE Connect

KDE Connect can now connect to other devices via Bluetooth. This may be
less reliable than the current Wi-Fi backend, but can be useful when your two
devices are not connected to the same Wi-Fi network or when are separated
by a firewall.

In terms of discoverability, KDE Connect now also
supports [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS) which is
better at finding other devices in your network and less often blocked
by the network configuration.

### Kasts, Podcast Player

Fetching new feed updates is now dramatically faster by not
parsing RSS feeds if they haven't changed.

### Elisa, Music Player

The starting point of the file view can now be configured to another directory
or storage disk. Various metadata dialogs got improved on mobile. We switched
to a stack-based history mode for the navigation.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=487882#c0)  shushangw    2024-06-01 12:58:05 UTC  ``` Summary: Send a plain HTTP request (<https://github.com/KDE/kmail-account-wizard/blob/master/src/ispdbservice.cpp#L29>) to retrieve the mail server's configuration file in the K-mail account wizard.  May result: Consider an attack scenario in which the attacker and the victim are both located in a coffee shop, sharing the same Wi-Fi network. The attacker can tamper with any content transmitted over the plaintext connection. For example, specify the target mail server as an attacker-controlled server.  If it is deliberate not to implement HTTPS, what is the reason for doing so? ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=487882#c1)  Laurent Montel    2024-06-03 05:26:06 UTC  ``` see [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird%3AAutoconfiguration) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=487882#c2)  shushangw    2024-06-03 09:17:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to Laurent Montel from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=487882#c1)) > see [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird%3AAutoconfiguration)  Thank you for your reply. However, for a more secure implementation, Kmail should at least try https first and fall back to http requests in case it can't retrieve the configuration file successfully.  Also, the latest specification and discussion of autoconfiguration are referenced in: - <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bucksch-autoconfig/00/> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=487882#c3)  Laurent Montel    2024-06-03 11:43:40 UTC  ``` Git commit 9784f5ab41c3aff435d4a88afb25585180a62ee4 by Laurent Montel.
