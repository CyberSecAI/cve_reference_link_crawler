Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46255:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way the application handles malformed datastore URIs. When a provided URI cannot be parsed, the application was previously logging the full URI, which includes sensitive information such as passwords, in plaintext. This happens specifically when parsing database connection strings (postgres, mysql, spanner, cockroachdb). The parsing errors can include passwords that contain characters like ":" which would cause the parse to fail.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information, specifically database passwords, in application logs.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or redact the datastore URI before including it in error messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to the application logs can obtain database credentials, potentially granting unauthorized access to the database and its sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's logging mechanism. An attacker who has access to the logs could read the exposed database passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the application's logs. This could be achieved through various means, depending on how the logs are stored and accessed.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the application or database server to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `github.com/authzed/spicedb` prior to 1.27.0-rc1.
- The fix involves redacting the sensitive parts of the connection string before logging any error. Specifically, the fix replaces the full URI and the problematic password within the error message with "(redacted)". This change is implemented across all supported datastore types: CockroachDB, MySQL, Postgres, and Spanner.
- The fix includes a test case to verify that the sensitive information is properly redacted in error messages.
- The CVSS score is 4.2 with vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` which indicates that the vulnerability is only exploitable with local access by a high privileged user, which is contradictory to the vulnerability description as any user with access to logs can potentially read the password.
