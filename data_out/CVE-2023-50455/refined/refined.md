- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing rate limiting in the 'email address verification' feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of rate limiting, allowing an attacker to send numerous email verification requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS) due to the generation of many emails. The victim may also be spammed.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a large number of email address verification requests for a known email address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have knowledge of a valid email address that is used in the Zammad system. They can then repeatedly send verification requests to that address.
