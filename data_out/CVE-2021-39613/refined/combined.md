Hard-coded credentials for multiple users in firmware of D-Link DVG-3104MS and DVX-2000MS
=========================================================================================
Product: D-Link DVG-3104MS, D-Link DVX-2000MS
CVE: not yet assigned
CWE: CWE-259, CWE-798
Risk factor: Critical
Found: 2021-08-06
Researcher: Daniel Nussko
CVSS Base Score
===============
CVSSv3 Overall Score: 9.8 (Critical)
CVSSv3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Description
===========
In D-Link products DVG-3104MS and DVX-2000MS there are hard-coded credentials for undocumented user accounts in the '/etc/passwd' file. As weak passwords have been used, the plaintext passwords can be recovered from the hash values. With both, username and password, an attacker is able to log in via Telnet and thus gain access to the underlying embedded Linux operating system on the device.
Proof of Concept
================
1. Connect to the device
2. Read '/etc/passwd'
root:lAY[...]VDo:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
CLI:lAY[...]VDo:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
demo:U0d[...]StA:5000:5000:Demo User:/home/demo:/bin/bash
maintain:c2S[...]Siw:6000:6000:maintainer:/var:/bin/sh
nobody:\*:32767:32767:Nobody:/home/demo:/bin/bash
cloudraker:$1$$8Zd[...]NZ1:32770:32770:Linux User,,,:/home/cloudraker:/bin/sh
pmc:$1$$1BT[...]Hd/:32771:32771:Linux User,,,:/home/pmc:/bin/sh
3. After performing a dictionary attack on the password hashes, the following passwords have beeen recovered:
Username | Password
-----------------------
root | [...]
CLI | [...]
cloudraker | [...]
maintain | [...]
pmc | [...]
demo | [...]
Impact
======
The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device.
Recommendation
==============
Remove hard-coded credentials from the firmware of the affected devices.
Affected Devices
================
- D-Link DVX-2000MS
- D-Link DVG-3104MS (1.0.2.0.4E)
- D-Link DVG-3104MS (1.0.2.0.4)
- D-Link DVG-3104MS (1.0.2.0.3)
Timeline
========
2021-08-07: Vendor informed via email
2021-08-10: Vendor answered and stated that the affected products have reached their End-of-Service-Life
2021-08-17: Vendor published an announcement about the affected products

   - **Publically Disclosed:**  [Link](https://www.nussko.com/advisories/advisory-2021-08-01.txt)

**Affected Models**

| **Model** | **Region** | **Hardware Revision** | **End of Support** | **Legacy Website** | **Last Updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DVG-3104MS | Worldwide | All H/W Revisions | 2011 | YES | 08/16/2021 |

Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
