Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `wpem_remove_menu_entry` AJAX action in the WP Edit Menu plugin lacked proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The AJAX action did not verify if the user was authorized to delete posts before processing the request. Specifically, it did not check if the user had the `administrator` capability before allowing the post deletion.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The code was vulnerable to CSRF attacks as it did not include any nonce verification.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** An unauthenticated attacker could delete arbitrary posts or pages from the WordPress site by sending a crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable `filter_menu` action.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct AJAX request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=filter_menu` parameter, along with the ID of the post to be deleted within the `val` parameter (sent via POST or GET request).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided links show the code changes made to fix the vulnerability, specifically in `includes/class-wpem-main.php`. The fix includes adding a check for `current_user_can('administrator')` to ensure only administrators can delete posts and switching from `$_REQUEST` to `$_POST` to prevent GET based attacks.

This information confirms the description of CVE-2022-2276.
