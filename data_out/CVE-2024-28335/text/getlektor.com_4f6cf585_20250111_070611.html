# Quickstart

The best way to get started with Lektor is to use the `quickstart` command to
let Lektor generate a basic project layout for you. This requires the use of
the command line client which is the recommended way to do development until
the website is ready for end user management.

If you do not have the `lektor` [command line executable](../cli/)
available yet just consult the [Installation](../installation/) section of
the documentation.

## Creating a New Project

To create a new project open a terminal and navigate to the preferred location
of your project. Then execute the quickstart command to create a new project:

```
$ lektor quickstart

```

This will ask you a few questions and then create a new Lektor project with
some basic configuration for you.

## Screencast

If you want a video walkthrough you can have a look at the screencast which
explains the quickstart project a bit:

## Running your Project

Now that you have a project you can run it. As a developer the easiest way to
do that is to use the `server` which runs the project on your local machine
as if it was a dynamic website.

All you have to do is to enter your project directory and run it:

```
$ cd yourproject
$ lektor server

```

This will automatically start the server and you can navigate to
[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) to open the project.

You can keep the server running, it will automatically rebuild your files as
they change.

## Accessing the Admin

While the development server is running you can use the built-in admin
interface. It can be accessed by clicking on the pencil symbol on a page
or by manually navigating to `/admin/`.

## Building

When you want to build the website for distribution you can make Lektor build
everything into static files. In fact, that's already happening in the
background while the development server is running. If you want to trigger
a build you can use the `build` command. By default it builds into a lektor
cache directory.

```
$ lektor build

```

You can also explicitly provide a path if you are not satisfied with the
default directory. To see where this directory is you can use the
`project-info` command:

```
$ lektor project-info --output-path
/Users/john/.../build-cache/6fdaeecab78d6aa99f86f586ab15da06

```

All your generated files will end up in that folder for easy publishing.

## Next Steps

Now that you have done that, you might be interested in diving deeper into
Lektor. These might be good next steps:

* The [Guides](../guides/) which cover common setups.
* The [Deployment Documentation](../deployment/) which shows how to
  deploy a website to production.
* [Data Modelling](../models/) for everything about how to model your
  data.

This website is built on Lektor as well. You can find the sources of it
[on GitHub](https://github.com/lektor/lektor-website/) and you can click
at any point on the source symbol () on the bottom
to see the source for the current page.
