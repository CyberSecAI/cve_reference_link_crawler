# Quickstart

The best way to get started with Lektor is to use the `quickstart` command to
let Lektor generate a basic project layout for you. This requires the use of
the command line client which is the recommended way to do development until
the website is ready for end user management.

If you do not have the `lektor` [command line executable](../cli/)
available yet just consult the [Installation](../installation/) section of
the documentation.

## Creating a New Project

To create a new project open a terminal and navigate to the preferred location
of your project. Then execute the quickstart command to create a new project:

```
$ lektor quickstart

```

This will ask you a few questions and then create a new Lektor project with
some basic configuration for you.

## Screencast

If you want a video walkthrough you can have a look at the screencast which
explains the quickstart project a bit:

## Running your Project

Now that you have a project you can run it. As a developer the easiest way to
do that is to use the `server` which runs the project on your local machine
as if it was a dynamic website.

All you have to do is to enter your project directory and run it:

```
$ cd yourproject
$ lektor server

```

This will automatically start the server and you can navigate to
[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) to open the project.

You can keep the server running, it will automatically rebuild your files as
they change.

## Accessing the Admin

While the development server is running you can use the built-in admin
interface. It can be accessed by clicking on the pencil symbol on a page
or by manually navigating to `/admin/`.

![screenshot of the admin](admin.png)

## Building

When you want to build the website for distribution you can make Lektor build
everything into static files. In fact, that's already happening in the
background while the development server is running. If you want to trigger
a build you can use the `build` command. By default it builds into a lektor
cache directory.

```
$ lektor build

```

You can also explicitly provide a path if you are not satisfied with the
default directory. To see where this directory is you can use the
`project-info` command:

```
$ lektor project-info --output-path
/Users/john/.../build-cache/6fdaeecab78d6aa99f86f586ab15da06

```

All your generated files will end up in that folder for easy publishing.

## Next Steps

Now that you have done that, you might be interested in diving deeper into
Lektor. These might be good next steps:

* The [Guides](../guides/) which cover common setups.
* The [Deployment Documentation](../deployment/) which shows how to
  deploy a website to production.
* [Data Modelling](../models/) for everything about how to model your
  data.

This website is built on Lektor as well. You can find the sources of it
[on GitHub](https://github.com/lektor/lektor-website/) and you can click
at any point on the source symbol () on the bottom
to see the source for the current page.

![A browser prompt asking the user if they would like to grant access to localhost resources](/static-assets/images/optimized/privacy-updates/images/27-prompt.jpg)

Starting in version 1.54, Brave for desktop and Android will include more powerful features for controlling which sites can access local network resources, and for how long. Most popular browsers allow websites to access local network resources without protection or restriction, which puts users’ privacy and security at risk. [Many popular websites query your local network](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/05/websites_conduc.html), often as a fingerprinting technique; others do so to observe and possibly exploit information from other software running on your machine.

Brave is the first popular browser to extend the Web’s permission API to control when sites can access localhost resources. Brave’s implementation allows advanced users to give any site access to localhost resources, while also avoiding the annoyance of prompts that a localhost request is likely malicious. Brave’s implementation also takes advantage of [existing improvements Brave has made to Web permissions](/privacy-updates/8-grab-bag-2/#improved-web-permission-lifetimes).

## What are localhost resources, and why might sites want to access them?

“Localhost resources” is a broad term that refers to resources (images, web pages, etc.) that websites can access, but which don’t come from the “Web.” Instead, these resources are hosted (often unknowingly) by other software on your computer.

Surprising though it may be, most browsers allow websites to access these local resources just as easily as they can access other resources on the Web. Browsers allow websites to access localhost resources for a range of reasons, but the *main* two reasons are historical legacy (i.e. it’s always been done this way) and backwards compatibility. Browsers used to be less concerned about user privacy, and so didn’t enforce distinctions between first-party resources (those hosted by the site you’re visiting), third-party resources (those hosted on other public websites), and localhost resources.

Thanks to this historical “accident,” a small but important amount of software has been built expecting to be freely accessible by websites, often in ways invisible to users. And many of these uses are benign. Examples include some wallets for cryptocurrencies, [security software provided by banks](https://palant.info/2023/01/02/south-koreas-online-security-dead-end/) or security companies, and hardware devices that use certain Web interfaces for configuration.

In some situations, browsers also allow public websites to access localhost resources to help developers test their software.

Unfortunately, a wide range of malicious, user-harming software on the Web [uses access to localhost resources for malicious reasons](https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/). For example, fingerprinting scripts try to detect unique patterns in the other software you have running on your device to re-identify you, and other scripts try to identify insecure and vulnerable software on the machine and try to exploit it.

## How does this change affect how websites can access localhost resources in Brave?

Brave is the only popular browser to ship multiple protections against sites maliciously accessing localhost resources. Brave currently uses filter list rules to:

* Block scripts known to maliciously scan localhost resources
* Block requests from public sites to localhost resourcesÂ

This is in contrast to other browsers, which generally ship no protections against sites accessing localhost resources (see the next section for some caveats).

Brave will soon start rolling out a new approach for protecting users against sites abusing local network resources. This new system will have the following parts:

* Requests to localhost resources, from a localhost context are allowed automatically; Brave does not block a locally hosted page from accessing other locally hosted resources. [1](#fn:1)
* Brave will continue to use filter list rules to block scripts and sites known to abuse localhost resources.
* Brave will include a new permission called the “localhost” permission. Only sites with this permission will be able to make sub-resource requests to localhost resources. By default, no sites have this permission and, importantly, most sites have no way to prompt users for this permission. However, advanced users can use the existing site settings interface to grant sites this permission. [2](#fn:2)
* Brave will also include a list of trusted sites, or sites known to access localhost resources for user-benefiting reasons. The first time a site on this list initiates a sub-request to a localhost resource, it will trigger a permission prompt of the previously mentioned localhost permission. This list [is publicly available](https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-lists/localhost-permission-allow-list.txt), and will be maintained by Brave.

Brave has chosen to implement the localhost permission in this multistep way for several reasons. Most importantly, we expect that abuse of localhost resources is far more common than user-benefiting cases, and we want to avoid presenting users with permission dialogs for requests we expect will only cause harm.

Additionally, we’re purposely inserting a permission prompt into a situation where sites won’t expect it (or even realize third-party scripts are trying to access localhost resources), and so we want to further limit the permission prompt to situations where we expect it’s beneficial to users and sites alike.

## How do other browsers handle connections to localhost resources?

As mentioned, most other browsers do not significantly prevent websites from accessing localhost resources. The desktop versions of Firefox and Chrome allow both secure and insecure public sites to access localhost resources, and seem to intend to allow public secure sites to access localhost resources indefinitely.

As a side-effect of security restrictions, [Safari currently blocks requests](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934) to localhost resources (as do other WebKit browsers) from secure public websites. But to the best of our understanding, Safari does not explicitly intend to block these requests from public websites.

As far as we can tell, Brave is the only browser that will block requests to localhost resources from both secure and *insecure* public sites, while still maintaining a compatibility path for sites that users trust (in the form of the discussed localhost permission).

## What’s next for localhost resource handling in Brave?

We’re excited to share this work with Brave users, and expect it to make the Brave browser even more powerful without harming user privacy. However, there’s more work to be done to improve how browsers handle localhost resources.

First, we’re exploring ways to better explain to users what localhost resources are, while they’re using Brave. Once we’re confident we’ve found a way of explaining what the permission controls that non-advanced users can understand, we plan on making the permission available to all sites, and not only those on our list.

Second, we’re pushing these protections deeper in the network stack, so that Brave can protect users against additional, less common methods of sites making localhost requests (including DNS records that refer to localhost). We also hope to have more to share soon.

Third, we’re interested in unifying and expanding how we can apply permissions (or permissions-like controls) to network requests in general. Brave already applies [permissions protections to Google login requests that require third-party cookies](/privacy-updates/24-google-sign-in-permission/), and we’re interested in seeing what other similar uses make sense. The main difficulty here is applying an asynchronous permission model to requests that are often made with synchronous expectations. Again, we’re exploring several options, both within Brave and with external researchers, and hope to have more to share soon.

1. Brave’s localhost protections do not apply to aliases the user may have installed for localhost, such as in `/etc/hosts`. See the final section of this blog post for more details. [↩︎](#fnref:1)
2. On Desktop, users can grant sites the localhost permission at `brave://settings/content/localhostAccess`. Android users can do the same by visiting `Settings > Site settings > Localhost Access`. [↩︎](#fnref:2)
