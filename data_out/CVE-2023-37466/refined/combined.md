# Sandbox Escape

Critical

[patriksimek](/patriksimek)
published
GHSA-cchq-frgv-rjh5
Jul 12, 2023

## Package

npm

vm2
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 3.9.19

## Patched versions

None

## Description

In vm2 for versions up to 3.9.19, `Promise` handler sanitization can be bypassed, allowing attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code.

### Impact

Remote Code Execution, assuming the attacker has arbitrary code execution primitive inside the context of vm2 sandbox.

### Patches

None.

### Workarounds

None.

### References

PoC - <https://gist.github.com/leesh3288/f693061e6523c97274ad5298eb2c74e9>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
