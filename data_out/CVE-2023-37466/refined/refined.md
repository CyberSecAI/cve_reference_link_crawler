{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the improper sanitization of `Promise` handlers within the vm2 sandbox environment.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Bypass in Promise handler sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker with arbitrary code execution within the vm2 sandbox can escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code on the host system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs an initial foothold with the ability to execute arbitrary code inside the vm2 sandbox."
