**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the exposure of a Discord account access token within the `config.json` file, which was committed to the public repository.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the inclusion of a sensitive credential (Discord token) in a publicly accessible file within the repository. This is a hardcoded credential vulnerability, also known as a secret exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to the associated Discord account. This could lead to:
- Data breaches
- Financial loss
- Reputational damage
- Malicious actions on behalf of the account owner
- Legal consequences for the owner of the repository.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, as the repository is publicly accessible on GitHub. Any attacker with internet access can potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs no special privileges or user interaction. The attacker only needs internet access and the ability to view the public repository on GitHub to obtain the exposed token.
