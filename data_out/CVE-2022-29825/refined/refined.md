Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-29825:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a **hard-coded password** within the affected software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password** - The software contains a password that is embedded directly within the code or configuration, making it easily discoverable and exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure**:  Sensitive information could be disclosed, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Unauthorized Access/Control**: An attacker could view programs and project files, or execute programs without proper authorization. This could allow for modification of configurations, sabotage, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, suggesting the attacker needs some form of access to the system where the affected software is installed to leverage this vulnerability. The exploit can be achieved through local access, but with a "high" attack complexity.
*   **Low Privileges:** A low privilege level is required for this attack, meaning an attacker does not need high-level administrative access to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker can be a low-privileged user on the system.
*   **High Attack Complexity:** While local access is needed, the attacker needs some specific conditions or knowledge in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** This vulnerability affects various versions of Mitsubishi Electric FA Engineering Software, including:
    *   GX Works3 (multiple versions up to 1.095Z).
    *  GT Designer3 Version1 (GOT2000) (versions 1.122C to 1.290C)

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.6, with a vector string of `AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N`.

**Mitigation:**

*   Update to the latest versions of the software as provided by Mitsubishi Electric.
*   Set the security key's secure mode to "enable" within the software's settings.
*   Ensure malicious actors cannot access project files, configuration files, and security keys stored on the host machine via untrusted networks.
*   Install antivirus software on the host machine running the software.
*  Encrypt project files and security keys when sending or receiving over the internet.
