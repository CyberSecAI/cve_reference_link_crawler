{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `todo-regex` package is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack due to a poorly written regular expression.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted input string can cause the regular expression matching to take an extremely long time, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted string to the `todo-regex` regular expression.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to pass a crafted string to the vulnerable regex function."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided code snippet demonstrates the vulnerability by creating increasingly long strings that trigger the ReDoS. The code shows how the processing time increases drastically with longer strings."
