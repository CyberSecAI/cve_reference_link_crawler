The Getwid â€“ Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the recaptcha_api_key_manage function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to add, modify, or delete the 'Recaptcha Site Key' and 'Recaptcha Secret Key' settings.
