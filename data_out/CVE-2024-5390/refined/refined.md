Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `listofstudent.php` file of the Online Student Enrollment System Project. This is due to the lack of proper input validation for the `lname` parameter, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses the user-supplied `lname` parameter in SQL queries without sanitization or parameterization, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
* **Insufficient input validation:** The application does not properly validate and filter user input, specifically the `lname` parameter, before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
* **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
* **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
* **Comprehensive system control:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to complete system compromise.
* **Service interruption:**  Attackers can potentially disrupt the application's service.

**Attack vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request where the `lname` parameter contains malicious SQL code.
* **`lname` parameter:** The `lname` parameter in the `listofstudent.php` file is the vulnerable entry point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
* **Basic knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads.
* **No authentication required:** Based on the description, no authentication seems to be required for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is present in `listofstudent.php` file.
* The affected software is Itsourcecode Online Student Enrollment System Project in PHP, version 1.0.
* The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query techniques.
* A sample `sqlmap` command and screenshots from the tool are provided, indicating the vulnerability is easily exploitable.
