Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-8907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect permission check within Bamboo when creating deployment projects. Specifically, Bamboo did not properly verify if a user attempting to create a deployment project possessed the necessary "edit" permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue is a lack of proper authorization checks, allowing users without the required "edit" permission to initiate deployment project creation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can create a deployment project, and through it, execute arbitrary code on a Bamboo Agent.
- **System Compromise:** If a local agent is enabled (which is the default setting), the code execution can occur on the system hosting the Bamboo instance, potentially compromising the server itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Bamboo web interface, by a logged-in user attempting to create a deployment project without the necessary permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Bamboo User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the affected Bamboo instance.
- **Lack of Edit Permissions:** The attacker must *not* have the "edit" permission for deployment projects.
- **Existing Plan with a Green Build:** An existing plan with a successful ("green") build is required for the exploit to work.

**Affected Versions:**
- Bamboo versions 5.0.0 up to but not including 5.15.7
- Bamboo versions 6.0.0 up to but not including 6.0.1

**Fixed Versions:**
- Bamboo 5.15.7
- Bamboo 6.0.1

**Severity:**
- Critical

**Additional Notes:**
- Atlassian Cloud instances were already upgraded to versions unaffected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Iordache Cosmin (@inhibitor181).
