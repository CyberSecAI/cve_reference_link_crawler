## Incorrect permission check for deployment projects - CVE-2017-8907

Note: As of  September 2014 we are no longer issuing binary bug patches, instead we create new maintenance releases for the major versions we are backporting.

| Summary | CVE-2017-8907 - Incorrect permission check for deployment projects |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory Release Date | 14 Jun 2017  10 AM PDT (Pacific Time, -7 hours) |
| Product | Bamboo |
| Affected Bamboo Versions | * 5.0.0 <= version < 5.15.7 * 6.0.0 <= version < 6.0.1 |
| Fixed Bamboo Versions | * for 5.15.x, Bamboo**5.15.7** has been released with a fix for this issue. * for 6.0.x, Bamboo **6.0.1** has been released with a fix for this issue. |
| CVE ID(s) | * CVE-2017-8907 |

**Summary of Vulnerability**

This advisory discloses a **critical severity** security vulnerability which was introduced in version 5.0 of Bamboo.Versions of Bamboostarting with 5.0.0 before 5.15.7 (the fixed version for 5.15.x) and from 6.0.0 before 6.0.1 (the fixed version for 6.0.x) are affected by this vulnerability.

**Atlassian Cloud** instances have **already been upgraded** to a version of Bamboo which does **not** have the issue described on this page.

**Customers who have upgraded Bamboo to version 5.15.7 **or 6.0.1**** **are** **not affected****.**

**Customers who have downloaded and installed Bamboo >= **5.0.0** less than **5.15.7** (the fixed version for 5.15.x)**

Please **upgrade your** Bamboo installations **immediately** to fix this vulnerability.

### **Incorrect permission check for deployment projects (CVE-2017-8907)**

**Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

**Description**

Bamboo did not correctly check if a user creating a deployment project had the **edit** permission and therefore the rights to do so. An attacker who can login to Bamboo as a user without the **edit** permission for deployment projects is able to use this vulnerability, provided there is an existing plan with a green build, to create a deployment project and execute arbitrary code on an available Bamboo Agent. By default a local agent is enabled this means that code execution can occur on the system hosting Bamboo as the user running Bamboo.

Versions of Bamboo starting with 5.0.0 before 5.15.7 (the fixed version for 5.15.x) and from 6.0.0 before 6.0.1 (the fixed version for 6.0.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here: <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-18405>

Acknowledgements

Atlassian would like to credit Iordache Cosmin (@inhibitor181) for reporting this issue to us.

**Fix**

We have taken the following steps to address this issue:

1. Released Bambooversion 6.0.1 that contains a fix for this issue.
