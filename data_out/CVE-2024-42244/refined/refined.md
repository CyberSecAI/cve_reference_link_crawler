The provided content contains multiple commits that address the same vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `mos7840` USB serial driver. All commits are related to the same root cause and fix.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `mos7840` USB serial driver's handling of resume operations after a system suspend.  Prior to the fix, the driver did not have dedicated suspend/resume functions. Because of this, the USB serial core would call a generic resume implementation. Due to a previous change, the driver started using multiple read URBs (USB Request Blocks). The generic resume implementation caused both URBs to be submitted on resume, but the second read URBâ€™s context pointer was not correctly set to the `mos7840` port structure, but rather left pointing to the core. This resulted in a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of read URB context pointers during resume.
- Lack of dedicated suspend and resume functions in the `mos7840` driver, relying on generic USB serial core implementations.
- Race conditions on resume.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash upon system resume
- Potential denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a system suspend and subsequent resume when a `mos7840` based USB serial device is in use with open ports.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  A user with the ability to cause a system suspend and resume.
-  A system using a `mos7840` based USB serial device with active ports.

**Summary of the fix:**
The fix implements dedicated `mos7840_suspend` and `mos7840_resume` functions within the `mos7840` USB serial driver.

-   **`mos7840_suspend`:** This function iterates through all active ports of the serial device, kills any ongoing read URBs, and sets the `read_urb_busy` flag to false.
-   **`mos7840_resume`:** This function also iterates through active ports, sets the `read_urb_busy` flag to true, and resubmits the read URBs. Also handles cases where the resubmission fails and sets `read_urb_busy` flag to false.

This fix ensures that the URB context pointers are correctly set during the resume process, preventing the kernel crash.

The fix was also tested with a "Delock 87414 USB 2.0 to 4x serial adapter".
