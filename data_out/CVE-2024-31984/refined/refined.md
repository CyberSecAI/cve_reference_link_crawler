  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Solr space facet in XWiki was not properly escaping the space title, allowing for the execution of Groovy code embedded within the title.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization/escaping",
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, potentially leading to complete compromise of the XWiki installation, including data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
    "attack_vectors": "A user with permission to edit space titles can inject malicious code into the title, which will be executed when the space facet is rendered in search results.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have user privileges to create or edit a document and/or space title, which is the default for most users."
