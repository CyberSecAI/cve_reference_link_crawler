* [gh-114572](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572): Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
[openssl/openssl#23224](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224) for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

* Add missing X509_STORE_get1_objects failure check

* Add blurb
```

[gh-114572](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572): Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs ([GH-114573](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114573))

* [gh-114572](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572): Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
[openssl/openssl#23224](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224) for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

* Add missing X509_STORE_get1_objects failure check

* Add blurb

* gh-114572: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224 for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

* Add missing X509_STORE_get1_objects failure check

-------- Forwarded Message --------
Subject: 	[Security-announce][CVE-2024-0397] Memory race condition in
ssl.SSLContext certificate store methods
Date: 	Mon, 17 Jun 2024 09:02:21 -0500
From: 	Seth Larson <seth@...hon.org>
Reply-To: 	security-sig@...hon.org
To: 	security-announce@...hon.org

A defect was discovered in the Python “ssl” module where there is a memory race
condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods “cert_store_stats()” and
“get_ca_certs()”. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are called
at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext, such as during
the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured. This issue is fixed
in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.

Severity: Low

* [gh-114572](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572): Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
[openssl/openssl#23224](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224) for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

* Add missing X509_STORE_get1_objects failure check

* Add blurb

cert\_store\_stats and get\_ca\_certs query the SSLContext's X509\_STORE with X509\_STORE\_get0\_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See [openssl/openssl#23224](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224) for details.

Instead, use X509\_STORE\_get1\_objects, newly added in that PR. X509\_STORE\_get1\_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can polyfill it with X509\_STORE\_lock and X509\_STORE\_unlock.

Thanks for submitting this David!

This change feels newsworthy, can we get a news entry for this change using [blurb](https://devguide.python.org/core-developers/committing/#how-to-add-a-news-entry)?

I've reviewed the approach and I'm happy with it but will need a core developers' review before it can be merged.

From looking at all the OpenSSL docs this appears to be correct? I'm less versed with the OpenSSL API than the submitter :)

This will be needed for https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114573.
Along the way, document the various functions that expose \"query from
X509_STORE\". Most of them unfortunately leak the weird caching thing
that hash_dir does, as well as OpenSSL's generally poor handling of
issuers with the same name and CRL lookup, but I don't think it's really
worth trying to unexport these APIs.

| ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Buildbot failure ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Hi! The buildbot **x86-64 MacOS Intel ASAN NoGIL 3.x** has failed when building commit [bce6931](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab).  What do you need to do:   1. Don't panic. 2. Check [the buildbot page in the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/buildbots/) if you don't know what the buildbots are or how they work. 3. Go to the page of the buildbot that failed (<https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/1366/builds/282>) and take a look at the build logs. 4. Check if the failure is related to this commit ([bce6931](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab)) or if it is a false positive. 5. If the failure is related to this commit, please, reflect that on the issue and make a new Pull Request with a fix.   You can take a look at the buildbot page here:  <https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/1366/builds/282>  Failed tests:   * test\_interpreters   Summary of the results of the build (if available):  ==  Click to see traceback logs ``` remote: Enumerating objects: 9, done.         remote: Counting objects:  16% (1/6)         remote: Counting objects:  33% (2/6)         remote: Counting objects:  50% (3/6)         remote: Counting objects:  66% (4/6)         remote: Counting objects:  83% (5/6)         remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6)         remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.         remote: Compressing objects:  16% (1/6)         remote: Compressing objects:  33% (2/6)         remote: Compressing objects:  50% (3/6)         remote: Compressing objects:  66% (4/6)         remote: Compressing objects:  83% (5/6)         remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6)         remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.         remote: Total 9 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 3         From https://github.com/python/cpython  * branch                  main       -> FETCH_HEAD Note: switching to 'bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab'.

`[pythongh-114572](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572)[: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs (](/miss-islington/cpython/commit/5ecee311d613c8e5dc5510245eda0f9781b5daed "gh-114572: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs (GH-114573)

* gh-114572: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224 for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

`[Reduce compiler ability to optimise to statisfy gcc 9.5 (](/WillChilds-Klein/aws-lc/commit/daf5bc9ce1f43a4447a9df1164b2a0c083bdbebf "Reduce compiler ability to optimise to statisfy gcc 9.5 (#1442)

gcc 9.5 has a bug https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95189 that has not been backported. Essentially, the compiler will falsely reason that it's comparing a string and optimise out everything behind a null-character. Dropping static const removes optimisation options for the compiler. In my tests, gcc 9.5 now emits a direct memcmp instead of attempting any optimisations.

Add X509_STORE_get1_objects

This will be needed for https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114573.
Along the way, document the various functions that expose \"query from
X509_STORE\". Most of them unfortunately leak the weird caching thing
that hash_dir does, as well as OpenSSL's generally poor handling of
issuers with the same name and CRL lookup, but I don't think it's really
worth trying to unexport these APIs.

gh-114572: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs (GH-114573)

* gh-114572: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224 for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

* Add missing X509_STORE_get1_objects failure check

A defect was discovered in the Python “ssl” module where there is a memory
race condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods “cert\_store\_stats()” and
“get\_ca\_certs()”. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are
called at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext,
such as during the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured.
This issue is fixed in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.

Severity: Low

* [gh-114572](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572): Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
[openssl/openssl#23224](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224) for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

* Add missing X509_STORE_get1_objects failure check

* Add blurb
