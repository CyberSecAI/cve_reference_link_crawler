Subject: 	[Security-announce][CVE-2024-0397] Memory race condition in
ssl.SSLContext certificate store methods

A defect was discovered in the Python “ssl” module where there is a memory race
condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods “cert_store_stats()” and
“get_ca_certs()”. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are called
at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext, such as during
the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured. This issue is fixed
in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.

Severity: Low
