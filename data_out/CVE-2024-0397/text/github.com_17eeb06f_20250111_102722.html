[gh-114572](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572): Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs ([GH-114573](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114573))

* [gh-114572](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572): Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
[openssl/openssl#23224](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224) for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

* Add missing X509_STORE_get1_objects failure check

* Add blurb
(cherry picked from commit [bce6931](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab))
