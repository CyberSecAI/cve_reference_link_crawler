### @davidben **[davidben](/davidben)** commented [Jan 25, 2024](#issue-2101304587) • edited by bedevere-app bot Loading

cert\_store\_stats and get\_ca\_certs query the SSLContext's X509\_STORE with X509\_STORE\_get0\_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See [openssl/openssl#23224](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224) for details.

Instead, use X509\_STORE\_get1\_objects, newly added in that PR. X509\_STORE\_get1\_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can polyfill it with X509\_STORE\_lock and X509\_STORE\_unlock.

Thanks for submitting this David!

This change feels newsworthy, can we get a news entry for this change using [blurb](https://devguide.python.org/core-developers/committing/#how-to-add-a-news-entry)?

I've reviewed the approach and I'm happy with it but will need a core developers' review before it can be merged.

Sorry, something went wrong.

From looking at all the OpenSSL docs this appears to be correct? I'm less versed with the OpenSSL API than the submitter :)

This will be needed for https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114573.
Along the way, document the various functions that expose \"query from

that hash_dir does, as well as OpenSSL's generally poor handling of
issuers with the same name and CRL lookup, but I don't think it's really
worth trying to unexport these APIs.

| ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Buildbot failure ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Hi! The buildbot **x86-64 MacOS Intel ASAN NoGIL 3.x** has failed when building commit [bce6931](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab).  What do you need to do:   1. Don't panic. 2. Check [the buildbot page in the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/buildbots/) if you don't know what the buildbots are or how they work. 3. Go to the page of the buildbot that failed (<https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/1366/builds/282>) and take a look at the build logs. 4. Check if the failure is related to this commit ([bce6931](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab)) or if it is a false positive. 5. If the failure is related to this commit, please, reflect that on the issue and make a new Pull Request with a fix.   You can take a look at the buildbot page here:  <https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/1366/builds/282>  Failed tests:   * test\_interpreters   Summary of the results of the build (if available):  ==  Click to see traceback logs ``` remote: Enumerating objects: 9, done.         remote: Counting objects:  16% (1/6)         remote: Counting objects:  33% (2/6)         remote: Counting objects:  50% (3/6)         remote: Counting objects:  66% (4/6)         remote: Counting objects:  83% (5/6)         remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6)         remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.         remote: Compressing objects:  16% (1/6)         remote: Compressing objects:  33% (2/6)         remote: Compressing objects:  50% (3/6)         remote: Compressing objects:  66% (4/6)         remote: Compressing objects:  83% (5/6)         remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6)         remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.         remote: Total 9 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 3         From https://github.com/python/cpython  * branch                  main       -> FETCH_HEAD Note: switching to 'bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab'.  You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.  If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command.

* gh-114572: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224 for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.

* Work around const-correctness problem

* Add missing X509_STORE_get1_objects failure check

* Add blurb

`[Reduce compiler ability to optimise to statisfy gcc 9.5 (](/WillChilds-Klein/aws-lc/commit/daf5bc9ce1f43a4447a9df1164b2a0c083bdbebf "Reduce compiler ability to optimise to statisfy gcc 9.5 (#1442)

gcc 9.5 has a bug https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95189 that has not been backported. Essentially, the compiler will falsely reason that it's comparing a string and optimise out everything behind a null-character. Dropping static const removes optimisation options for the compiler. In my tests, gcc 9.5 now emits a direct memcmp instead of attempting any optimisations.

Add X509_STORE_get1_objects

This will be needed for https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114573.
Along the way, document the various functions that expose \"query from
X509_STORE\". Most of them unfortunately leak the weird caching thing
that hash_dir does, as well as OpenSSL's generally poor handling of
issuers with the same name and CRL lookup, but I don't think it's really
worth trying to unexport these APIs.

gh-114572: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs (GH-114573)

* gh-114572: Fix locking in cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs

cert_store_stats and get_ca_certs query the SSLContext's X509_STORE with
X509_STORE_get0_objects, but reading the result requires a lock. See
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23224 for details.

Instead, use X509_STORE_get1_objects, newly added in that PR.
X509_STORE_get1_objects does not exist in current OpenSSLs, but we can
polyfill it with X509_STORE_lock and X509_STORE_unlock.
