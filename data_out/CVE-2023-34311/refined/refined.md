- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it is dereferenced as a pointer when parsing CO files in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to lure a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (CO file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can remotely exploit the vulnerability if they can trick the user into opening a crafted CO file or visiting a malicious website. User interaction is required.
