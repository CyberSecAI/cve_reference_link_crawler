Subject: CVE-2024-25142: Apache Airflow: Cache Control - Storage of
 Sensitive Data in Browser Cache

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.9.2

Description:

Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information vulnerability in Apache Airflow.

Airflow did not return "Cache-Control" header for dynamic content, which in case of some browsers could result in potentially storing sensitive data in local cache of the browser.

This issue affects Apache Airflow: before 2.9.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.9.2, which fixes the issue.

This one prevents accidental storing of dynamic content containing potentially sensitive data in cache. The way we implemented it, we check if the response already contains "Cache-Control" - if it does then it means that this is a static content with default cache control set by SEND\_FILE\_MAX\_AGE\_DEFAULT setting (43200 by default).

`[Add Cache-Control "no-store" to all dynamically generated content (](/apache/airflow/commit/0920ae90eafbdb8c09f6ef7e2f0a1a520fee1e08 "Add Cache-Control \"no-store\" to all dynamically generated content (#39550)

This one prevents accidental storing of dynamic content containing
potentially sensitive data in cache. The way we implemented it, we
check if the response already contains \"Cache-Control\" - if it does
then it means that this is a static content with default cache
control set by SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT setting (43200 by default).

(cherry picked from commit 94eb647de692a4d9555b02dce85974da5d4c04e3)")[#3…](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39550)`
