# Possible ReDoS vulnerability in HTTP Token authentication in Action Controller

Low

[jhawthorn](/jhawthorn)
published
GHSA-vfg9-r3fq-jvx4
Oct 15, 2024

## Package

bundler

actionpack
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 4.0.0, < 6.1.7.9
>= 7.0.0, < 7.0.8.5
>= 7.1.0, < 7.1.4.1
>= 7.2.0, < 7.2.1.1

## Patched versions

6.1.7.9
7.0.8.5
7.1.4.1
7.2.1.1

## Description

There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in Action Controller's HTTP Token authentication. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-47887](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfg9-r3fq-jvx4 "CVE-2024-47887").

## Impact

For applications using HTTP Token authentication via `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or similar, a carefully crafted header may cause header parsing to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.

Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.

## Releases

The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

## Workarounds

Users on Ruby 3.2 are unaffected by this issue.

## Credits

Thanks to [scyoon](https://hackerone.com/scyoon) for reporting
