{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Action Controller's HTTP Token authentication parses headers. Specifically, the `raw_params` method uses a regular expression to split key-value pairs in the authorization header, which can be exploited to cause a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "ReDoS vulnerability due to inefficient regular expression used in `raw_params` method for parsing HTTP Token authentication headers."
    ],
    "impact": "A carefully crafted authorization header can cause the parsing to take an excessive amount of time, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "Attacker sends a malicious HTTP request with a crafted authorization header.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
