Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Academy LMS plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically, one with "Academy Instructor" privileges) can perform actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located within the WordPress plugin.
- Attackers can exploit it through the plugin's functionality, specifically functions that lack proper authorization checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an "Academy Instructor" role in the WordPress installation.
- They don't need any special privileges beyond that, but also don't have to be unauthenticated.
