The heap use after free are resolved by the commits below.

If fz_new_pixmap_with_bbox() threw conv would be NULL and temp would     be pointing to a pixmap that would be dropped 2 times.          If fz_clone_pixmap_area_with_different_seps() threw temp and conv     would be pointing to the same pixmap that would be dropped 3 times.  commit [83d4dae44c71816c084a635550acc1a51529b881](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?83d4dae44c71816c084a635550acc1a51529b881) Author: Sebastian Rasmussen <sebras@gmail.com> Date:   Tue Jan 23 16:43:59 2018 +0100      [Bug 698904](show_bug.cgi?id=698904 "RESOLVED FIXED - oss-fuzz 5609: Claimed use-of-uninitialized value in fz_drop_hash_table()"): Upon error both free color converter and clear its pointer.          Without this change future calls to fz_fin_cached_color_converter()     will try to dereference the already freed pointer. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=698901#c3)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2018-02-02 16:33:58 UTC  ``` I have a tentative patch awaiting review in commit [511e8b02a93fb9371ceed38582631fbded1edf34](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?511e8b02a93fb9371ceed38582631fbded1edf34). ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=698901#c4)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2018-03-01 22:35:02 UTC  ``` This was fixed in  commit [f51836b9732c38d945b87fda0770009a77ba680c](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?f51836b9732c38d945b87fda0770009a77ba680c) Author: Sebastian Rasmussen <sebras@gmail.com> Date:   Fri Feb 2 21:45:49 2018 +0100      [Bug 698901](show_bug.cgi?id=698901 "RESOLVED FIXED - oss-fuzz 5604: Claimed heap-use-after-free in fz_fin_cached_color_converter()"): Drop pixmaps/knockout group upon error when ending group.          Previously the call to fz_convert_pixmap() threw causing a destination     pixmap leak. This illustrated a bigger issue with the error handling     so now all types of pixmaps are dropped and care is taken to also end     the knockout group, should there be any. ``` |  |
