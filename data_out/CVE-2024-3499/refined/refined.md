Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3499

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper control of the filename used in an include/require statement within the `generate_navigation_markup` function of the Onepage Scroll module. Specifically, the code was directly including a file based on user input (`$nav_style`) without sufficient sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. By manipulating the `$nav_style` parameter, an attacker can force the application to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The plugin directly uses user-provided input (`$nav_style`) in a file inclusion statement, without proper validation or sanitization. This lack of security control allows for the LFI vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** By including and executing arbitrary files, attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows them to execute any PHP code within the included files.
*   **Bypass Access Controls:** Successful exploitation can bypass access controls, potentially allowing attackers to access sensitive data or perform actions they would not normally be authorized to do.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** In cases where arbitrary files can be included, attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored on the server's file system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is network-based, allowing remote exploitation by sending specially crafted requests.
*   **Authenticated Attack:** This vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated as a Contributor or higher-level user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account with at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge:** Basic understanding of web request manipulation and LFI principles.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located within the `generate_navigation_markup` function of the Onepage Scroll module.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.1.1 of the plugin. The fix involves sanitizing the `$nav_style` variable before using it in the include statement.
*   The vulnerable versions are all versions of the ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin up to and including 3.1.0.
* The fix was implemented by adding a check to see if the `$nav_style` variable exists in a pre-defined array of allowed values.
