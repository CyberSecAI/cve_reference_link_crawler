- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the CLI service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attacker can exploit this vulnerability via the CLI service which listens on TCP port 23.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network segment and be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
