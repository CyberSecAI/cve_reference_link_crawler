A vulnerability in the VPN web client services feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a browser that is accessing an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to application endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link designed to submit malicious input to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or script code in the browser in the context of the web services page.
