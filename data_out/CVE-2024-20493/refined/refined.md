- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Ineffective handling of memory resources during the authentication process of the Remote Access SSL VPN feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Resource exhaustion due to crafted packets causing the authentication process to use excessive memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can deny authentication for Remote Access SSL VPN users for several minutes, resulting in a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted packets to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated, remote attacker.
