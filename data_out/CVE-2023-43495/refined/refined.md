Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-43495:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ExpandableDetailsNote` feature in Jenkins does not properly escape the value of the `caption` constructor parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the build log that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the build log. This can result in the attacker stealing session cookies, redirecting the victim to a malicious site or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker must be able to provide a malicious value to the `caption` parameter of the `ExpandableDetailsNote`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a value to the `caption` parameter. This likely means the attacker would need some form of write access or control over the build process or the log annotation process. The attacker also needs to have "Item/Read" permission to view the build logs.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information also mentions that the related API is not used within Jenkins core, and the security team is not aware of any affected plugins, indicating that the vulnerability might not be widely exploitable or might require specific conditions to exist to be exploited.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Jenkins version 2.424 and LTS 2.414.2, which now escapes the `caption` constructor parameter values.
