The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in FrogCMS version 0.9.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability in the `/admin/?/layout/delete/1` endpoint.
- Lack of CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to validate the origin of the requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions, such as deleting layouts.
- Potential data loss or unauthorized modification of the CMS.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (as shown in the PoC) that, when loaded by a victim user, sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Victim user must be logged into FrogCMS for the attack to be successful.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host and serve malicious HTML content.
- The attacker needs the victim to be logged into the FrogCMS application.
- Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints, in this case `/admin/?/layout/delete/1`.
