{
  "CVE-2019-2818": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that the ChaCha20Cipher implementation in OpenJDK did not use constant time computations in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
    "Root cause": "Non-constant time computations in the ChaCha20Cipher implementation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of sensitive information",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
       "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable ChaCha20Cipher implementation. Specific details not provided."
