##### Other LuxSoft Applications

To keep our programming knowledge cutting edge, we used spare moments, or
moments when working on the LuxCal calendar became too obsessive, to produce
some high quality small applications, using a minimum of code:

* LuxFile: A light-weight server file viewer application, which you can find
  in the Gems menu, or by clicking

  which you can also find in the Gems menu, or by clicking

  browser. See the Gems menu, or click
