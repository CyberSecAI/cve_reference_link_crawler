| Hi community! I just found a possible security issue when reading the code. I would like to discuss whether it is a real vulnerability. Description The bug is that the DaemonSet `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` in the charts has too much RBAC permission than it needs, which may cause some security problems, and the worse one leads cluster being hijacked. The problem is that the `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` uses a sharing service account ([local-disk-manager.yaml#L17](https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor/blob/9634728d79084a6872c3b092cb1fe1f89b7f7999/helm/hwameistor/templates/local-disk-manager.yaml#L17)) instead of creating a separate one. This causes the `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` have the following sensitive permissions:   * `create/update/patch/delete` verb of `deployments/statefulsets/daemonsets/cronjobs/replicasets/job` resource (ClusterRole) * `get/list` verb of `secrets` resource (ClusterRole) * `update/patch` verb of `nodes` resource (ClusterRole)   After reading the source code of [hwameistor-local-disk-manager](https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor), I didn't find any Kubernetes API usages using these permissions. However, these unused permissions may have some potential risks:   * `create/update/patch/delete` verb of `deployments/statefulsets/daemonsets/cronjobs/replicasets/job` resource   + A malicious user can create a privileged container with a malicious container image capable of container escape. This would allow him/she gaining ROOT privilege of the worker node the created container deployed. Since the malicious user can control the pod scheduling parameters (e.g., replicas number, node affinity, …), he/she should be able to deploy the malicious container to every (or almost every) worker node. This means the malicious user will be able to control every (or almost every) worker node in the cluster. * `get/list` verb of `secrets` resource   + A malicious user can get/list all the secrets in the cluster (since this is declared in a ClusterRole), including database passwords, tokens of external cloud servers, etc. Even worse, if the cluster admin's token is stored in the cluster secret, he/she can use it to make a cluster-level privilege escalation. This means the malicious user will be able to hijack the whole cluster. * `update/patch` verb of `nodes` resource   + This permission allows malicious users to patch all nodes in the cluster, e.g., changing their pod taints. This could help the first attack to allocate malicious containers. Also, this allows the attacker to hijack some pods with high RBAC permissions to attacker-controlled nodes.   The malicious users only need to get the service account token to perform the above attacks. There are several ways have already been reported in the real world to achieve this:   * Supply chain attacks: Like the xz backdoor in the recent. The attacker only needs to read `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`. * RCE vulnerability in the APP: Any remote-code-execution vulnerability that can read local files can achieve this. * Control one worker node: Since `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` is a DaemonSet, it will be deployed on every worker node in the cluster. Any attacker who controls one worker node can further control the whole cluster with these permissions.  Mitigation Suggestion  * Create a separate service account and remove all the unnecessary permissions * Specify the resource names in the role rules if it can be determined. For example, list all the secret names the APP needs to read. However, it may need a careful review of the source code to identify all the secrets needed exactly. * Write Kyverno or OPA/Gatekeeper policy to:   + Limit the container image, entrypoint and commands of newly created pods. This would effectively avoid the creation of malicious containers.   + Restrict the `securityContext` of newly created pods, especially enforcing the `securityContext.privileged` and `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` to `false`. This would prevent the attacker from escaping the malicious container. In old Kubernetes versions, `PodSecurityPolicy` can also be used to achive this (it is deprecated in v1.21).  Few Questions  * Are these permissions really unused for hwameistor-local-disk-manager? * Would these mitigation suggestions be applicable for the hwameistor?
