v0.14.6

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

This ClusterRole has \* verbs of \* resources. If a malicious user can access the worker node which has hwameistor's deployment, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

> = v0.14.6

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Update and Limit the ClusterRole using [security-role](https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor/blob/main/helm/hwameistor/templates/clusterrole.yaml).

### **[HouqiyuA](/HouqiyuA)** commented [Apr 29, 2024](#issue-2268367950)

| Dear Team Members:  Greetings! Our team is very interested in your project and we recently identified a potential RBAC security risk while doing a security assessment of your project. Therefore, we would like to report it to you and provide you with the relevant details so that you can fix and improve it accordingly. I couldn't find a private email to report security risks, so I raised this issue. If there is anything inappropriate about it, I hope you can forgive me. Details:  I found that the project has a cluster role named hwameistor-role and that hwameistor-role has been granted [\*] \*.(<https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor/blob/main/helm/hwameistor/templates/clusterrole.yaml>) This means that he can perform any operations on all resources in the cluster. I believe that granting such privileges is excessive, does not comply with the principle of least privilege, and is a potential vulnerability. An attacker could impersonate the service account bound to this ClusterRole and use its high-risk privileges to list confidential information across the cluster. By combining the permissions of other roles, an attacker could elevate the privileges and further take over the entire cluster.  we constructed the following attack vectors.  First, you need to get a token for the ServiceAccount that has this high-risk privilege. If you are already in a Pod and have this override, you can directly run the following command to get the token: cat /var/run/secrets/[[kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/](http://kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/)](<http://kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/>) token. If you are on a node other than a Pod, you can run the following command to get the kubectl describe secret .  Use the obtained token information to authenticate with the API server. By including the token in the request, you can be recognized as a legitimate user with a ServiceAccount and gain all privileges associated with the ServiceAccount. As a result, this ServiceAccount identity can be used to list all secrets in the cluster.  We give two ways to further utilize ServiceAccount Token with other privileges to take over the cluster:  Method 1: Elevation of Privilege by Utilizing ServiceAccount Token Bound to ClusterAdmin  Directly use a Token with the ClusterAdmin role permissions that has the authority to control the entire cluster. By authenticating with this token, you can gain full control of the cluster.  Method 2: Create Privileged Containers with ServiceAccount Token with create pods permission You can use this ServiceAccount Token to create a privileged container that mounts the root directory and schedules it to the master node in a taint-tolerant way, so that you can access and leak the master node's kubeconfig configuration file. In this way you can take over the entire cluster.  For the above attack chain we have developed exploit code and uploaded it to github: <https://github.com/HouqiyuA/k8s-rbac-poc> Mitigation methods are explored:  Carefully evaluate the permissions required for each user or service account to ensure that it is following the principle of least privilege and to avoid over-authorization.  If list secrets is a required permission, consider using more granular RBAC rules. Role Binding can be used to grant list secrets permissions instead of ClusterRole, which restricts permissions to specific namespaces or resources rather than the entire cluster.  Isolate different applications into different namespaces and use namespace-level RBAC rules to restrict access. This reduces the risk of privilege leakage across namespaces  Looking forward to hearing from you and discussing this risk in more detail with us, thank you very much for your time and attention.  Best wishes.  HouqiyuA |

| [@HouqiyuA](https://github.com/HouqiyuA) Thanks for your feedback.  Indeed, this account could cause some issues. We will refine the granularity of the permission control in this part.  May I ask, how did you discover this problem? Was it by conducting batch scanning through scripts, or is it because you have some requirements for this project and are currently using it? |

| Hi community! I just found a possible security issue when reading the code. I would like to discuss whether it is a real vulnerability. Description The bug is that the DaemonSet `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` in the charts has too much RBAC permission than it needs, which may cause some security problems, and the worse one leads cluster being hijacked. The problem is that the `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` uses a sharing service account ([local-disk-manager.yaml#L17](https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor/blob/9634728d79084a6872c3b092cb1fe1f89b7f7999/helm/hwameistor/templates/local-disk-manager.yaml#L17)) instead of creating a separate one. This causes the `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` have the following sensitive permissions:   * `create/update/patch/delete` verb of `deployments/statefulsets/daemonsets/cronjobs/replicasets/job` resource (ClusterRole) * `get/list` verb of `secrets` resource (ClusterRole) * `update/patch` verb of `nodes` resource (ClusterRole)   After reading the source code of [hwameistor-local-disk-manager](https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor), I didn't find any Kubernetes API usages using these permissions. However, these unused permissions may have some potential risks:   * `create/update/patch/delete` verb of `deployments/statefulsets/daemonsets/cronjobs/replicasets/job` resource   + A malicious user can create a privileged container with a malicious container image capable of container escape. This would allow him/she gaining ROOT privilege of the worker node the created container deployed. Since the malicious user can control the pod scheduling parameters (e.g., replicas number, node affinity, …), he/she should be able to deploy the malicious container to every (or almost every) worker node. This means the malicious user will be able to control every (or almost every) worker node in the cluster. * `get/list` verb of `secrets` resource   + A malicious user can get/list all the secrets in the cluster (since this is declared in a ClusterRole), including database passwords, tokens of external cloud servers, etc. Even worse, if the cluster admin's token is stored in the cluster secret, he/she can use it to make a cluster-level privilege escalation. This means the malicious user will be able to hijack the whole cluster. * `update/patch` verb of `nodes` resource   + This permission allows malicious users to patch all nodes in the cluster, e.g., changing their pod taints. This could help the first attack to allocate malicious containers. Also, this allows the attacker to hijack some pods with high RBAC permissions to attacker-controlled nodes.   The malicious users only need to get the service account token to perform the above attacks. There are several ways have already been reported in the real world to achieve this:   * Supply chain attacks: Like the xz backdoor in the recent. The attacker only needs to read `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`. * RCE vulnerability in the APP: Any remote-code-execution vulnerability that can read local files can achieve this. * Control one worker node: Since `hwameistor-local-disk-manager` is a DaemonSet, it will be deployed on every worker node in the cluster. Any attacker who controls one worker node can further control the whole cluster with these permissions.  Mitigation Suggestion  * Create a separate service account and remove all the unnecessary permissions * Specify the resource names in the role rules if it can be determined. For example, list all the secret names the APP needs to read. However, it may need a careful review of the source code to identify all the secrets needed exactly. * Write Kyverno or OPA/Gatekeeper policy to:   + Limit the container image, entrypoint and commands of newly created pods. This would effectively avoid the creation of malicious containers.   + Restrict the `securityContext` of newly created pods, especially enforcing the `securityContext.privileged` and `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` to `false`. This would prevent the attacker from escaping the malicious container. In old Kubernetes versions, `PodSecurityPolicy` can also be used to achive this (it is deprecated in v1.21).  Few Questions  * Are these permissions really unused for hwameistor-local-disk-manager? * Would these mitigation suggestions be applicable for the hwameistor?
