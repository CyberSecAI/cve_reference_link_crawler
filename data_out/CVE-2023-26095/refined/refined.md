- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Stormshield Network Security (SNS) is vulnerable to a crash when performing Network Address Translation (NAT) on a specially crafted Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way SNS handles and processes malformed SIP packets during NAT operations, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation results in a denial of service (DoS) condition, causing the SNS device to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can send the malicious SIP packets over the network to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction and can exploit this vulnerability from a remote network position.
