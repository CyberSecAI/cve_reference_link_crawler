  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of hardcoded cryptographic keys.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated, remote attacker with admin privileges can read hardcoded cryptographic keys, potentially allowing the attacker to create valid session cookies. However, these session cookies are not sufficient to obtain a valid session on the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker exploits the vulnerability via a network attack.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges on the affected device."
