Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the absence of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token protection in Plesk Obsidian 18.0.37.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The application does not implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms. Specifically, it does not include CSRF tokens in requests, which are needed to verify the legitimacy of the request origin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can craft malicious HTML pages or links that, when opened by a logged-in Plesk user, will trigger unauthorized actions on the Plesk server. This could lead to submitting requests with attacker-controlled data, potentially leading to various security issues.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in Plesk user to load an attacker-controlled HTML page or click a malicious link. This can be done through various means such as sending an email, injecting the malicious code on a web page the victim visits, or other social engineering tactics.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in Plesk user to interact with attacker-controlled content (e.g., a malicious link or HTML page). The attacker doesn't necessarily need direct access to the Plesk server. The attack leverages the victim's active session to perform actions on the server on their behalf.

**Summary**
This is a CSRF vulnerability in Plesk Obsidian 18.0.37 due to missing CSRF token protection. An attacker can submit malicious requests by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a link or opening a crafted HTML page.
