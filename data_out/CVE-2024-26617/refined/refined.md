The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26617.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the Linux kernel's memory management unit (MMU) notifier mechanism. The MMU notifier was being called outside of the mm lock, leading to potential race conditions with other components that depend on it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition: The MMU notifier was not protected by the mm lock which could lead to inconsistent memory state if another component tries to change the memory mapping at the same time.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The race condition could lead to memory corruption, system instability, or potentially other undefined behaviors. In the specific case reported, it was observed as a warning in the KVM subsystem (`kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte`).

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by any operation that uses the pagemap scan functionality with `PM_SCAN_WP_MATCHING` flag set which can trigger the mmu notifier. An attacker could potentially trigger this via a crafted application that uses the relevant syscalls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to invoke the `pagemap_scan` functionality which is typically available through the `/proc/<pid>/pagemap` interface which requires local access and sufficient privileges to open and ioctl to the file.
