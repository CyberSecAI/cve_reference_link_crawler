  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UsersWP plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided data when generating CSV files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSV Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could craft malicious formulas within the exported CSV data. When opened in spreadsheet software, these formulas can be executed, leading to potential vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software or execution of arbitrary commands on the victim's PC.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious user injects malicious CSV formula into data handled by the plugin. The plugin then exports this data in a CSV file, which when opened can execute the malicious payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a subscriber on the vulnerable WordPress site, allowing them to manipulate data that is later exported in CSV format."
