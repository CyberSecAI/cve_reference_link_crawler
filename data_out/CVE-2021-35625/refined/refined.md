Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35625:

**1. Verification:**

The content from both oracle.com and security.netapp.com directly mentions CVE-2021-35625. The oracle.com document is a Critical Patch Update Advisory that lists the CVE as affecting "MySQL Server". The security.netapp.com advisory lists this CVE and states it affects NetApp products using MySQL.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a vulnerability within the MySQL Server's handling of "Security: Privileges", as described in the Oracle document. The specifics of the vulnerability are not provided beyond this general description. The vulnerability in NetApp products arises from the affected MySQL versions used in their products.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The weakness lies in how MySQL Server handles security privileges.
- The Oracle document indicates this affects MySQL Server versions prior to 8.0.26.
- NetApp's advisory indicates their products utilizing affected versions are vulnerable.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- According to oracle.com, successful exploitation could lead to "unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server."
-  NetApp also states, "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server."
- The CVSS score from the netapp document indicates low confidentiality impact.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is described as “Network” in oracle.com's risk matrix. This implies exploitation over the network.
- NetApp's advisory does not specify the specific vector.
- The NetApp's advisory indicates that the vulnerabilities within their products are via their products affected by the MySQL vulnerabilities.
- The privilege requirement according to both advisories is high, meaning the attacker needs elevated access within the MySQL instance or server.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need network access to the vulnerable MySQL server or the affected NetApp products.
- The attacker would likely require some level of privileges (user account) on the MySQL server to exploit the vulnerability related to privilege handling, as specified in both advisories.

**Additional Notes:**
- Both documents indicate this vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication meaning the attacker needs a valid user within the affected MySQL instance.
- The NetApp document indicates they are not responsible for "any errors or omissions" in the document or claims no legal obligation.

In summary, CVE-2021-35625 is a vulnerability in MySQL Server's privilege handling that can be exploited via the network. An attacker with high privileges can potentially cause a denial of service or unauthorized access to or modification of data. NetApp products using vulnerable versions of MySQL Server are also affected.
