|  | Disclaimer: It is important to note that a previous vulnerability related to DoS attacks on asyncua servers exists. |
| --- | --- |
|  | However, the vulnerability described here is entirely different in nature. The previous vulnerability relied on |
|  | resource exhaustion by sending an unlimited number of large chunks. |
|  | This crafted message is sufficient to cause the server to enter an infinite loop, |
|  | gradually consuming more and more resources. Notably, |
|  | in comparison to CVE-2022-25304, the vulnerability discussed in this gist requires less effort to exploi |
|  |  |
|  | #How was the vulnerability discovered ? |
|  | During my experiments for my Ph.D., I identified this vulnerability and promptly alerted the maintainers |
|  | by creating an issue on Git, as their request. |
|  |  |
|  | #Reproduce: |
|  | To reproduce this vulnerability: |
|  | 0/send a message with a size field set to 0. |
|  | I used an open secure channel request but others are working. |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | All of this is described in the issue: |
|  | The first comment made a mistake by thinking that this vulnerability is CVE-2022-25304. But if you read the complete issue |
|  | you will see that it is not. |
