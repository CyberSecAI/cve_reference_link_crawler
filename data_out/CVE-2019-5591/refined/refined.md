- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiOS default configuration does not verify the LDAP server's identity, allowing an attacker to impersonate the LDAP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Default configuration vulnerability where the FortiOS does not verify LDAP server identity.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet can intercept sensitive information by impersonating the LDAP server. This results in information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker on the same subnet as the FortiOS device can impersonate the LDAP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same subnet as the vulnerable FortiOS device and be able to act as a malicious LDAP server.
