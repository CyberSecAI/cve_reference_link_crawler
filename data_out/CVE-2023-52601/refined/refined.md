  "cveId": "CVE-2023-52601",
  "description": "The provided data indicates that CVE-2023-52601 is related to an array-index-out-of-bounds vulnerability in the jfs (Journaled File System) driver of the Linux kernel.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "A missing bounds check in the `dbAdjTree` function when accessing the `dmt_stree` array within the jfs driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Array-index-out-of-bounds vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a crash or other undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "attackVectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through operations on a JFS filesystem that cause the `dbAdjTree` function to be called with an invalid `leafno` value, leading to an out-of-bounds array access within the `dmt_stree`.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path in `dbAdjTree`. This usually requires the ability to mount/interact with a JFS filesystem and performing specific operations related to block allocation and deallocation. The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user with sufficient privileges to trigger the code or by an attacker with the ability to control file operations on a JFS filesystem."
  },
  "additionalNotes": "The fix involves adding a bounds check and using a `is_ctl` boolean flag to determine the correct size of the `dmt_stree` array. The advisory states that it is resolved in kernel versions 5.10.216-1~deb10u1 and 4.19.316-1 for Debian 10 buster. The fix is also backported to older versions of Linux kernel."
