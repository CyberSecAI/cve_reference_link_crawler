The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25156.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of a weak hash algorithm for password storage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a weak hash (CWE-328)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to potentially log into the affected product by reversing an eavesdropped password hash. This can lead to unauthorized access to the product's functionalities and data.
-  Potential disclosure of sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack over a network.
- Requires capturing network traffic to obtain the password hash
- Then, offline, the captured hash is reversed

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the affected device.
- Ability to eavesdrop network traffic and capture the password hash.
- Capability to reverse a weak hash.
