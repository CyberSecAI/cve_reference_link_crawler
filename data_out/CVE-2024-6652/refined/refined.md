Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6652 (Note: While this is not explicitly stated, the content matches the description format of a CVE related entry for a SQL injection vulnerability).

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the "id" parameter in the `manage_member.php` file of the "Gym Management System Project In PHP With Source Code".
*   The "id" parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically in the `manage_member.php` file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied "id" parameter before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** They can modify or delete data stored in the database.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive information without proper authorization.
*   **Comprehensive System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain control over the system.
*   **Service Interruption:** The vulnerability could be exploited to cause a disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the "id" parameter in the `manage_member.php` file.
*   Attackers inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user, indicating that the application does not validate user roles or permissions before processing requests.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a request containing the crafted malicious SQL payload through the "id" parameter of the `manage_member.php` file.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using time-based blind, boolean-based blind, error-based, and UNION query SQL injection techniques.
*   The provided `sqlmap` command shows how an attacker can enumerate databases using the vulnerability.
*   The report provides suggested repair including using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database permissions, and regular security audits.
