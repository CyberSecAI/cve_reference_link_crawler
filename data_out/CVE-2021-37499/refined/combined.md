## RLM and RLM Activation Pro

What’s the difference?

![](http://reprisesoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/lockv7-2-e1712846771550-1.png)

## Reprise License Manager (RLM)

Software License Manager

RLM provides runtime checking that verifies that your application is licensed to run and that the current usage of your application is within the limits you have ser every time your application runs.

As a Software publisher, you integrate RLM into your product, and RLM keeps track at runtime of who is using the licenses of your software.

RLM can do this entirely within the client library (linked into your application), or, more commonly, your application makes a request of the RLM Lincese Server to check out a license.

The lincese server runs either on your customers network, or in the cloud if you are using our RLMCloud™ service.

RLM provides runtime checking that verifies that your application is licensed to run and that the current usage of your application is within the limits you have ser every time your application runs.

![](http://reprisesoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/key3-1-e1715352489801.png)

## RLM Activation Pro

Software Activation Manager

Activation Pro is
used once when your customer purchases your software in order to retrieve the license which is specific to that customer.

Software Activation’s purpose in life is to get the licenses for your product to your customers with a minimum of fuss.

Activation Pro also has a server component wich we call the activation server.

Your application contacts the activation server and supplies a short text activation key, and in exchange, the activation server returns the license which enables your product.

Generally, this is done once, right after your customer purchases your software, not every time your software is invoked.

The Problem

## Presales can't run every demo

Solutions Engineers (SEs) don’t have time to join every sales call — but too often Account Executives (AEs) don’t have the tools to run their own demos either.

The result?

* SEs help with every product demo, including early-stage, unqualified opps
* Presales builds and maintains expensive demo tenants
* Sales uses a live app for risky, inconsistent demos

![](https://www.reprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/problem-comp2.png)

The Solution

## Get fully interactive, reliable demo environments

No more adding SEs to every product demo.

![](https://www.reprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/solution-comp2.png)

##### Win More Deals With Better Demos

[Get a Demo](/demo)

The Reprise Difference

### Only Reprise supports all 3 ways of doing live sales demos

![graphic of a Guided Demo](https://www.reprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3-ways-guided.png)

#### On a guided demo

Capture your product’s frontend look and feel. Good for foolproof demos, tours, & leave-behinds.

![a graphics of a demo over a live app](https://www.reprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3-ways-live.png)

#### On your live app

Inject AI [demo data](https://www.reprise.com/platform/data-studio) into your production environment. Good for custom, “go anywhere” sales demos.

![a graphic of a demo of a clone of your app](https://www.reprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3-ways-clone.png)

#### On an application clone

Recreate your product at the code level. Good for live sales demos that need to be fully interactive, reliable, & repeatable.

Why Reprise?

### Close more deals with high-quality product demos tailored for every sales scenario

#### Flawless demos, every time

Reprise demo software captures your product and seamlessly recreates it in a self-contained [demo environment](https://www.reprise.com/solutions/sandbox-environments).

Thousands of sales reps can use it simultaneously. It always loads fast (even offline). And it’s fully interactive so your product looks and feels like the real thing. With better demos at every stage, you close more deals faster.

![easy-peasy demos](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8...)

![Customize anything](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8...)

#### Unlimited customization

Inject custom datasets to fill an empty demo environment or tailor it to a specific vertical.

Customize everything — down to the code level — to get complete control over your graphs and charts. Telling the right story to the right audience leads to faster sales cycles.

#### Effortless demo maintenance

Reprise hosts your demo environment, meaning SEs don’t have to maintain, reset, or deal with exorbitant cloud costs.

With SEs doing higher value work — like supporting POCs and building custom solutions — you increase win rates and eliminate wasted time and resources.
