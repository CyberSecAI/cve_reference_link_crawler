Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-37499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "password" parameter within the "View License" function of the Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface. Specifically, the application fails to prevent the insertion of Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) sequences into HTTP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CRLF Injection:** The core vulnerability is a CRLF injection flaw. This allows an attacker to insert CRLF characters (%0d%0a or \r\n) into HTTP headers. This is achieved through the vulnerable "password" parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTTP Header Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the server's response.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Injecting arbitrary headers can have several consequences, which might include:
    *   **HTTP Response Splitting:** Manipulating the HTTP response by injecting headers could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or cache poisoning, depending on the application and context.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Although not explicitly mentioned, session fixation could be another impact if an attacker is able to inject a session ID via a "Set-Cookie" header. This depends if the application has any vulnerabilities for this.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the RLM web interface.
*   **"password" Parameter:** Specifically the password parameter within the "View License" function.
*   **CRLF Character Insertion:** Injecting CRLF sequences (%0d%0a or \r\n).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable RLM web interface.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the RLM application to access the "View License" function
*   **Understanding HTTP:** Basic knowledge of HTTP headers and how CRLF injection works is needed to craft a successful attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Product:** Reprise License Manager through version 14.2BL4 is affected.
*   The provided text provides more details than the basic CVE description which only specifies "CRLF Injection" with no additional information.

**In summary, CVE-2021-37499 describes a CRLF injection vulnerability in the RLM web interface that can be exploited by a remote, authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers which could then lead to other attacks.**
