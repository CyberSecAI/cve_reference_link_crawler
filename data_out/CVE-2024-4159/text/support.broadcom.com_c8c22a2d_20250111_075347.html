CVE-2024-4159

| **Brocade Security Advisory ID** | **BSA-2024-2573** |
| --- | --- |
| **Component** | **Docker** |
|  |  |

**Summary**

Brocade SANnav before v2.3.0a lacks protection mechanisms on port 2377/TCP and 7946/TCP, which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to sniff the SANnav Docker information.

**Products Affected**

Brocade SANnav before Brocade SANnav v2.3.0a

**Solution**

* A security update is released in Brocade SANnav v2.3.1  and v2.3.0a
* The Brocade SANnav v2.3.1 installation guide is updated with sample IPTABLE rules for a customer to create, selectively opening the ports for FOS switches and closing the rest. More information can be found at: <https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/pdf/fc-networking/software-sannav/sannav-231x-mp-install.pdf>
* Brocade SANnav versions prior to v2.3.0a can run the following steps:

**For IPv4**:
iptables -A SANNAV-CHAIN -s <source IP Address/subnet> -i <interface-to-block> -p <protocol> -m <protocol> --dport <port> -j ACCEPT

iptables -A SANNAV-CHAIN -i <interface-to-block> -p <protocol> -m <protocol> --dport <port> -j DROP

Examples:

iptables -A SANNAV-CHAIN -s x.x.x.x/32 -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 19094 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A SANNAV-CHAIN -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 19094 -j DROP

**For IPv6**:
ip6tables -A SANNAV-CHAIN -s <source IP Address/subnet> -i <interface-to-block> -p <protocol> -m <protocol> --dport <port> -j ACCEPT

ip6tables -A SANNAV-CHAIN -i <interface-to-block> -p <protocol> -m <protocol> --dport <port> -j DROP

Examples:

ip6tables -A SANNAV-CHAIN -s x.x.x.x/32 -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 19094 -j ACCEPT

ip6tables -A SANNAV-CHAIN -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 19094 -j DROP
