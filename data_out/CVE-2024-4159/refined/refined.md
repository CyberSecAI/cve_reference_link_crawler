- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Brocade SANnav before v2.3.0a lacks protection mechanisms on ports 2377/TCP and 7946/TCP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Missing access control on ports 2377/TCP and 7946/TCP. This allows unauthenticated access to the ports.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can sniff the SANnav Docker information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the vulnerable ports 2377/TCP and 7946/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable ports. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
