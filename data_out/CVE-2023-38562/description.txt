A double-free vulnerability exists in the IP header loopback parsing functionality of Weston Embedded uC-TCP-IP v3.06.01. A specially crafted set of network packets can lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of unauthenticated packets to trigger this vulnerability.
