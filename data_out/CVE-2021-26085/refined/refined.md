Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `/s/` endpoint of Atlassian Confluence Server, allowing for arbitrary file reads. The specific vulnerability is a "Pre-Authorization Arbitrary File Read," meaning that an attacker can exploit it without needing to authenticate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Pre-Authorization Arbitrary File Read:** The core vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server without prior authentication, accessing resources that should be restricted.
- **Insecure Endpoint:** The `/s/` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal or similar attacks, making it possible to read arbitrary files on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access potentially sensitive information from configuration files, source code, or other internal files on the Confluence server. This information could include credentials, internal IP addresses, or other confidential data that would allow further malicious activities.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The information gained could be used for further attacks, such as privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through making specially crafted HTTP requests to the `/s/` endpoint.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Confluence server.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or user credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability.
