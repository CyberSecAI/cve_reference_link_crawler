- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiDDoS API uses a hardcoded cryptographic key for signing JWT tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a hardcoded cryptographic key (CWE-321). This allows an attacker who obtains the key to sign JWT tokens for any device.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who retrieves the hardcoded key can sign JWT tokens, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control over FortiDDoS devices. This leads to improper access control.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to retrieve the hardcoded cryptographic key from a vulnerable FortiDDoS device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to extract the hardcoded key from a vulnerable FortiDDoS device.
