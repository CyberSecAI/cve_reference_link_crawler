# Insufficient content-type validation for uploaded files

High

[sergei-maertens](/sergei-maertens)
published
GHSA-h85r-xv4w-cg8g
Jun 13, 2022

## Package

open-forms
(open-formulieren)

## Affected versions

< 1.0.9, < 1.1.1

## Patched versions

1.0.9, 1.1.1

## Description

### Impact

Open Forms supports file uploads as one of the form field types. These fields can be configured to allow only certain file extensions to be uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input validation of uploaded files is insufficient in this case. Users could alter or strip file extensions to bypass this validation.

This results in files being uploaded to the server that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name extension. These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically) by staff and/or other applications for further processing. Malicious files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted networks.

### Patches

This will be patched in the `master` branch and subsequently released in `1.0.9` and `1.1.1`. You should upgrade to a supported version asap.

### Workarounds

An API gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of open-forms may be able to scan for and block malicious content before it reaches the Open Forms application.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31041
