{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses user-controlled input to construct URLs for requests to external services without proper validation or sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can make the server send requests to arbitrary destinations. This can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the streamlit-geospatial server can reach.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The application takes user input for a URL in the `pages/7_ðŸ“¦_Web_Map_Service.py` file, which is then used to make a request using the `leafmap.get_wms_layers` function.",
        "The application takes user input for a URL in the `pages/9_ðŸ”²_Vector_Data_Visualization.py` file, which is then used to make a request using the `gpd.read_file` method"
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide an arbitrary URL through the application's user interface.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is described as a 'blind' SSRF because the attacker doesn't directly receive the response to the forged request. Instead, they would need to infer the results through other means (e.g., observing side-effects like server logs)."
