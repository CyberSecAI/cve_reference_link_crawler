Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `download_backup.php` file, where the `$filename` parameter is taken directly from the user via `$_GET['file']` without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject "`/../`" sequences into the `$filename` parameter, enabling them to navigate up the directory structure and access files outside the intended backup directory.
- **Missing Authentication:** The `isAdmin` flag was always `True`, meaning that the path traversal vulnerability could be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can download arbitrary files from the server's file system. This could include sensitive configuration files, system files, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the vulnerable `file` parameter containing path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No authentication is required, as the `isAdmin` flag is always set to `True`.
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes PoC images demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited to download a system file (win.ini).
- The vulnerability was mitigated by:
  - Integrating `basename()` function to sanitize the file path.
  - Implementing authentication via `checkIfAdmin()` function.
  - Adding `file_exists()` and `is_file()` checks.
