| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3099#c0)  Phillip Szelat    2024-06-04 09:04:57 UTC  ``` [This bug can be a potential security issue for users that have implemented a extension block list via matching with $mime_filename, because the filename is not parsed correctly and omits the relevant last part of the filename]  Overview: When a multiline RFC2231 filename (see <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2231#section-3>) in the header of a mail attachment is used exim does not correctly parse the filename, but only populate the first part in $mime_filename.   Steps to Reproduce:  1. use the following config:  acl_smtp_mime = acl_check_mime  begin acl acl_check_mime:     warn decode = default     warn log_message = mimewarn: $mime_part_count $mime_filename  2. receive a mail containing the following rfc2231 header:  MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: application/pdf;         name*0*=iso-8859-1''xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.pd;         name*1=f Content-Disposition: attachment;         filename*0*=iso-8859-1''xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;         filename*1=x.pdf Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64   Actual Results:  In the debugging output and log, $mime_filename is shown as "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx":   Found Content-Type: header - executing acl_smtp_mime. MIME: found content-type: header, value is 'application/pdf' MIME:   considering paramlist 'name*0*=iso-8859-1''xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.pd;name*1=f;' MIME:   considering paramlist 'name*1=f;' MIME: found content-disposition: header, value is 'attachment' MIME:   considering paramlist 'filename*0*=iso-8859-1''xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;filename*1=x.pdf;' MIME:    charset iso-8859-1 fname 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' MIME:    2047-name =?iso-8859-1?Q?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?= MIME:    plain-name xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx MIME:  found filename parameter in content-disposition: header, value is 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' MIME: found content-transfer-encoding: header, value is 'base64' using ACL "acl_check_mime"   The code in [https://git.exim.org/exim.git/blob/HEAD:/src/src/mime.c](https://git.exim.org/exim.git/blob/HEAD%3A/src/src/mime.c) does not forward multiline filenames to $mime_filename correctly.  Expected Results:  $mime_filename should be "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.pdf"  Build Date & Hardware/Additional Builds and Platforms:  Possibly all exim Version, tested on ubuntu 24.04, with exim 4.97 #2 built 31-Mar-2024 ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3099#c1)  Phillip Szelat    2024-06-07 12:22:05 UTC  ``` The same incorrect parsing occurs when the filename includes a new-line character in the header like this:  MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: application/pdf; Content-Disposition: attachment;         filename="Test continue.pdf" Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3099#c2)  Jeremy Harris    2024-06-13 20:54:39 UTC  ``` The first example talks about headers, but shows a line (starting "name*0*=") which cannot be a header as there is a blank line preceding it, which would terminate the headers of a message.  The second exmaple has a line (starting "continue") which is a malformed header in it's own right, not a continuation of the preceding "Content-Disposition" because it does not start with white-space.  Please attach an actual message demonstrating the problem. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3099#c3)  Phillip Szelat    2024-06-14 09:49:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1482](attachment.cgi?id=1482 "example eml leading to the described problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1482&action=edit "example eml leading to the described problem") example eml leading to the described problem  Thanks for looking into this. I probably need to clarify that I talk about the attachment header, which may not be part of the mail header. In my example in the mail header we have "Content-Type: multipart/mixed" and the described problem occurs in the header of the attachment part, which is propagated to $mime_filename.  I have attached an eml file with an anonymized version of the original mail, hope this helps to clarify the problem. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3099#c4)  Heiko Schlichting    2024-07-01 15:30:34 UTC  ``` I can confirm this bug.

MIME Parameter Value and Encoded Word Extensions:
Character Sets, Languages, and Continuations
Status of this Memo
This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1. Abstract
This memo defines extensions to the RFC 2045 media type and RFC 2183
disposition parameter value mechanisms to provide
(1) a means to specify parameter values in character sets
other than US-ASCII,
(2) to specify the language to be used should the value be
displayed, and
(3) a continuation mechanism for long parameter values to
avoid problems with header line wrapping.
This memo also defines an extension to the encoded words defined in
RFC 2047 to allow the specification of the language to be used for
display as well as the character set.
2. Introduction
The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME [RFC-2045, RFC-
2046, RFC-2047, RFC-2048, RFC-2049], define a message format that
allows for:
Freed & Moore Standards Track [Page 1]

RFC 2231 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions November 1997
(1) textual message bodies in character sets other than
US-ASCII,
(2) non-textual message bodies,
(3) multi-part message bodies, and
(4) textual header information in character sets other than
US-ASCII.
MIME is now widely deployed and is used by a variety of Internet
protocols, including, of course, Internet email. However, MIME's
success has resulted in the need for additional mechanisms that were
not provided in the original protocol specification.
In particular, existing MIME mechanisms provide for named media type
(content-type field) parameters as well as named disposition
(content-disposition field). A MIME media type may specify any
number of parameters associated with all of its subtypes, and any
specific subtype may specify additional parameters for its own use. A
MIME disposition value may specify any number of associated
parameters, the most important of which is probably the attachment
disposition's filename parameter.
These parameter names and values end up appearing in the content-type
and content-disposition header fields in Internet email. This
inherently imposes three crucial limitations:
(1) Lines in Internet email header fields are folded
according to RFC 822 folding rules. This makes long
parameter values problematic.
(2) MIME headers, like the RFC 822 headers they often
appear in, are limited to 7bit US-ASCII, and the
encoded-word mechanisms of RFC 2047 are not available
to parameter values. This makes it impossible to have
parameter values in character sets other than US-ASCII
without specifying some sort of private per-parameter
encoding.
(3) It has recently become clear that character set
information is not sufficient to properly display some
sorts of information -- language information is also
needed [RFC-2130]. For example, support for
handicapped users may require reading text string
Freed & Moore Standards Track [Page 2]

RFC 2231 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions November 1997
aloud. The language the text is written in is needed
for this to be done correctly. Some parameter values
may need to be displayed, hence there is a need to
allow for the inclusion of language information.
The last problem on this list is also an issue for the encoded words
defined by RFC 2047, as encoded words are intended primarily for
display purposes.
This document defines extensions that address all of these
limitations. All of these extensions are implemented in a fashion
that is completely compatible at a syntactic level with existing MIME
implementations. In addition, the extensions are designed to have as
little impact as possible on existing uses of MIME.
IMPORTANT NOTE: These mechanisms end up being somewhat gibbous when
they actually are used. As such, these mechanisms should not be used
lightly; they should be reserved for situations where a real need for
them exists.
2.1. Requirements notation
This document occasionally uses terms that appear in capital letters.
When the terms "MUST", "SHOULD", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate particular
requirements of this specification. A discussion of the meanings of
these terms appears in [RFC- 2119].
3. Parameter Value Continuations
Long MIME media type or disposition parameter values do not interact
well with header line wrapping conventions. In particular, proper
header line wrapping depends on there being places where linear
whitespace (LWSP) is allowed, which may or may not be present in a
parameter value, and even if present may not be recognizable as such
since specific knowledge of parameter value syntax may not be
available to the agent doing the line wrapping. The result is that
long parameter values may end up getting truncated or otherwise
damaged by incorrect line wrapping implementations.
A mechanism is therefore needed to break up parameter values into
smaller units that are amenable to line wrapping. Any such mechanism
MUST be compatible with existing MIME processors. This means that
(1) the mechanism MUST NOT change the syntax of MIME media
type and disposition lines, and
Freed & Moore Standards Track [Page 3]

RFC 2231 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions November 1997
(2) the mechanism MUST NOT depend on parameter ordering
since MIME states that parameters are not order
sensitive. Note that while MIME does prohibit
modification of MIME headers during transport, it is
still possible that parameters will be reordered when
user agent level processing is done.
The obvious solution, then, is to use multiple parameters to contain
a single parameter value and to use some kind of distinguished name
to indicate when this is being done. And this obvious solution is
exactly what is specified here: The asterisk character ("\*") followed
by a decimal count is employed to indicate that multiple parameters
are being used to encapsulate a single parameter value. The count
starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each subsequent section of the
parameter value. Decimal values are used and neither leading zeroes
nor gaps in the sequence are allowed.
The original parameter value is recovered by concatenating the
various sections of the parameter, in order. For example, the
content-type field
Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=URL;
URL\*0="ftp://";
URL\*1="cs.utk.edu/pub/moore/bulk-mailer/bulk-mailer.tar"
is semantically identical to
Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=URL;
URL="ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/moore/bulk-mailer/bulk-mailer.tar"
Note that quotes around parameter values are part of the value
syntax; they are NOT part of the value itself. Furthermore, it is
explicitly permitted to have a mixture of quoted and unquoted
continuation fields.
4. Parameter Value Character Set and Language Information
Some parameter values may need to be qualified with character set or
language information. It is clear that a distinguished parameter
name is needed to identify when this information is present along
with a specific syntax for the information in the value itself. In
addition, a lightweight encoding mechanism is needed to accommodate 8
bit information in parameter values.
Freed & Moore Standards Track [Page 4]

RFC 2231 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions November 1997
Asterisks ("\*") are reused to provide the indicator that language and
character set information is present and encoding is being used. A
single quote ("'") is used to delimit the character set and language
information at the beginning of the parameter value. Percent signs
("%") are used as the encoding flag, which agrees with RFC 2047.
Specifically, an asterisk at the end of a parameter name acts as an
indicator that character set and language information may appear at
the beginning of the parameter value. A single quote is used to
separate the character set, language, and actual value information in
the parameter value string, and an percent sign is used to flag
octets encoded in hexadecimal. For example:
Content-Type: application/x-stuff;
title\*=us-ascii'en-us'This%20is%20%2A%2A%2Afun%2A%2A%2A
Note that it is perfectly permissible to leave either the character
set or language field blank. Note also that the single quote
delimiters MUST be present even when one of the field values is
omitted. This is done when either character set, language, or both
are not relevant to the parameter value at hand. This MUST NOT be
done in order to indicate a default character set or language --
parameter field definitions MUST NOT assign a default character set
or language.
4.1. Combining Character Set, Language, and Parameter Continuations
Character set and language information may be combined with the
parameter continuation mechanism. For example:
Content-Type: application/x-stuff
title\*0\*=us-ascii'en'This%20is%20even%20more%20
title\*1\*=%2A%2A%2Afun%2A%2A%2A%20
title\*2="isn't it!"
Note that:
(1) Language and character set information only appear at
the beginning of a given parameter value.
(2) Continuations do not provide a facility for using more
than one character set or language in the same
parameter value.
(3) A value presented using multiple continuations may
contain a mixture of encoded and unencoded segments.
Freed & Moore Standards Track [Page 5]

RFC 2231 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions November 1997
(4) The first segment of a continuation MUST be encoded if
language and character set information are given.
(5) If the first segment of a continued parameter value is
encoded the language and character set field delimiters
MUST be present even when the fields are left blank.
5. Language specification in Encoded Words
RFC 2047 provides support for non-US-ASCII character sets in RFC 822
message header comments, phrases, and any unstructured text field.
This is done by defining an encoded word construct which can appear
in any of these places. Given that these are fields intended for
display, it is sometimes necessary to associate language information
with encoded words as well as just the character set. This
specification extends the definition of an encoded word to allow the
inclusion of such information. This is simply done by suffixing the
character set specification with an asterisk followed by the language
tag. For example:
From: =?US-ASCII\*EN?Q?Keith\_Moore?=
6. IMAP4 Handling of Parameter Values
IMAP4 [RFC-2060] servers SHOULD decode parameter value continuations
when generating the BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE fetch attributes.
7. Modifications to MIME ABNF
The ABNF for MIME parameter values given in RFC 2045 is:
parameter := attribute "=" value
attribute := token
; Matching of attributes
; is ALWAYS case-insensitive.
This specification changes this ABNF to:
parameter := regular-parameter / extended-parameter
regular-parameter := regular-parameter-name "=" value
regular-parameter-name := attribute [section]
attribute := 1\*attribute-char
Freed & Moore Standards Track [Page 6]

RFC 2231 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions November 1997
attribute-char :=
section := initial-section / other-sections
initial-section := "\*0"
other-sections := "\*" ("1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" /
"6" / "7" / "8" / "9") \*DIGIT)
extended-parameter := (extended-initial-name "="
extended-value) /
(extended-other-names "="
extended-other-values)
extended-initial-name := attribute [initial-section] "\*"
extended-other-names := attribute other-sections "\*"
extended-initial-value := [charset] "'" [language] "'"
extended-other-values
extended-other-values := \*(ext-octet / attribute-char)
ext-octet := "%" 2(DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F")
charset :=
language :=
The ABNF given in RFC 2047 for encoded-words is:
encoded-word := "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="
This specification changes this ABNF to:
encoded-word := "=?" charset ["\*" language] "?" encoded-text "?="
8. Character sets which allow specification of language
In the future it is likely that some character sets will provide
facilities for inline language labeling. Such facilities are
inherently more flexible than those defined here as they allow for
language switching in the middle of a string.
Freed & Moore Standards Track [Page 7]

RFC 2231 MIME Value and Encoded Word Extensions November 1997
If and when such facilities are developed they SHOULD be used in
preference to the language labeling facilities specified here. Note
that all the mechanisms defined here allow for the omission of
language labels so as to be able to accommodate this possible future
usage.
9. Security Considerations
This RFC does not discuss security issues and is not believed to
raise any security issues not already endemic in electronic mail and
present in fully conforming implementations of MIME.

=head1 Exim Development Repository

This is the Exim (Mail Transport Agent) Development Repository. Please
read the following information if you wish to use or contribute to the
Exim development process - this is to prevent your or our time being
unnecessarily wasted.

If you just want to use, build or get information on Exim then have a
look at the pointers further down this file at L<General Exim Information>.

=head2 General Development Information

The general Exim development process and resources are documented in
the wiki page at L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximDevelopment> - although
the wiki is likely to be moved and rehashed in the near future.

The sections below this duplicate much of the information form the
wiki document.

=head2 Development Repositories

Exim development is kept within a  git (L<https://git-scm.com/>)
repository. The master repository is at L<git://git.exim.org/exim.git>
with a web interface giving change and source visibility at
L<https://git.exim.org/exim.git>

There is a secondary repository on github at
L<https://github.com/Exim/exim> managed by the Exim Organisation
- however this may currently fall out of synchronisation with the
main one.

=head2 Bug Tracking

Currently this is all done using Bugzilla at L<https://bugs.exim.org/>
- please do not use github issue tracking.

=head2 Mailing List

Development issues are normally discussed on the exim-dev mailing list
- see L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html>

=head2 Exim Release Process

Some documentation on the release process can be found at
L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximRelease>.

=head2 General Exim Information

The best place to get general information is on the website at
L<https://www.exim.org/>.

You can find Download locations L<https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html>,
Mailing list info L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html> and Full
Documentation L<https://www.exim.org/docs.html> on that website.

If you are using a Linux or other freely available Unix like operating
system it is very likely that your system will have Exim packaged for
it already. In this case it is probably prudent to use these packages
unless you have specialised requirements.

In any case you can always ask on the
Exim Users mailing list L<https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/>
for further information.

=head1 Exim Development Repository

This is the Exim (Mail Transport Agent) Development Repository. Please
read the following information if you wish to use or contribute to the
Exim development process - this is to prevent your or our time being
unnecessarily wasted.

If you just want to use, build or get information on Exim then have a
look at the pointers further down this file at L<General Exim Information>.

=head2 General Development Information

The general Exim development process and resources are documented in
the wiki page at L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximDevelopment> - although
the wiki is likely to be moved and rehashed in the near future.

The sections below this duplicate much of the information form the
wiki document.

=head2 Development Repositories

Exim development is kept within a  git (L<https://git-scm.com/>)
repository. The master repository is at L<git://git.exim.org/exim.git>
with a web interface giving change and source visibility at
L<https://git.exim.org/exim.git>

There is a secondary repository on github at
L<https://github.com/Exim/exim> managed by the Exim Organisation
- however this may currently fall out of synchronisation with the
main one.

=head2 Bug Tracking

Currently this is all done using Bugzilla at L<https://bugs.exim.org/>
- please do not use github issue tracking.

=head2 Mailing List

Development issues are normally discussed on the exim-dev mailing list
- see L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html>

=head2 Exim Release Process

Some documentation on the release process can be found at
L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximRelease>.

=head2 General Exim Information

The best place to get general information is on the website at
L<https://www.exim.org/>.

You can find Download locations L<https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html>,
Mailing list info L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html> and Full
Documentation L<https://www.exim.org/docs.html> on that website.

If you are using a Linux or other freely available Unix like operating
system it is very likely that your system will have Exim packaged for
it already. In this case it is probably prudent to use these packages
unless you have specialised requirements.

In any case you can always ask on the
Exim Users mailing list L<https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/>
for further information.
