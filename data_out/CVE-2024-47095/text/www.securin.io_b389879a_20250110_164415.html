## CVE-2024-47095 â Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in Follett School Solutions Destiny Library Manager

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### Follett School Solutions

#### Affected Product

##### Destiny Library Manager

#### CVE

##### CVE-2024-47095

#### Securin ID

##### -

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### September 26, 2024

### Description

Versions of Follett School Solutions Destiny Library manager before v22.0.1 AU1 are affected by a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. Due to this vulnerability, if the application is accessed through an attacker-controlled link, the attacker can display arbitrary (potentially hostile & dangerous) content in the context of the otherwise legitimate website.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

We tested the following vulnerability on a deployment of Follett School Solutions Destiny Library Manager version 21.2.0 RC2.

1. Navigate the application normally to identify the site ID of any valid site within the target deployment. For many deployments the main landing page of the application will consist of links to particular site IDs. As these values are expected to be small integers it is also possible to identify a valid site ID via brute force if necessary.

2. Construct a URL of the form <https://affected.domain/common/servlet/handleloginform.do?expiredSupportMessage=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert()%3E&showSupportExpiredMessage=true&site=1234> where “affected.domain” is replaced with the domain of the deployment and “1234” is replaced with a valid site ID for that deployment.

**Figure 1: Observing arbitrary JavaScript execution as a consequence of accessing the application through a crafted URL.**

### Impact

If a user accesses the vulnerable application through an attacker controlled link, the attacker can arbitrarily modify the contents of the site as displayed to the victim user. This can be abused to achieve a form of vandalism, to spread misinformation, and to steal any passwords users may submit to the site.

### Remediations

Encode special characters prior to reflecting them in an HTML or JavaScript context via server-side templating.
