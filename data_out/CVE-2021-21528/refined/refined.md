Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21528:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an "Exposure of Information through Directory Listing" vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to the file system by exposing directory listings. This means an attacker can potentially see the directory structure and file names, which can lead to further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the filesystem. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored on the file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote and does not require authentication. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected system and does not require any prior authentication or special privileges.

**Affected Versions:**
- Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 9.1.0
- Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 9.2.0.x
- Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 9.2.1.x

**Mitigation:**
The workaround is to ensure the "redirect" flag is set to true in the http-config. This can be done using the following commands:

```
# isi_gconfig -q -t http-config redirect
```
If nothing is returned:
```
# isi_gconfig -q -t http-config redirect=true
```
Confirm the value is now set:
```
# isi_gconfig -q -t http-config redirect
```

For Compliance Mode:
```
# sudo isi_gconfig -q -t http-config redirect
```
If nothing is returned:
```
# sudo isi_gconfig -q -t http-config redirect=true
```
Confirm the value is now set:
```
# sudo isi_gconfig -q -t http-config redirect
```
