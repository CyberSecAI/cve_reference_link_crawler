## FAQ

### How does this compare to front end builders?

While front end builders are nice and easy to use with simple content, there is no substitute for robustness of good back end builder in case you want to build complex layouts. Once you get to know it, Bold Builder, with its advanced capabilities (like stacked clipboard and non-AJAX instant editing), is the fastest way to build your pages.

### Is there a premium version?

No. Actually this is premium version, only difference is that it’s free. 🙂

### Which themes are supported?

It is not possible to test Bold Builder with all themes – it should work fine with most but we recommend Twenty Sixteen and Twenty Seventeen themes. Also, in case you want to use our premium themes, you can find them here: [BoldThemes Portfolio](https://themeforest.net/user/boldthemes/portfolio?ref=bold-page-builder "BoldThemes Portfolio"). Please note that BoldThemes premium themes launched before June 1, 2017 will not have all the options described in this article.

The developers of this builder are obviously missing in action, or simply do not care one iota for people who continue to use it.
There is no response via the support system on wordpress dot org, which is absolutely useless.
The latest update of Bold Builder broke the layout on my Client’s site and there doesn’t appear to be any way to fix it.
What makes matters worse is, this has happened over the last few updates and others have asked for support before me and not received a single answer or acknowledgment.
I am going to encourage my Client to let me rebuild their website, as the current state of this plugin is disastrous.
STAY AWAY FROM BOLD BUILDER!!! If I could give it no stars at all, I would.

I regret choosing the Stellarium template from BoldTheme. While the design looked promising initially, the actual functionality fell far short of expectations.
False Advertising: The template was advertised as WooCommerce-compatible, but critical features, like “Add to Cart” and “Checkout,” simply don’t work as expected. Combining WooCommerce with other elements like the Cost Calculator is impossible, a limitation that wasn’t clearly disclosed beforehand.
Technical Issues: The template constantly triggered errors related to the “Coming Soon” plugin and other core functionalities. Instead of providing solutions, support deflected responsibility, making these issues my problem to fix.
Subpar Support: Despite paying for extended support, the assistance was unhelpful and dismissive. Simple requests, like making the demo work as advertised, were ignored. The team suggested submitting a refund request rather than resolving the issues—a deeply frustrating experience for a paying customer.
Misleading Setup: The demo content and WooCommerce functionality do not replicate the advertised examples. If you’re looking for a functional e-commerce solution, this template is far from ready out of the box.
I rarely leave reviews, but this experience was extremely disappointing. I would not recommend this template unless you’re prepared to spend hours troubleshooting and rebuilding features that should work from the start.

My website has been ready for a long time, but the requests for my offered service were too low, so I hired an agency to improve it. Now I had a new theme and I have to rewrite all the texts. An administrator was also added, who simply put everything on my server without giving me a detailed explanation. Problem: I am a German native speaker. Now that I have watched many youtube videos and found the document for the theme customization it works quite well. A better explanation of the setup would be nice.

This is still a page builder under development. It has to go miles before even making it a production one. Lacking a lot of features, especially the most basic ones. Also it doesn’t have a working frontend live editor. The one it has is not working on chrome or firefox (the 2 browsers I tested).
