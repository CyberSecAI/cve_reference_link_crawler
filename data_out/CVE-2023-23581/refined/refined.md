The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2023-23581.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `EnSafeHttpHeaderValueStr` function of SoftEther VPN. This function attempts to sanitize HTTP header values by replacing or removing certain characters like `\r`, `\n`, `\\r` and `\\n`. The issue arises in the handling of escaped characters `\\r` and `\\n` during the sanitization process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: When the code encounters `\\r` or `\\n`, it uses `Move(&str[index], &str[index + 2], length - index)` which reads one byte past the end of the string due to how the `Move` function is implemented, since it copies from `[index+2]` and the length is `length - index`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with `\\r` or `\\n` sequences in the header, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read, which will cause the server to crash and become unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malicious HTTP request to a vulnerable SoftEther VPN server.
- The server listens for HTTP connections on ports 443, 992, 1194 and 5555 by default.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network connectivity to the target server.
- Ability to craft and send a malicious HTTP request with `\\r` or `\\n` sequences in the header.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
