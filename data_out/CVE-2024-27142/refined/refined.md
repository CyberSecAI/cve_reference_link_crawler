      "Plaintext Storage of a Password (CWE-256)",
      "Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information (CWE-1295)",
      "Use of Default Credentials (CWE-1392)",
      "Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)",
      "Use of Hard-coded Password (CWE-259)",
      "Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79)",
      "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)",

       "Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel (CWE-288)",
        "Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution as root or other privileged users, bypass authentication mechanisms, gain access to sensitive information, and cause denial-of-service conditions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Unauthenticated HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints.",
      "SNMP with default credentials.",
      "Web interface file upload vulnerabilities.",
      "Local file inclusion vulnerabilities.",

    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. Specific exploits may require administrative credentials for some specific vulnerabilities, while others are pre-authenticated or rely on insecure default configurations. Knowledge of the specific vulnerable APIs and file paths is also needed."
