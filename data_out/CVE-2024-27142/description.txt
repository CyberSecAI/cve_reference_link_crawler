Toshiba printers use XML communication for the API endpoint provided by the printer. For the endpoint, XML parsing library is used and it is vulnerable to a time-based blind XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability. An attacker can DoS the printers. An attacker can exploit the XXE to retrieve information. As for the affected products/models/versions, see the reference URL.
