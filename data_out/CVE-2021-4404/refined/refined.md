    "Root cause": "Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `ajaxHandler()` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can trick a site administrator into performing unintended actions, such as opting into notifications, via a forged request.",
     "Attack vector": "The attacker crafts a malicious link or form that, when clicked or submitted by a logged-in administrator, sends a forged request to the vulnerable plugin.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in site administrator to click a link or submit a form, usually through social engineering."
