- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of user input when a visual (view/dashboard/report) fails to load. Specifically, the application doesn't properly escape user input when generating the URL for a non-existent visual, which allows for crafted URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input sanitization, specifically in handling URLs related to non-existent visuals. The application generates URLs that include user-supplied parameters without escaping them properly.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft phishing links to redirect Checkmk users to malicious URLs if they access a non-existent visual. The user would have to click the malicious link, so the impact is limited to the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through crafted URLs included in phishing links, which are then accessed by the user. The user then has to click the malicious link for the attack to be successful.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to craft and distribute a malicious URL (e.g., via phishing). No prior authentication is required (PR:N) by the attacker. The user has to click on the link for exploitation to occur (UI:R)
