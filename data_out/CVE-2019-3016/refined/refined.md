{
  "CVE-2019-3016": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The KVM hypervisor may provide a guest with the ability to defer remote TLB flushes when the remote VCPU is not running. Under certain circumstances, the hypervisor may miss the request, or the guest may mistakenly assume the request was processed. This leads to an invalid translation being present in a vCPU.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Race condition in handling deferred TLB flushes.",
      "Hypervisor may miss guest's remote flush request.",
       "Guest may mistakenly assume hypervisor processed a flush request"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information by accessing memory locations within the guest that should not be accessible.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker within a guest VM can trigger the race condition by initiating deferred TLB flush requests.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a KVM guest VM, with paravirtual TLB flushes enabled."
