| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1792167#c0)  msiddiqu    2020-01-17 08:11:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled deferred TLB flush requests from guest. A race condition may occur between guest issuing a deferred TLB flush request to KVM and KVM handling and acknowledging it. This may result in invalid address translations from TLB being used to access guest memory, leading to potential information leakage issue.  A guest user/process may use this flaw to access guest memory locations which it should not have access to.
