Debian Bug     : 960271

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3016

    It was discovered that the KVM implementation for x86 did not
    always perform TLB flushes when needed, if the paravirtualised
    TLB flush feature was enabled.  This could lead to disclosure of
    sensitive information within a guest VM.

CVE-2019-19462

    The syzkaller tool found a missing error check in the 'relay'
    library used to implement various files under debugfs.  A local
    user permitted to access debugfs could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0543

    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
    supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
    value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
    speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
    local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
    information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.

    This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
    as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
    package in Debian's non-free archive section.  This kernel update
    only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
    disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

CVE-2020-10711

    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues in the
    SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet with null category. A
    remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service (crash). Note that this issue does not affect the binary
    packages distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

CVE-2020-10732

    An information leak of kernel private memory to userspace was found
    in the kernel's implementation of core dumping userspace processes.

CVE-2020-10751

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
    handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
    attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10757

    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX hugepages,
    allowing a local user to escalate their privileges.

CVE-2020-12114

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
    pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs).  A local user
    with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
    result in a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this can be
    exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12768

    A bug was discovered in the KVM implementation for AMD processors,
    which could result in a memory leak.  The security impact of this
    is unclear.

CVE-2020-12770

    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
    correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
    A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-13143

    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
    the USB gadget subsystem.  A local user permitted to write to
    the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.19.118-2+deb10u1.  This version also fixes some related
bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in the
<linux/swab.h> UAPI header introduced in the previous point release
(bug #960271).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
