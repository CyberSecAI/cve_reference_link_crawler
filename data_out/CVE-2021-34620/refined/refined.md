Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34620:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `Acl::verify` method in the WP Fluent Forms plugin did not perform a nonce check, making AJAX actions vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). While the plugin performed capability checks using `Acl::hasPermission`, the lack of a nonce check allowed attackers to bypass these checks through forged requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin's AJAX actions. This allowed an attacker to craft malicious requests and trick an authenticated user into executing them.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, attackers could inject arbitrary JavaScript into form settings. This JavaScript would then be executed in the browsers of visitors to those forms, leading to stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Site takeover:** By injecting malicious JavaScript through the XSS vulnerability, attackers could create new admin accounts, add backdoors, or perform other actions leading to full site takeover.
- **Arbitrary modifications:** Attackers could modify plugin settings, grant access to lower-level users, or alter form configurations.
- **Malicious JavaScript injection:**  The injected JavaScript could redirect users, steal cookies, or perform other malicious actions on a victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Social engineering:** Attackers would need to trick a logged-in administrator (or user with full form settings access) into clicking a malicious link, submitting a form on an attacker-controlled site, or interacting with compromised content designed to make an AJAX request to the vulnerable site.
- **Forged AJAX requests:** Attackers could craft malicious AJAX requests targeting vulnerable endpoints in the WP Fluent Forms plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need to authenticate on the victim website.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to socially engineer a privileged user into initiating the malicious request.
- **Targeted attack:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable AJAX requests to construct a working malicious payload.
