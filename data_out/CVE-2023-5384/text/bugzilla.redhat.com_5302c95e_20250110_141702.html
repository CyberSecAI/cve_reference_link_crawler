| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2242156#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2023-10-04 16:14:45 UTC  ``` When serializing the configuration for a cache to XML/JSON/YAML which contains credentials (JDBC store with connection pooling, Remote store) the credentials are returned in clear text as part of the configuration.  The issue's impact is limited because only users with the ADMIN permission can retrieve the cache configurations, and the recommended approach for connecting via JDBC is using the `datasource` configuration which does not expose the database credentials.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2242156#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-06 19:04:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Data Grid 8.4.6  Via RHSA-2023:7676 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7676](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7676)   ``` |  |
