Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5465

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied parameters within the `Popup with fancybox` WordPress plugin's shortcode and a lack of proper preparation in existing SQL queries. Specifically, the plugin directly incorporates the `group` and `id` attributes of the shortcode into a SQL query without adequate escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure handling of the `group` and `id` parameters passed to the `Popupwfb_shortcode` function. These parameters are directly concatenated into a SQL query string, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-supplied input via shortcode attributes is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in database queries.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin does not use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which are essential to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the WordPress database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries, including user credentials, site data, and other confidential details.
- **Data Manipulation:** It's likely that attackers could also modify or delete data within the database, potentially compromising the integrity and availability of the WordPress site.
- **Complete Site Takeover:** With sufficient SQL injection capabilities, attackers could potentially gain full control of the WordPress website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the use of the plugin's shortcode `[popupwfancybox]`. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code within the `group` and `id` attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "subscriber" level permissions to utilize the shortcode functionality. This is due to the way shortcodes are typically processed within WordPress.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code resides within the `Popupwfb_shortcode` function in the `popup-with-fancybox.php` file. The code constructs a SQL query string as follows (prior to the fix):

```php
$sSql = "select * from " . Popupwfb_Table . " where Popupwfb_status = 'YES'";
if ($Popupwfb_group <> "" && $Popupwfb_id <> "") {
    $sSql = $sSql . " and Popupwfb_group='$Popupwfb_group'";
    if ($Popupwfb_id > 0) {
        $sSql = $sSql . " and Popupwfb_id=$Popupwfb_id";
    }
} else if ($Popupwfb_group <> "" && $Popupwfb_id == "") {
    $sSql = $sSql . " and Popupwfb_group='$Popupwfb_group'";
} else if ($Popupwfb_group == "" && $Popupwfb_id <> "") {
    if ($Popupwfb_id > 0) {
        $sSql = $sSql . " and Popupwfb_id=$Popupwfb_id";
    }
}
```

As you can see, the values of `$Popupwfb_group` and `$Popupwfb_id` are directly embedded into the query string without any sanitization or parameterization using `$wpdb->prepare()`. This allows an attacker to craft malicious shortcode attributes like `group='test' OR 1=1 --'` or `id=1 UNION SELECT user_login, user_pass FROM wp_users -- ` to inject arbitrary SQL.

**Patched Code:**
The corrected code uses `$wpdb->prepare()` to properly sanitize and parameterize the SQL query.

```php
$sSql = "select * from ".Popupwfb_Table." where Popupwfb_status = 'YES'";
if($Popupwfb_group <> "" && $Popupwfb_id <> "")
{
	$sSql = $sSql . " and Popupwfb_group = %s ";
    $sSql = $wpdb->prepare($sSql, $Popupwfb_group);
	if($Popupwfb_id > 0)
	{
		$sSql = $sSql . " and Popupwfb_id = %d ";
        $sSql = $wpdb->prepare($sSql, $Popupwfb_id);
	}
}
else if($Popupwfb_group <> "" && $Popupwfb_id == "")
{
	$sSql = $sSql . " and Popupwfb_group = %s ";
    $sSql = $wpdb->prepare($sSql, $Popupwfb_group);
}
else if($Popupwfb_group == "" && $Popupwfb_id <> "")
{
	if($Popupwfb_id > 0)
	{
		$sSql = $sSql . " and Popupwfb_id = %d ";
        $sSql = $wpdb->prepare($sSql, $Popupwfb_id);
	}
}
```
