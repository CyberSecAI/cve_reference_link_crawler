Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-49606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Tinyproxy handles HTTP `Connection` and `Proxy-Connection` headers during request processing. Specifically, the `remove_connection_headers()` function incorrectly manages memory when removing headers specified within the `Connection` or `Proxy-Connection` header values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (CWE-416):** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. When a client sends a `Connection` header with a value that is the same as another header name, the code frees the memory associated with the header value, but then attempts to use the freed memory, leading to memory corruption.
*   Specifically, the code first retrieves the value of the `Connection` header, which is a comma-separated list of headers to remove. Then, for each header listed in the `Connection` header's value, the code attempts to remove them from the internal data structure. If one of the headers to remove is the same as the `Connection` or `Proxy-Connection` headers, it results in the same memory being freed twice, resulting in a Use-After-Free vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, which may cause a crash.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The memory corruption can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Tinyproxy server, without needing any authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tinyproxy server.
*   No specific attacker position or privileges are required, other than the ability to communicate with the server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `remove_connection_headers()` function within `src/reqs.c`.
*   The `orderedmap_remove()` function frees the memory associated with a header value but then reuses the freed pointer as a key, causing the UAF.
*   The specific example of a malicious header is `Connection: Connection`, however similar issues exist with the `Proxy-Connection` header.
*   A sample exploit is provided by the content, which is simply a crafted HTTP request containing a vulnerable `Connection` or `Proxy-Connection` header.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Tinyproxy 1.11.1
*   Tinyproxy 1.10.0

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability has been fixed by this commit: `https://github.com/tinyproxy/tinyproxy/commit/12a8484265f7b00591293da492bb3c9987001956`
*  Users are advised to update to version 1.11.2 or apply the patch provided by the commit.
