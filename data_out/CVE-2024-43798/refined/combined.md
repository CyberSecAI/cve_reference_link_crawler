# AUTH environment variable not respected in server entrypoint

GHSA-38jh-8h67-m7mj
Aug 26, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/jpillora/chisel
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v1.10.0

## Patched versions

v1.10.0

## Description

### Summary

The Chisel server doesn't ever read the documented `AUTH` environment variable used to set credentials, which allows any unauthenticated user to connect, even if credentials were set. This advisory is a formalization of a report sent to the maintainer via email.

### Details

In the help page for the `chisel server` subcommand, it mentions an `AUTH` environment variable that can be set in order to provide credentials that the server should authenticate connections against:

[chisel/main.go](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/blob/3de177432cd23db58e57f376b62ad497cc10840f/main.go#L138)

Line 138
in
[3de1774](/jpillora/chisel/commit/3de177432cd23db58e57f376b62ad497cc10840f)

|  | authfile with {"<user:pass>": [""]}. If unset, it will use the |
| --- | --- |

.

The issue is that the server entrypoint doesn't ever read the `AUTH` environment variable. The only place that this happens is in the client entrypoint:

[chisel/main.go](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/blob/3de177432cd23db58e57f376b62ad497cc10840f/main.go#L452)

Line 452
in
[3de1774](/jpillora/chisel/commit/3de177432cd23db58e57f376b62ad497cc10840f)

|  | config.Auth = os.Getenv("AUTH") |
| --- | --- |

This subverts the expectations set by the documentation, allowing unauthenticated users to connect to a Chisel server, even if auth is attempted to be set up in this manner.

### PoC

Run `chisel server`, first specifying credentials with the `AUTH` environment variable, then with the `--auth` argument. In the first case, the server allows connections without authentication, while in the second, the correct behavior is exhibited.

### Impact

Anyone who is running the Chisel server, and that is using the `AUTH` environment variable to specify credentials to authenticate against. Chisel is often used to provide an entrypoint to a private network, which means services that are gated by Chisel may be affected. Additionally, Chisel is often used for exposing services to the internet. An attacker could MITM requests by connecting to a Chisel server and requesting to forward traffic from a remote port.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
