The content is related to CVE-2024-43798.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Chisel server does not read the `AUTH` environment variable, which is intended to set authentication credentials. This is because the code for reading the `AUTH` variable is only present in the client entrypoint, not in the server entrypoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for the server when the `AUTH` environment variable is used, resulting in CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-1068 (Incorrectly Implemented Security Check).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated user can connect to the Chisel server, potentially gaining access to a private network or performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack by forwarding traffic from a remote port. This could expose services intended to be protected by authentication and allow an attacker to intercept network traffic.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. The attacker connects to the Chisel server over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Chisel server. No special privileges or user interaction is needed.
