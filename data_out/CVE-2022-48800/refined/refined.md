The provided content relates to a fix for a deadlock issue in the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem, specifically within the `vmscan` module. This deadlock was observed during memory compaction operations and is addressed by commit `b485c6f1f9f54b81443efda5f3d8a5036ba2cd91` which is then backported in commit `3980cff6349687f73d5109f156f23cb261c24164`. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a deadlock scenario that can occur during memory compaction, particularly when `CONFIG_PREEMPT=n` is set (non-preemptive kernel). The kcompactd daemon can get stuck, leading to a soft lockup. This happens when a task migrates pages and isolates a large number of pages from the LRU, which then waits for kcompactd to reschedule so that these isolated pages can be released, but kcompactd isn't rescheduling due to throttling logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deadlock:** The core vulnerability is a deadlock where kcompactd is not rescheduling when it should be, causing tasks to wait indefinitely for pages to be released
- **Throttling Logic Flaw**: The `reclaim_throttle` function would not reschedule if `sc->skipped_deactivate == 1` due to the conditions, leading to the deadlock.
- **Non-preemptive Kernel Specific:** The vulnerability was specific to configurations where the kernel is built without preemption (`CONFIG_PREEMPT=n`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Unresponsiveness:** The deadlock leads to a soft lockup, where the system becomes unresponsive, requiring a reboot to recover.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system becomes unusable due to the deadlock, resulting in a denial of service.
- **kcompactd Soft Lockup**: Specifically, the `kcompactd` kernel thread gets stuck, causing soft lockup warnings from the watchdog timer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Memory Pressure:** Triggering the vulnerability requires creating a scenario with significant memory pressure.
- **Page Migration:** Specifically, a process that migrates pages, isolates a large number of pages and then waits for the compaction daemon to free up pages.
- **Specific Kernel Configuration:** The issue is specifically triggered in non-preemptive kernel configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Generate Memory Pressure:** The attacker needs to be able to allocate a significant amount of memory and trigger page migration.
- **System Access (potentially):** While not necessarily a remote exploit, the attacker needs some way to cause memory pressure which likely requires some access to the system itself.
- **Kernel Knowledge:** Understanding of how the Linux memory management works (specifically page reclaim and compaction) and how to trigger those conditions is beneficial for an attacker.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- **Specific scenario:** The issue was triggered on a machine with 256GB of RAM and no swap.
- **Fix:** The fix addresses the deadlock by ensuring that `reclaim_throttle()` calls `cond_resched()` to allow other tasks to run when a task is performing I/O or is a kthread.
