- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `intranet/cgi-bin/cataloging/ysearch.pl` file of the Koha Library Software. The code constructs a SQL query by concatenating user-controlled input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `$field` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability is present due to lack of sanitization of user-provided input (`$field` parameter). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to obtain arbitrary data from the Koha SQL server. This includes potentially sensitive data from the database.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via HTTP requests to the `/cgi-bin/koha/cataloguing/ysearch.pl` endpoint. The attacker can manipulate the `field` parameter in the request to inject malicious SQL code.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Koha instance. The attacker does not require any authentication to trigger this vulnerability.
