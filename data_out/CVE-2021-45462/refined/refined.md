Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-45462:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper error checking and handling of GTP-U packets within the packet core, specifically within the Open5GS implementation. The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the GTP-U packet length, particularly when a zero-length packet is received.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly validate the length field in the GTP-U header. A crafted GTP-U packet with a zero length field can bypass sanity checks, leading to a crash.
- **State Machine Issues**: Some implementations maintain a state machine for packet traversal. Improper implementation of the state machine might result in processing the inner GTP-U packet which bypasses the checks phase since it shares the same packet-context with the outer packet.
- **GTP-U in GTP-U:** The vulnerability can be triggered by encapsulating a crafted GTP-U packet within another GTP-U packet (GTP-U in GTP-U), which can lead to unexpected behavior in the User Plane Function (UPF) or Serving Gateway User Plane Function (SGW-U).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** The most direct impact is a denial-of-service condition. Sending a crafted zero-length GTP-U packet can crash the UPF (in 5G) or SGW-U (in 4G/LTE) effectively taking down the affected network component.
- **Potential Information Leakage:** In addition to DoS, the attack can potentially leak sensitive information, such as the IP addresses of infrastructure nodes, due to improper handling of the crafted packet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Packets from User Devices:** The attack vector involves a user device (UE) crafting a malicious GTP-U packet and sending it to the network infrastructure. This means the attacker only needs a mobile phone or a computer with a cellular connection and some custom code.
- **GTP-U in GTP-U Encapsulation:** The crafted packet is encapsulated within a legitimate GTP-U packet, which is then sent through the network. The vulnerability arises when the UPF/SGW-U processes the inner malicious GTP-U packet after decapsulating the outer one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the cellular network, which implies having access to a valid SIM card or the ability to spoof it.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the capability to craft GTP-U packets and send them over the cellular network. This can be achieved with relatively simple coding, making it accessible to attackers with moderate technical skills.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any special network privileges or access to the core network. The attack can be launched from a regular user's device.

**Additional Notes**
- The content notes that while IPsec is recommended, operators may not deploy it due to the CPU intensiveness. This also makes it harder to detect these attacks.

In summary, the vulnerability is a result of insufficient input validation and lack of proper state machine implementation that allows for a crafted GTP-U packet, which can be created by a user and sent to the core network to crash critical infrastructure.
