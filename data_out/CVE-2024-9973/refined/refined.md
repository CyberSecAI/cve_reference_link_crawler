Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9973 (Note: The CVE description is a placeholder in the prompt.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Online Eyewear Shop Website" version 1.0, specifically due to unsanitized user input in the `date` parameter of the report viewing page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `date` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, order details, and other confidential data.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows unauthorized access to the application's database, potentially enabling further malicious activities.
- **System Compromise:** In severe cases, the attacker could potentially gain control over the database server and the web server, leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request targeting the report viewing page (`/admin/?page=reports`) and injects malicious SQL code within the `date` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable URL and the parameter (`date`) that is susceptible to SQL injection.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker requires an understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to craft effective payloads.

**Additional Information:**
- **Vulnerable URL:** `/admin/?page=reports&date=2024-10-13`
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided HTTP request demonstrates the SQL injection using a time-based sleep function.
- **Exploitation tools**: SQLMap was used to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- **Affected Version:** Version 1.0 of the Online Eyewear Shop Website.
- **Status:** The vulnerability is currently unpatched, meaning there is no available fix or mitigation.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for significant data breaches and system compromise.
