This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

[security] Fix crash when the Upgrade header cannot be read ([#2231](https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231))

[Browse files](/websockets/ws/tree/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c)

```
It is possible that the Upgrade header is correctly received and handled
(the `'upgrade'` event is emitted) without its value being returned to
the user. This can happen if the number of received headers exceed the
`server.maxHeadersCount` or `request.maxHeadersCount` threshold. In this
case `incomingMessage.headers.upgrade` may not be set.

Handle the case correctly and abort the handshake.

Fixes [#2230](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230)
```
