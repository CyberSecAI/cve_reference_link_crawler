**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly control access to certain functions or actions within the plugin. This allows unauthorized users to perform privileged operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The specific impact is not detailed in this report, but the general description states that a broken access control vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action. The potential impact varies depending on the specific function exposed due to the broken access control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable function(s) within the plugin that lacks proper access controls. A user with minimal privileges (such as a "Subscriber") can exploit these missing checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user with the "Subscriber" role. No further details provided, it is assumed the attacker must be able to interact with the affected functions of the plugin.
