This is not the solution we are looking for. For example, this does not account for the `forwarded` header.

I think we want something like Rails have, where you can allow values you trust for the host and forwarded host header: <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#actiondispatch-hostauthorization>

| Hi, [@dentarg](https://github.com/dentarg)  I think you want similar approach to fixing the issue as case in Rails.   * [The X-Forwarded-Host HTTP header is always trusted and is used in url\_for rails/rails#29893](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/29893)   Unfortunately, I'm not a Ruby expert but rather a security engineer, so I don't have the resources to write code at that level without any issues.  I mentioned it in the previous comment, but please also consider the approach used in Django for fixing the issue.   * [django/django@893cea2](https://github.com/django/django/commit/893cea211ae88c6f68a6c2c281890d6f63541286)   However, I can review the code for fixng issue. Thank you for your review. |

| As I've stated, just adding a setting `use_x_forwarded_host` does not cover the `forwarded` header. |
