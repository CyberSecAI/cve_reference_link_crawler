This is not the solution we are looking for. For example, this does not account for the `forwarded` header.

I think we want something like Rails have, where you can allow values you trust for the host and forwarded host header: <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#actiondispatch-hostauthorization>

| Hi, [@dentarg](https://github.com/dentarg)  I think you want similar approach to fixing the issue as case in Rails.   * [The X-Forwarded-Host HTTP header is always trusted and is used in url\_for rails/rails#29893](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/29893)   Unfortunately, I'm not a Ruby expert but rather a security engineer, so I don't have the resources to write code at that level without any issues.  I mentioned it in the previous comment, but please also consider the approach used in Django for fixing the issue.   * [django/django@893cea2](https://github.com/django/django/commit/893cea211ae88c6f68a6c2c281890d6f63541286)   However, I can review the code for fixng issue. Thank you for your review. |

[CVE-2024-21510  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21510) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-807  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/807.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `sinatra` to version 4.1.0 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision via the `X-Forwarded-Host (XFH)` header. When making a request to a method with redirect applied, it is possible to trigger an Open Redirect Attack by inserting an arbitrary address into this header. If used for caching purposes, such as with servers like Nginx, or as a reverse proxy, without handling the `X-Forwarded-Host` header, attackers can potentially exploit Cache Poisoning or Routing-based SSRF.
