This PR updates the Simple SVG renderer to properly escape special characters from GeoServer catalog information.

NOTE: This PR only updates code that could be executed through actual GeoServer WMS GetMap requests and ignores any potential issues in dead code.

Is SVGWriter.encodeAttribute as good as `StringEscapeUtils`?

Also, groupId is basically the type name... why bother about the type name (admin configured) but not about the attribute names, in `SVGWriter.startFeature`?

SVGWriter.encodeAttribute doesn't exist. There is a AttributesSVGHandler.encodeAttribute but that is a private non-static method on a non-static inner class of SVGWriter and, even though it would prevent injection, it may not actually guarantee valid XML output.

SVGWriter has a lot dead code and I only updated code that could actually be run in a live GeoServer.

These are examples of where a lot of the SVGWriter functionality gets commented out:

| oh my! What an oldie! that was the very first WMS output format, even before any raster image one IIRC. There was no pull-push XML API by then, SAX sucked for streaming, and DOM wasn't an option. You're not up for a re-write using StAX, aren't you? Glad to see someone is using it though. |
