  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A logical weakness during the capture of a payment in case of disabled webhooks allows a malicious customer to confirm an order as 'payment accepted' even if the payment is ultimately declined by PayPal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improperly implemented security check for payment status.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious customer can confirm an order with a fraudulent payment, leading to the processing of an order without receiving actual payment.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network. Exploitation of a logical weakness when webhooks are disabled.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low privileges are required. The attacker is a customer with the ability to place orders on the e-commerce platform."
