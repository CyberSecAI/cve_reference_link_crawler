Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-25119

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plaintext value of the encryption key (`$GLOBALS['SYS']['encryptionKey']`) was displayed in the editing forms of the TYPO3 Install Tool user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The system inappropriately exposes sensitive information (the encryption key) through the user interface.
- Use of Hardcoded/Exposed Encryption Key: The encryption key, intended to secure cryptographic processes, is being displayed in plaintext making it easily obtainable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the exposed encryption key can use it to generate valid cryptographic hashes.
- This allows the attacker to forge HTTP request parameters, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or gaining further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`).
- The attack complexity is low (`AC:L`).
- The attacker needs high privileges, specifically an administrator-level backend user account with system maintainer permissions (`PR:H`).
- No user interaction is required (`UI:N`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have compromised an administrator-level backend account with system maintainer permissions. This implies a high level of access is required before the exploit can be used.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the TYPO3 Install Tool.
- The attacker must be able to view the user interface elements where the encryption key is displayed in plain text.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of TYPO3 CMS: 8.0.0-8.7.56, 9.0.0-9.5.45, 10.0.0-10.4.42, 11.0.0-11.5.34, 12.0.0-12.4.10, 13.0.0.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a severity of "Medium" by TYPO3 and a CVSS score of 4.9, with a vector string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`. This reflects a high confidentiality impact and no impact on integrity or availability.
- Patched versions are: 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1.
