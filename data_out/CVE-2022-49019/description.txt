In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: nixge: fix NULL dereference

In function nixge_hw_dma_bd_release() dereference of NULL pointer
priv->rx_bd_v is possible for the case of its allocation failure in
nixge_hw_dma_bd_init().

Move for() loop with priv->rx_bd_v dereference under the check for
its validity.
