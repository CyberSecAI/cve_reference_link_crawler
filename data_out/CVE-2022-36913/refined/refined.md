Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36913:

**CVE-2022-36913**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Openstack Heat Plugin 1.5 and earlier.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.
*   **Weakness:** Missing permission check.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system. By sending a sequence of requests, the attacker can effectively list the Jenkins controller file system.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable form validation endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.

**Summary:**
The Openstack Heat Plugin lacks proper permission checks, allowing authenticated users with Overall/Read access to probe the Jenkins controller's file system by sending specially crafted requests. This effectively allows file system enumeration.
