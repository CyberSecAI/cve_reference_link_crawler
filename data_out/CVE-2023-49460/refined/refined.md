The provided content is related to CVE-2023-49460.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurring within the `decode_uncompressed_image` function of the libheif library. This indicates a memory access issue, specifically a read operation to an invalid memory address (0x000000000000), which typically points to the null or zero page. The crash occurs during a memcpy operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to an invalid memory access when decoding an uncompressed image.
- Specifically, the `memcpy` operation attempts to read from a null pointer/invalid address during the decoding process within `UncompressedImageCodec::decode_uncompressed_image` function

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault (SEGV), leading to a crash of the application using libheif.
- Denial of service due to application termination.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted HEIF image file that utilizes uncompressed image data, leading to a crash during the decoding process.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates that the vulnerability is triggered when converting a crafted PNG file using heif-convert with the uncompressed codec enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a maliciously crafted HEIF/PNG file to an application that utilizes the vulnerable `libheif` library.
- The application needs to enable the uncompressed codec option to trigger the vulnerability.
