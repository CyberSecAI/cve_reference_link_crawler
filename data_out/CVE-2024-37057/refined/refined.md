The provided content is a security advisory from HiddenLayer detailing multiple vulnerabilities in MLflow. One of the described vulnerabilities is **CVE-2024-37057**, which is relevant to the query.

**CVE-2024-37057 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Deserialization vulnerability in the `mlflow/tensorflow/__init__.py` file, specifically within the `_load_custom_objects` function. This function uses `cloudpickle.load` to deserialize custom objects, making it susceptible to malicious pickle objects.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The use of `cloudpickle.load` on untrusted data (custom objects logged with the model) allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code during model loading.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine when a model is loaded, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious pickle object within a custom function, adds it under the `custom_objects` parameter when calling the `model.tensorflow.log_model()` function, and logs the model to the server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to log a model to an MLflow server accessible by the victim. The victim then needs to load the model using `mlflow.tensorflow.load_model`.

**Summary of all vulnerabilities described in the advisory:**

The advisory details multiple remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities arising from insecure deserialization of Python objects within MLflow, a platform for managing machine learning models. The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the use of `pickle.load` and `cloudpickle.load` on untrusted data when loading models, custom objects, or recipe cards. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into model files, which is then executed on the victim's machine when the model is loaded.

The vulnerable components include:

*   **CVE-2024-37052, CVE-2024-37053:**  `sklearn/__init__.py` (`_load_model_from_local_file` function) using `pickle.load` or `cloudpickle.load`.
*   **CVE-2024-37054:**  `mlflow/pyfunc/model.py` (`_load_context_model_and_signature` function) using `cloudpickle.load`.
*  **CVE-2024-37055:** `pmdarima/__init__.py` (`_load_model` function) using `pickle.load`
*  **CVE-2024-37056:** `mlflow/lightgbm/__init__.py` (`_load_model` function) using `cloudpickle.load` for scikit-learn models
*   **CVE-2024-37057:**  `mlflow/tensorflow/__init__.py` (`_load_custom_objects` function) using `cloudpickle.load`.
*   **CVE-2024-37058:**  `mlflow/langchain/utils.py` (`_load_from_pickle` function) using `cloudpickle.load`. Also, code injection in `_save_base_lcs` can be used to inject a malicious pickle object.
*   **CVE-2024-37059:** `mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py` (`_load_model` function) uses `torch.load` which can be vulnerable to pickle injection via specially crafted PyTorch model.
*  **CVE-2024-37060:** `recipes/cards/__init__.py` within the `BaseCard` class (`load` static method) using `pickle.load`.
*  **CVE-2024-37061:** MLproject `run` procedure in the `_run_entry_point` function, within the `projects/backend/local.py` file that allows for code injection via crafted commands in the MLproject YAML file.

These vulnerabilities span different versions of MLflow, starting from 0.5.0 up to 2.5.0. All have a CVSS score of 8.8, highlighting the critical severity of these issues. The primary CWE is CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data, with CVE-2024-37059 and CVE-2024-37061 also referencing CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code. The attack vectors require an attacker to log a model to an MLflow server, which is then loaded by a victim.
