The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence, and it includes detailed information about CVE-2021-44383, among other CVEs.

**CVE-2021-44383 Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Affected Product:** Reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102
*   **Root Cause:** Improper Input Validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. The parser expects a JSON object for the `param` field of a command, but it does not validate the input type and crashes when it's not an object.
*   **Weakness:** The code assumes that the JSON `param` element is always a JSON object. When it receives a different type (e.g., string) it will attempt to access it as an object using the subscription operator, leading to a program assert.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A specially crafted HTTP request with an invalid `param` field can cause the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash, which leads to a device reboot due to the lack of heartbeat from the crashed process.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending an HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the command and an invalid `param` value (e.g., an empty string).
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device. While most of the vulnerable APIs require authentication, the report mentions that it's possible to bypass authentication using a separate vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420).
*   **Specific Vulnerability:** The `SetAutoUpgrade` API call is vulnerable. The `param` field must be a JSON object and not a string.

**Technical Details:**

The report provides the following key technical insights:

*   The `cgiserver.cgi` process parses commands and parameters sent as a JSON array in the HTTP request body.
*   The code uses the `Json::Value::operator[]` to access JSON elements.
*   If a JSON element is neither `null` nor `object`, an assert is triggered, and the `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes.
*   The `body_request_to_command` function parses the JSON command, and the `cgi_param_parse` function is responsible for parsing the parameters specific to the requested API command.
*   The `cgi_param_parse` function retrieves the `param` element from the JSON structure and passes it to the API-specific parameter parser.
*   The API-specific parameter parser code assumes the `param` field is a JSON object and attempts to access it with the subscription operator, which causes the crash if it's not a JSON object.
*   The report includes a vulnerable code snippet highlighting the assert condition: `__assert(s_type__==_nullValue_||_type__==_o_004e3084...`

**Example Attack Scenario:**

An attacker can send the following crafted HTTP POST request:

```
curl --request POST \
     --data "[{\"cmd\": \"SetAutoUpgrade\",\"action\": 0,\"param\":  \"\"}]" \
     http://<CAMERA_IP>/cgi-bin/api.cgi\?cmd\=SetAutoUpgrade&token\=<SESSION_TOKEN>
```

This request will cause the `cgiserver.cgi` to crash, leading to the device reboot.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report lists a series of related CVEs (CVE-2021-44354 to CVE-2021-44419) which are all related to the same type of vulnerability in different API calls.
