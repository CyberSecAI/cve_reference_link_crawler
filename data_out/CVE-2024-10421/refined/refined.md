Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection found in the `\admin\overtime_row.php` file of the SourceCodester Attendance and Payroll System v1.0.
*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `id` parameter, which is used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This allows an attacker to insert malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter, which will then be executed by the database server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The description states that the vulnerability "can be launched remotely." This suggests that a remote attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Data Breach:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, payroll information, and attendance records.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a web request to the `\admin\overtime_row.php` file, specifically manipulating the `id` parameter in the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No specific user authentication is explicitly mentioned, which implies that the vulnerability can potentially be exploited by unauthenticated users, or by using low privilege credentials if required.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious payloads to be inserted into the `id` parameter

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "serious".
