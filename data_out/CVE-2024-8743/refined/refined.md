Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8743

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks on allowed file types when uploading files via the "Bit File Manager" plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not adequately restrict the upload of potentially harmful file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows the upload of `.css` and `.js` files, which are executable in a web browser context.
- **Insufficient File Type Validation:**  The plugin fails to properly validate and restrict file uploads based on their MIME types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious `.js` or `.css` files, attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the website, leading to XSS attacks. This allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful exploitation of XSS can be leveraged to perform various malicious actions, potentially leading to further compromise of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Functionality:** Attackers exploit the file upload feature of the plugin.
- **MIME Type Bypass:** The plugin fails to adequately validate file uploads based on their MIME types, allowing attackers to bypass any existing restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Subscriber"-level access.
- **Permissions:** The attacker needs to have the necessary file management permissions granted by an administrator.
- **Access to File Manager Functionality**: The user must have access to the file upload feature within the plugin.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 6.5.7 of the "Bit File Manager" plugin.
- Version 6.5.8 of the plugin includes a fix for this issue.
- The fix includes restricting javascript and css file types for shortcodes and allows the admin to allow from permission settings if required.
- The plugin developers have updated the plugin to address this vulnerability which involves changes in `FileManagerController.php`, `PermissionsController.php` and `PermissionsProvider.php` to add  `javascript`, `css` to the list of allowed file types to be managed by admin.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.8 which is medium.
- The Wordfence vulnerability database provides detailed information about the vulnerability including a link to the plugin's changeset that addresses it, and links to CVE.
