*   This advisory confirms that `dev-db/mysql` versions prior to `5.6.34` are affected by this vulnerability.
*   The Gentoo advisory indicates the vulnerability could lead to the "remote execution of arbitrary code" but this is not specific to CVE-2016-5635, as it groups several vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory indicates that "Attackers could execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and impact availability via unspecified vectors."
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Summary**

The Oracle advisory does not provide details of the vulnerability itself, but its location within the MySQL audit functionality. The vulnerability is exploitable via network access, requires low complexity and no specific privileges, but impact on confidentiality, integrity or availability are unclear. Gentoo's advisory, which bundles several MySQL CVEs, indicates that remote code execution is possible in MySQL, however it does not clearly link this exploit to the CVE-2016-5635. The information about this CVE from the document is limited.

The Gentoo advisory provides more details about the overall severity of the group of vulnerabilities, but it is not specifically about CVE-2016-5635.
