Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-313313: Denial of Service Vulnerability in the FTP Server of Nucleus RTOS

| Publication Date: | 2022-10-11 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2023-02-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.2 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 |

SUMMARY

The FTP server of the networking component (Nucleus NET) in Nucleus Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) does not properly release memory resources that were reserved for incomplete connection attempts by FTP clients. This could allow a remote attacker to generate a denial of service condition on devices that incorporate a vulnerable version of the FTP server.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

| Affected Product and Versions | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| Nucleus NET for Nucleus PLUS V1  All versions < V5.2a | Update to V5.2a as available in Nucleus PLUS V1.15 and apply the patch "v2022.11"  <https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/852852095/>   See further recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#mitigations-section) |
| Nucleus NET for Nucleus PLUS V2  All versions < V5.4 | Update to V5.4 as available in Nucleus PLUS V2.1f and apply the patch "v2022.11"  <https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/852852095/>   See further recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#mitigations-section) |
| Nucleus ReadyStart V3 V2012  All versions < V2012.08.1 | Update to V2012.08.1 and apply the patch "v2022.11"  <https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/1009925838/>   See further recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#mitigations-section) |
| Nucleus ReadyStart V3 V2017  All versions < V2017.02.4 | Update to V2017.02.4 and apply the patch "2017.02.4\_patch\_CVE-2022-38371"  <https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/1009925838/>   See further recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#mitigations-section) |
| Nucleus Source Code  Versions including affected FTP server | Contact customer support to receive patch and update information   See further recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#mitigations-section) |

WORKAROUNDS
AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Configure `TCP_MAX_KEEPALIVES` to a lower value such as 3. Additionally, configure `TCP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL` and `TCP_KEEPALIVE_DELAY` be set to 3 seconds. Rebuild your application.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Nucleus NET module incorporates a wide range of standard-compliant networking
and communication protocols, drivers, and utilities to deliver full-featured
network support in any embedded device. The networking functionality is fully
integrated into the Nucleus RTOS ("Nucleus PLUS") and supports a variety of processors and MCUs.

Nucleus ReadyStart is a platform with integrated software IP, tools, and services
ideal for applications where a small footprint, deterministic performance, and small code size are essential.

Nucleus RTOS is a highly scalable micro-kernel based real-time operating system designed for
scalability and reliability in systems spanning the range of aerospace, industrial, and medical applications.
Since V3, Nucleus RTOS (incl. its modules, e.g. Nucleus NET) is an integral part of the Nucleus ReadyStart platform.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (<https://www.first.org/cvss/>). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
<https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-38371
The FTP server does not properly release memory resources that were reserved for incomplete connection attempts by FTP clients. This could allow a remote attacker to generate a denial of service condition on devices that incorporate a vulnerable version of the FTP server.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption |

Siemens thanks the following parties for their efforts:

* Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT for coordinated disclosure
* WAGO for reporting the vulnerability and coordination efforts

Nucleus RTOS is a highly scalable micro-kernel based real-time operating system designed for scalability
and reliability in systems spanning the range of aerospace, industrial, and medical applications. Since
V3, Nucleus RTOS (incl. its modules, e.g. Nucleus NET) is an integral part of the Nucleus ReadyStart
platform.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-38371

The FTP server does not properly release memory resources that were reserved for incomplete
connection attempts by FTP clients. This could allow a remote attacker to generate a denial of service
condition on devices that incorporate a vulnerable version of the FTP server.
