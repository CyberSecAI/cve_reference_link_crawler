Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies within the FTP server of the Nucleus RTOS (Real-Time Operating System). The FTP server fails to properly release memory resources allocated for incomplete connection attempts made by FTP clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The core issue is that memory resources are not properly released, leading to a resource exhaustion when incomplete connection attempts are made repeatedly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service condition. This is achieved by repeatedly making incomplete connection attempts to the FTP server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker can perform this attack remotely over the network using FTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the target device running the vulnerable FTP server.
*   **No Privileges Needed:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication or special privileges to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Siemens has released updates for some affected products.
*   Workarounds are suggested, such as configuring TCP keep-alive parameters to mitigate the vulnerability by reducing the window of opportunity for incomplete connections to exhaust resources.
*   Disabling the FTP service is recommended as a mitigation.
*  Affected products include Nucleus NET, Nucleus ReadyStart, and various APOGEE, TALON, and Desigo PXC/PXM products that use the vulnerable Nucleus RTOS.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 (High), and a CVSS v4.0 base score of 8.7 (High).
