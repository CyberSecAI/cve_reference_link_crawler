Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-20330:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper memory management within the Snort 2 and Snort 3 TCP and UDP detection engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software when processing specific TCP or UDP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper memory management leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause memory corruption in the Snort detection engine.
- This corruption can lead to the unexpected restart of the Snort detection engine.
- Repeated restarts of the Snort detection engine result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by dropping traffic that is processed by the Snort engine.
- The device itself remains manageable over the network, but traffic inspection is disrupted.
- Once memory is corrupted, it remains corrupted until a manual reload of the appliance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted TCP or UDP packets through a device using the vulnerable Snort detection engine.
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the targeted Firepower 2100 appliance.
- No authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances running a vulnerable version of Cisco FTD Software that has a Snort intrusion policy configured.
- Both Snort 2 and Snort 3 are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in both Snort 2 and Snort 3, depending on the configured version on the FTD appliance.
- No workarounds are available.
- Fixed software updates are available from Cisco.
