Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `account` parameter in the `delete-account.php` endpoint. This allows untrusted data to be directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw stemming from the lack of input validation and sanitization in the `delete-account.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application. This can lead to:
  - **Information Disclosure:** The provided exploit demonstrates an attacker's ability to extract data from the database, including the database username.
  - **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
  - **Full Database Compromise:** With sufficient privileges and knowledge of the database structure, an attacker may gain full control over the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/endpoint/delete-account.php` endpoint.
- **`account` Parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is injected into the `account` parameter of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `delete-account.php` endpoint and the parameter being used for injection.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code directly concatenates the `account` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- The provided payload uses a `GTID_SUBSET` function to extract the database username.
- The exploit can be automated using tools like sqlmap.
- The application is identified as "SourceCodester Accounts Manager App 1.0".
- The vulnerable file is located at "endpoint/delete-account.php".
