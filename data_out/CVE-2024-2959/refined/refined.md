- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `savePricingTable()` function within the SVS Pricing Tables plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can create and edit pricing tables.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can create a forged request and trick a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link, which triggers the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious request and trick a site administrator into executing it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
