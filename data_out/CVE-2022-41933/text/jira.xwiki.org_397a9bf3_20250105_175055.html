#### Description

Reproduction steps:

* Create a subwiki with "local and global users" (or local users only)
* Create a user on that subwiki with an email address
* Go to the login page of the wiki and click on "forgot password"
* Insert the username of the user and submit the form

Expected result:

* a mail is sent to perform the reset password operation

Obtained result:

* no mail is sent at all

Note that the process works if the entered user is a main wiki user even accessed from subwiki. The root cause of the bug is that the form is accessed using this kind of URL:

<http://localhost:8080/xwiki/authenticate/reset> which doesn't provide any information about the subwiki.
