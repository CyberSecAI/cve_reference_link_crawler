  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The TOTOLINK A860R router firmware contains a hardcoded root password.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain root access to the device by using the hardcoded password, allowing them to control the device, access network traffic, and potentially launch further attacks within the network.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network access to the device's login interface (likely SSH or telnet).",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to reach the device's login interface, either locally (if on the same network) or remotely if the interface is exposed to the internet. The attacker also needs knowledge of the hardcoded password 'cs2012'."
