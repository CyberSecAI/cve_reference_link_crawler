The provided content relates to CVE-2021-4329.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `operations` object within the `json-logic-js` library was handled. Specifically, it was possible to pass a string containing a dot-separated path (e.g., `__proto__.polluted`) as an operation to the `apply` function. This allowed an attacker to access and modify properties of the `Object.prototype` through the `operations` object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution: An attacker can modify properties of `Object.prototype`, which can affect all objects in the JavaScript environment.
- Unrestricted access to properties via dot notation: The code didn't properly validate the input operation names before accessing them in `operations`, allowing traversal into the prototype chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By polluting the prototype, an attacker could potentially cause the application to behave unexpectedly or execute malicious code. The provided text specifically mentions that "The operations object could be exploited to run arbitrary code"
- Denial of service: If critical parts of `Object.prototype` are modified, it could lead to application crashes or incorrect behaviour.
- Data modification: By modifying properties of the prototype, it could affect the behaviour of the application logic and potentially lead to data manipulation or security breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- Input manipulation: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted JSON logic payload containing the malicious operation string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the JSON logic payload that the application processes.
- No specific privileges are mentioned; the attack can be performed if an attacker is able to supply the json logic input to the vulnerable function.
