I use this plugin frequently. Thank you for developing a helpful plugin. The easy-to-understand UI for non-developers has saved a lot of people.I register my Contact Form 7 entries into Custom Field Suite and it is really useful.When the number of items in the loop exceeds about 200, it seems that no more data can be saved, but there is no particular inconvenience.

We were looking for an alternative to ACF Pro since it incurs the cost for the clients and
We found this gem of a plugin
and have been using it since then. Though it has limitations but still is very useful.
9/10 as a replacement to ACF Pro

The plugin is worthy of attention, it copes with certain tasks better than ACF

At the same time that it is simple, it is very powerful and helps a lot in development, especially with the field repeater.
Thanks to the developer.
