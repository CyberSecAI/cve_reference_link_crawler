{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) due to a combination of two bugs in the CRS Drupal rule exclusion package. Specifically, a missing phase 1 skip in the Drupal rule exclusion package and three rules that disable request body scanning for specific requests, coupled with the way servers process trailing pathname information.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing Phase 1 skip in Drupal Rule Exclusion Package",
      "Overly permissive request body scanning disabling rules in Drupal RE",
      "Inconsistent handling of URI path and path info between WAF and application servers",
      "Lack of comprehensive code review and testing processes"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can bypass the WAF by sending a request with a crafted URI that includes path info, which the WAF interprets as a Drupal request and disables request body inspection. The backend application, however, may ignore the path info and process the request without the body being scanned, thus allowing malicious payloads to pass undetected.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP request, specifically one with trailing pathname information, is sent to the server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application protected by the WAF. No specific position is mentioned other than being able to reach the web application.",
     "additional_details": "The issue is caused by the Drupal RE rules disabling request body scanning based on a regular expression matching against the URI, combined with the fact that some servers may accept path info which is then discarded by the application logic. This creates a discrepancy between what the WAF sees and what the application processes, allowing request body bypass if the crafted URI matches the rules for specific Drupal admin requests. The vulnerability is not limited to Drupal installations, but affects all CRS installations that use the affected rule exclusion packages. The vulnerability has existed since 2017."
