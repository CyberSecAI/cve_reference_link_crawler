Package        : modsecurity-crs
Version        : 3.2.3-0+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16384 CVE-2020-22669 CVE-2021-35368 CVE-2022-39955
                 CVE-2022-39956 CVE-2022-39957 CVE-2022-39958
Debian Bug     : 924352 992000 1021137

Multiple issues were found in modsecurity-crs, a set of generic attack
detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application
firewalls, which allows remote attackers to bypass the web applications
firewall.

If you are using modsecurity-crs with apache2 / libapache2-modsecurity, please
make sure to review your modsecurity configuration, usually
/etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf, against the updated recommended
configration, available in /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended:
Some of the changes to the recommended rules are required to avoid WAF bypasses
in certain circumstances.

Please note that CVE-2022-39956 requires an updated modsecurity-apache packge,
which has been previously uploaded to buster-security, see Debian LTS Advisory
DLA-3283-1 for details.

If you are using some other solution in connection with the
modsecurity-ruleset, for example one that it is using libmodsecurity3, your
solution might error out with an error message like "Error creating rule:
Unknown variable: MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS". In this case you can disable the
mitigation for CVE-2022-29956 by removing the rule file
REQUEST-922-MULTIPART-ATTACK.conf.  However, be aware that this will disable
the protection and could allow attackers to bypass your Web Application
Firewall.

There is no package in Debian which depends on libmodsecurity3, so if you are
only using software which is available from Debian, you are not affected by
this limitation.

Kudos to @airween for the support and help while perparing the update.

CVE-2018-16384

    A SQL injection bypass (aka PL1 bypass) exists in OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule
    Set (owasp-modsecurity-crs) through v3.1.0-rc3 via {`a`b} where a is a special
    function name (such as "if") and b is the SQL statement to be executed.

CVE-2020-22669

    Modsecurity owasp-modsecurity-crs 3.2.0 (Paranoia level at PL1) has a SQL
    injection bypass vulnerability. Attackers can use the comment characters and
    variable assignments in the SQL syntax to bypass Modsecurity WAF protection and
    implement SQL injection attacks on Web applications.

CVE-2022-39955

    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set
    bypass by submitting a specially crafted HTTP Content-Type header field that
    indicates multiple character encoding schemes. A vulnerable back-end can
    potentially be exploited by declaring multiple Content-Type "charset" names and
    therefore bypassing the configurable CRS Content-Type header "charset" allow
    list. An encoded payload can bypass CRS detection this way and may then be
    decoded by the backend. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected,
    as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and
    users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.

CVE-2022-39956

    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set
    bypass for HTTP multipart requests by submitting a payload that uses a
    character encoding scheme via the Content-Type or the deprecated
    Content-Transfer-Encoding multipart MIME header fields that will not be decoded
    and inspected by the web application firewall engine and the rule set. The
    multipart payload will therefore bypass detection. A vulnerable backend that
    supports these encoding schemes can potentially be exploited. The legacy CRS
    versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported
    versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised upgrade to 3.2.2
    and 3.3.3 respectively. The mitigation against these vulnerabilities depends on
    the installation of the latest ModSecurity version (v2.9.6 / v3.0.8).

CVE-2022-39957

    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body
    bypass. A client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing an optional
    "charset" parameter in order to receive the response in an encoded form.
    Depending on the "charset", this response can not be decoded by the web
    application firewall. A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily
    be detected, may therefore bypass detection. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and
    3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and
    3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3
    respectively.

CVE-2022-39958

    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body bypass
    to sequentially exfiltrate small and undetectable sections of data by
    repeatedly submitting an HTTP Range header field with a small byte range. A
    restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected, may be
    exfiltrated from the backend, despite being protected by a web application
    firewall that uses CRS. Short subsections of a restricted resource may bypass
    pattern matching techniques and allow undetected access. The legacy CRS
    versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported
    versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2
    and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRS paranoia level of 3 or higher.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.3-0+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your modsecurity-crs packages.

# CVE-2021-35368 - CRS Request Body Bypass (Update)

June 30, 2021
By
[Christian Folini](https://www.twitter.com/ChrFolini "Visit Christian Folini on Twitter")
(netnea)

There is a severe security issue in our rule set. It has been present since the release of CRS 3.1.0 and was recently brought to our attention.

Here is the official advisory that we are also publishing as CVE-2021-35368 via MITRE (as usual, MITRE will take a few days until they publish this).

### Offical Advisory for CVE-2021-35368

**The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a request body bypass that abuses trailing pathname information. A backend vulnerability can thus be exploited despite being protected with the CRS Web Application Firewall rule set when an application server accepts additional path info as part of the request URI. All known CRS installations that offer the predefined CRS rule exclusion packages are affected. This applies to end-of-life CRS versions 3.0.x, 3.1.0, 3.1.1 as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.0 and 3.3.0. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.1.2, 3.2.1 and 3.3.2 respectively.**

### Link to releases, Release Notes, etc.

* [CRS v3.3.2 release](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v3.3.2) / [CHANGES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/v3.3.2/CHANGES)
* [CRS v3.2.1 release](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v3.2.1) / [CHANGES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/v3.2/master/CHANGES)
* [CRS v3.1.2 release](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v3.1.2) / [CHANGES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/v3.1/master/CHANGES)

Please note that [CRS 3.3.1 was never released](https://coreruleset.org/20210302/disabling-request-body-access-in-modsecurity-3-leads-to-complete-bypass/). We started with the release process, but we stopped after encountering severe problems with the first release candidate. CRS 3.3.2 builds on 3.3.0 again.

The Daily Swig has also [covers this vulnerability in an article](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/waf-bypass-severe-owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set-bug-was-present-for-several-years).

### CVSS Score (8.0 or higher)

It is tricky to assign a CVSS score to a bypass when exploitability depends on backend settings and weaknesses on the backend. If the backend is broken and configured with the correct trailing pathname information setting (more on that further down below), then anything is possible. If the backend looks into the trailing path info as it should, then you are on the safe side.

So depending on the backend, the CVSS is very high, certainly 8.0 or even higher.

### The Vulnerability in Detail

First, let’s explain what trailing pathname information is.

Here is a simple URI path used by a PHP server:

```
/cms/index.php

```

This path does not have any trailing pathname information.

Now look at this:

```
/cms/index.php/admin/content

```

Here, */admin/content* is the trailing pathname information, short: path info. PHP will execute the code in */cms/index.php* and decide on the exact behavior based on the path info.

Very often, servers attempt to beautify the path as follows:

```
/cms/admin/content

```

Here, the */index.php* is hidden and the path info is again */admin/content*. If you are on the backend, you can make that distinction. But for the web application firewall in front, it’s all part of the path. In fact, ModSecurity and CRS are not making the distinction between path and path info at all unless they run on the webserver.

With that being clear, let’s look at the vulnerability.

CRS introduced rule exclusion packages in 3.1.0, short REs. REs are ModSecurity rules that are loaded, but disabled by default. Disabling works via a skip mechanism that is being applied unless you set a variable that tells ModSec you want to execute the REs in question.

As you probably know, ModSecurity runs in multiple phases. The request rules happen in phase 1 and in phase 2. It’s like the rule set would be executed twice, once for the phase 1 rules, and once for the phase 2 rules. So if you want to skip a part of the rule set - the REs! - then you need to define a skip for phase 1 and a separate skip for phase 2. All the REs do that. Well, all the REs with one exception: The Drupal RE package in REQUEST-903.9001-DRUPAL-EXCLUSION-RULES.conf lacks the skip for phase 1. This is a bug that sadly evaded our review process, which was still maturing around the 3.1 release stage.

This results in a situation where the Drupal REs in phase 1 are always active, whether you have enabled them or not.

However, if your installation comes without the RE files or this particular RE, then you are on the safe side. In fact, many of the commercial CRS offerings do not include REs.

Okay, so far we are in a situation where too many rules are executed which brings a minimal performance impact. 3-4 percent or so, I guess. But it’s getting worse. The problem is that on top of this blunder, three Drupal RE rules are playing with fire: They *disable request body scanning* for a handful of specific requests: 9001180, 9001182 and 9001184. There is a comment in the code that reads “Extensive checks make sure these uploads are really legitimate.” Extensive: yes, comprehensive: no.

We think it’s a good idea to install your software into a sub-folder. Like installing Drupal under */cms*, since this will hide it from a lot of security scanners that do not even follow redirects. However, this also leads to a situation where CRS won’t know your exact installation path. That’s why the extensive tests quoted in the comment can not be exact. CRS opted for anchoring the pattern at the end like this regular expression: */admin/content/assets/add/[a-z]+$*. The URI path starts with anything and ends with this pattern.

As we have seen above, this could be a path info in a specific URI. If an application outside Drupal looks at the path info, then this would result in a 404 or some other error. However, if the application ignores the path info, then it will simply execute the request with its base URI path. CRS in front of the application can not know this, so it has to assume it’s a single URI path and interprets it accordingly, assumes it’s facing a request to Drupal *content->assets* and disables request body access. That means the request will pass without the request body being inspected by the WAF. But when the backend receives the request, it will throw away the path info and we have a WAF Bypass!

This is because the WAF and the application don’t have the same perception of the URI and they act differently based on the request. It’s a typical web application firewall problem, but here it is impacting us in an exemplary way.

Why do the Drupal REs disable the rule engine anyways? All the other REs are more conservative in their approach. Honestly, we do not remember. It probably has to do with a lack of time and with a lack of review.

When attempting to fix this double shortcoming, we tried to reproduce the requests that the rules 9001180, 9001182 and 9001184 address. However, we failed. Despite clicking around in Drupal for hours, we could not issue a request meeting the regular expressions of said rules. It is therefore very likely the requests are aimed at a particular Drupal module and are not standard Drupal requests. It could be a popular module, but our Drupal RE actually only targets the Drupal core installation, so it is possible that we saw false positives on an installation that included a few rare modules and we wanted to get rid of it quickly when we were planning to release the first batch of rule exclusions.

### The Fix

Given we can not reproduce the requests behind 9001180, 9001182 and 9001184, we do not know the individual false positives that these rules try to avoid anymore. We can not continue switching off the request body access either, so removing these rule exclusions seems like the best option as of this writing.

For Drupal users, this might mean that you install the update and face new false positives. If that’s the case, you will need to tune them away yourself. If you happen to encounter these URIs on your Drupal installation and you find false positives that you connect to these URIs, then please get in touch via our GitHub issues page; we would be really interested in more information here.

So rules 9001180, 9001182 and 9001184 are being removed. And we are adding a phase 1 skip. We try to bring the Drupal REs in sync with the other REs. So we shift the existing rule 9001000 to phase 1 and add a new rule 9001001 in phase 2 to perform the RE skip in phase 2.

**Update:** We are not releasing an update for the 3.0.x release line that has been EOL for several years. If you are stuck on version 3.0 and you do not need the Drupal rule exclusions, then simply remove the file **`REQUEST-903.9001-DRUPAL-EXCLUSION-RULES.conf`**. If you do need them, then simply copy the [Drupal rule exclusion file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/v3.3/master/rules/REQUEST-903.9001-DRUPAL-EXCLUSION-RULES.conf) from the new version over your old file.

### A Word About CRS Rule Exclusions

Any Web Application Firewall worth its investment comes with false positives (FPs) for certain requests. If it does not, then it’s probably because it lacks teeth. At CRS, we try to fight FPs with multiple approaches. Improving the detection patterns is an obvious one. Rule exclusion packages are another one. With an RE we accept that some rules are being triggered by a certain application. We group these rules together and assemble a configuration that disables these rules from being executed for this application or for certain parameters on certains URIs of the application. That’s what we call a rule exclusion package.

In CRS v3.3, we included REs for

* Drupal
* WordPress
* Nextcloud / Owncloud
* Dokuwiki
* CPanel
* Xenforo

and more of them are in the making for the next release.

When we introduced REs with 3.1, we kind of hoped that the communities and vendors behind these tools would embrace the REs and help us with maintenance, maybe help to extend them to modules, etc. Ideally, other communities would then get in touch and ask how they can contribute REs for their software and more and more traction would build up.

Yet it seems, that’s all been wet dreams of open source developers. Meanwhile we are aware that the REs are somewhat outdated and still very limited. Yet very few contributions happen and we are struggling to maintain the ones we have, especially when nobody in the CRS development team uses the software in question. Necessary reviews of existing REs are not happening regularly either, so the situation is unsatisfying and we need to do something about this.

### Indicators of Compromise

We are are not aware of this weakness being exploited in the wild. You should be able to find out for yourself by checking for the following patterns in your logfiles.

If you are not running Drupal, yet you see successful HTTP status codes for the following URI paths, then you might be facing a successful exploit:

* `/admin/content/assets/add/`
* `/admin/content/assets/manage/`
* `/file/ajax/field_asset_`

If you are able to confirm an attack (that is the requests above against non-Drupal installations) regardless of success or not, then we would be very interested to learn about it.

### Thanks

The CRS team would like to thank Andrew Howe from Loadbalancer.org for bringing this weakness to our attention. Andrew has been very helpful discussing the impact and fix for this vulnerability and we hope to work with him in the future.

Meanwhile Andrew has also written a separate [blog post](https://www.loadbalancer.org/blog/announcing-cve-2021-35368-owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set-bypass/) about this vulnerability.

# OWASP CRS

**The 1st Line of Defense Against Web Application Attacks**

The OWASP CRS is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with [ModSecurity](https://modsecurity.org/) or compatible web application firewalls. It aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), with a minimum of false alerts. CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, Local File Inclusion, etc.

Years-old WAF bypass flaw was discovered in June

![Lessons learned: How a severe vulnerability in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set sparked much-needed change](/cms/images/d0/f7/440d-article-211105-modsec-body-text.png "Image: At-Scene / Shutterstock")

A severe [vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities) present in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) for several years was a “bang on the ear” for the project's maintainers, who have outlined steps to improve its security.

The ModSec team reported that a complete rule set bypass (CVE-2021-35368) had been discovered in June 2021. The critical bug that had been present in the software for at least four years.

As [previously reported](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/waf-bypass-severe-owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set-bug-was-present-for-several-years) by The Daily Swig, the vulnerability bypassed the security protections offered by the in-built CRS web application firewall (WAF), meaning that malicious request body payloads could be smuggled through without being inspected.

The issue, which was introduced in code changes 2017, has since been remediated.

However, to help reduce the likelihood of another high-impact bug slipping through the net, the CRS maintainers have implemented new practices, guidelines, and a [bug bounty](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bug-bounty) program to further secure the technology.

### A chance for growth

Speaking to The Daily Swig, OWASP CRS co-lead Christian Folini said that the incident was “one of the biggest bangs on the ear” for him.

He explained: “It was clearly my personal fault. I had introduced these two bugs right after our new team had taken over the dormant project in 2016. The fix was easy enough, yet I felt like hiding under a rock.”

BACKGROUND [WAF bypass: ‘Severe’ OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set bug was present for several years](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/waf-bypass-severe-owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set-bug-was-present-for-several-years)

The [team met in Switzerland last week](https://coreruleset.org/20211101/crs-developer-retreat-2021/) to formulate a plan to “improve set up and procedures”, said Folini, who admitted that the incident was an “embarrassment”.

Folini said: “We started to look at it as a chance for growth and development. Therefore, we made it a focus theme for our first CRS developer retreat – how can we prevent merging bugs? And, if we carry them, how do we detect them in our rules?”

### Beyond automated testing

Folini said that the CRS team has been slowly expanding its [DevOps](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/devops) practices “for several years” since they took over in 2016.

However, the project is in need of “a comprehensive [application security](/burp/application-security-testing) program that goes beyond automatic testing”, according to Folini.

Addressing the issue, he told The Daily Swig that the CRS team has implemented a list of changes that will foster a more proactive approach to security.

> “We ran a workshop at our retreat and tried to come up with various measures that would form several layers of defense against any failures in our rule set. Eventually we settled on four changes:
>
> - Rule exclusion packages will become plugins
>
> - We will forbid certain constructs/directives from the rule set
>
> - We will prepare a formal checklist to review every rule, namely new ones
>
> - We will launch a bug bounty program.”

### Shrinking the attack surface

Folini explained that the bypass vulnerability was hidden in one of the rule exclusion packages, which are distributed together with the rule set.

“Even an inactive rule exclusion package could cripple the entire rule set,” he said.

“So, we want to transform these packages into plugins, leveraging the new plugin functionality that we are going to introduce with our next major release. Plugins are not installed by default, so this measure will reduce our attack surface.”

[Read more of the latest security vulnerability news](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities)

Folini told The Daily Swig that the bypass was only possible because a bad rule used a “very powerful” construct to disable request body access under certain conditions.

“What we did not realize was that an attacker could meet these conditions by abusing the PATH\_INFO part of the request URI,” he continued.

“If we forbid this and similarly powerful directives, we reduce the impact of future bugs, so this is a risk limiting measure.”

Folini also said that by introducing a formal checklist and a bug bounty program, code can be extensively reviewed, both internally and externally.

This plan does, however, contain a caveat: In order to be able to pay such bounties, the project will need to attract more sponsors.

### Lessons learned

Despite the major security headache caused by the [WAF](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/waf) bypass vulnerability, Folini is optimistic that the lessons learned will spark much-needed change.

“Nobody likes to look like an idiot in public,” he admitted. “But it is important to take the bull by the horns.

“Going out, writing a detailed advisory, informing the big integrators directly (in advance), responding to questions from the community and reviewing your own policies and procedures are all crucial steps if you want to grow and improve.

“The whole affair also strengthened the ties within the team. We overcame this together and we know we can trust each other even when we’re in deep trouble and that’s very reassuring.

“So ultimately, I think it was a positive experience and we trust that the community appreciates how we handled this severe incident. So, it looks like we’re doing the right thing here.”

High-scoring bug went unnoticed due to time and money constraints

![A vulnerability in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) project that could allow attackers to bypass security mechanisms was present for several years](/cms/images/43/9c/ebe2-article-210705-waf-body-text.jpg "Image: KLSS / Shutterstock")

A [vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities) in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) project that could allow attackers to bypass security mechanisms was present for several years, the maintainers have admitted.

The bug – tracked as CVE-2021-35368 – bypasses the security protections offered by the in-built CRS web application firewall (WAF), an advisory warns.

This means that malicious request body payloads are able to pass the rule set without being inspected, due to a combination of two bugs in the CRS Drupal rule exclusion package.

The vulnerability is not limited to Drupal installations, however, but is present in every CRS installation that includes these rule exclusions – regardless of whether they are enabled or not.

### Backend weaknesses exposed

The risk to websites depends on their ModSecurity configuration, [a write-up details](https://coreruleset.org/20210630/cve-2021-35368-crs-request-body-bypass/).

“If the backend is broken and configured with the correct trailing pathname information setting… then anything is possible. If the backend looks into the trailing path info as it should, then you are on the safe side,” it reads.

Christian Folini, co-lead of the volunteer-led Core Rule Set project, told The Daily Swig that the flaw has “been around for several years”.

“When we did the early rule exclusion packages in 2016 and 2017 we were not really used to the rule writing techniques that we had to employ,” Folini explained.

“Also [there were] no coding guidelines. And as we [have come] to realize now, nobody has really reviewed this part of the code in the meantime, probably also thanks to the misconception that bugs within the rule exclusion packages would have limited impact since they are disabled by default.

“In retrospect, the failure is obvious. The important part now is learning our lesson and adopting our [development](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/secure-development) and review process to avoid such failures in the future.”

### A deeper look

The flaw was discovered and reported by Andrew Howe from Loadbalancer.org, who reviewed the ModSecurity engine last year, Folini said.

Howe reported the two bugs in the CRS in June. All known CRS installations that offer the predefined CRS rule exclusion packages are affected. This also applies to end-of-life CRS versions 3.0.x, 3.1.0, 3.1.1, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.0 and 3.3.0.

Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.1.2, 3.2.1, and 3.3.2, respectively.

Discussing the challenges faced by a volunteer-led project such as CRS, Folini pinpointed a lack of [financial](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/financial) support as a key barrier.

Folini said: “[Open source](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/open-source-software) is not inherently more secure than closed source – it just means that people can look at the code. Yet the security advantage can only play out when people actually do look at the code, like Andrew Howe did.

“If we have these reviews, then the inherent transparency of an open source project will bring an advantage over traditional software, namely in the security domain where users really want to see what is going deep down in their software.

“Open source projects also tend to be more open about their shortcomings so they are often able to build up more trust and confidence with their user base. A commercial project is often tempted to avoid bad press by keeping a problem under the rug, or hiding a fix in the changelog.”

MUST READ [Moving security forward by looking back](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/moving-security-forward-by-looking-back)

Conducting these reviews is challenging, however, since the project does not have any funds to pay people for their time.

“You could say we’re in a bit of Heartbleed situation,” said Folini, referring to [the 2014 discovery of an implementation flaw](https://heartbleed.com/) in the widely used OpenSSL cryptographic software library, which went unnoticed due (in part) to a lack of financial support.

“CRS is running on over 100 Tbit/s of traffic and most content delivery networks and [cloud providers](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cloud-security) have a commercial offering where they charge for CRS, yet most of them fail to contribute back to our project so far,” he explained.

Folini said that the project maintainers have contacted the [organizations](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/organizations) using CRS, and are calling for help from the “big players”.

“Convincing a commercial company from sponsoring something they can get for free is a hard sell,” he explained.

“Yet we have subscribed the first real sponsors in 2021 and I hope that the big players will join them.

“We have a lot of plans where to take our project, yet many of them are on hold until we find the money and resources to implement them.”
