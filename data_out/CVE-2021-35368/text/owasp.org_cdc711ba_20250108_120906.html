# OWASP CRS

**The 1st Line of Defense Against Web Application Attacks**

The OWASP CRS is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with [ModSecurity](https://modsecurity.org/) or compatible web application firewalls. It aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), with a minimum of false alerts. CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, Local File Inclusion, etc.
