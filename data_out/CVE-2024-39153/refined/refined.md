- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The idccms V1.35 application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a user to delete news articles, as demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept. Other administrative actions are also likely vulnerable to this kind of attack.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page with a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, will execute an unwanted action on the vulnerable web application. This can be achieved by tricking the user into visiting the attacker's page through various means such as phishing emails or malicious links.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a webpage they control. The user needs to be authenticated with the idccms application.
