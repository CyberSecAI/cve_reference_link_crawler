| CVE-2024-5102 |  |
| --- | --- |
| Severity/CVSSv4.0 | Severity: High Score:7.3 Vector: CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H |
| References | https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5102 |
| Impact | Escalation of privelage |
| Description | A sym-linked file accessed via the repair function in Avast Antivirus <24.2 on Windows may allow user to elevate privilege to delete arbitrary files or run processes as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerability exists within the "Repair" (settings -> troubleshooting -> repair) feature, which attempts to delete a file in the current user's AppData directory as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. A low-privileged user can make a pseudo-symlink and a junction folder and point to a file on the system. This can provide a low-privileged user an Elevation of Privilege to win a race-condition which will re-create the system files and make Windows callback to a specially-crafted file which could be used to launch a privileged shell instance. This issue affects Avast Antivirus prior to 24.2. |
