In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix a possible null pointer dereference

In function lpfc_xcvr_data_show, the memory allocation with kmalloc might
fail, thereby making rdp_context a null pointer. In the following context
and functions that use this pointer, there are dereferencing operations,
leading to null pointer dereference.

To fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added. If it is null,
use scnprintf to notify the user and return len.
