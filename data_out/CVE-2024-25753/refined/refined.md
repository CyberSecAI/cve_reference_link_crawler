- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `formSetDeviceName` function reads a user-provided parameter "devName" without any length check, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution (RCE) can be achieved.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted request to the vulnerable page, an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable device.
