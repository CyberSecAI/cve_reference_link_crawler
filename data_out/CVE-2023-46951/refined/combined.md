| For anyone stumbling across this, recent versions of sidekiq already protect against this (at least the trivial cases I could quickly come up with myself). The CSP is more restrictive since version [7.2.0](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/Changes.md#720), [sidekiq/sidekiq#6074](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/pull/6074), released October 31, 2023.  [@mhenrixon](https://github.com/mhenrixon) would you mind creating/publishing a CVE so that the ecosystem can be properly be notified of this issue? You should be able to do that directly through GitHub with their security advisories. This issue from sidekiq itself should serve as a pretty good base I think [GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35 "GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35"), basically the same thing. |

| I'm fortunate enough to never have had to deal with this from this side myself yet. I did a quick search beforehand, and apparently you are able to directly request one from GitHub itself. There are other entities that can assign a CVE but to be honest that all seems a bit complicated to me.  I'm mostly basing this off of what I read at <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory>. This is also relevant <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory#requesting-a-cve-identification-number-optional>  For you, this should be <https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/security/advisories/new>. Fill that out, using the sidekiq advisory as a template, request a CVE *somewhere* on that advisory after submitting, and GitHub should take care of the rest. When all that is done (or somewhere inbetween, I don't think it matters much since the fix is already public) you can publish the advisory.  Sorry that I can't be of more use here, I'm usually just consuming these. |

| If I'm understanding this correctly...  We have already upgraded past the fix for sidekiq, as we are currently on sidekiq v7.1.6, and IIRC it was fixed in sidekiq v7.0.8. But we are on an old version of sidekiq-unique-jobs (upgrading now), and thus still had the vulnerability listed in this issue, I presume.  Does that make any sense? Is a fix for this gem not needed if we have already upgraded sidekiq? If not, then this gem needs its own separate CVE. |

| If you are on `sidekiq` below version 7.2.0 and don't have a version of `sidekiq-unique-jobs` with this fix then you are vulnerable.  The change in 7.0.8 was for a similar XSS vulnerability like here, a fix in `sidekiq` doesn't fix it in `sidekiq-unique-jobs`. The change in `sidekiq` 7.2.0 was a preventive measure for similar problems, not in response to an actual issue and wasn't backported.  I agree that a CVE here would be necessary. It's not a problem if you are on latest `sidekiq` but like someone already mentioned they are on sidekiq 6.X which wasn't vulnerable to the original issue in sidekiq (and as such doesn't have the defensive fix) but does have the problem this PR fixed (as such the desire for a backport of this).  Even though everyone should have the admin dashboard behind a constraint, knowledge that the dashboard exists and getting a user to click a malicious link is good enough for exploitation. |

| I tried. Looks like [@mhenrixon](https://github.com/mhenrixon) is the hero we need, unless another collaborator / maintainer has access.  👉 🚨 <https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/security/advisories/new> 🚨 👈  Even though everyone should have the admin dashboard behind a constraint, knowledge that the dashboard exists and getting a user to click a malicious link is good enough for exploitation.  This is an important note. Social hacking, where an attacker gets an authorized user to click on a malicious link, is often the easiest kind. |

Couldn't have done it without you guys! The repository will be more secure moving forward.

[**CVE-2023-46950**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46950) **/** [**CVE-2023-46951**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46951)

# **Reflected XSS in Sidekiq Unique Jobs UI**

**A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in sidekiq-unique-jobs version 8.0.6 (or earlier). We have reported this vulnerability to the developer, who addressed the issue and fixed the vulnerability in version 8.0.7.**

### **Description**

Sidekiq is used to manage and execute background jobs. Sidekiq Unique-Jobs is a gem that adds constraints to sidekiq jobs.

The following three filter functions where found to be susceptible to reflected cross-site scripting.

* /sidekiq/locks?filter={payload}
* /sidekiq/changelogs?filter={payload}
* /sidekiq/expiring\_locks?filter={payload}

In the following screenshot, the payload *“><script>alert(document.domain)</script>* was used in the ChangeLogs filter function to open a PoC pop-up that displays the current domain.

The locks functionality was found to be vulnerable in the following path:

```
/sidekiq/locks/{payload}
```

An example payload would be

```
“><img src=a onerror=alert(document.domain)>
```

This payload is injected into the HTML code in two places and therefore executed twice.

### **Assigned CVEs**

# XSS sidekiq-unique-jobs UI server vulnerability

High

[mhenrixon](/mhenrixon)
published
GHSA-cmh9-rx85-xj38
Feb 13, 2024

## Package

bundler

sidekiq-unique-jobs
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 8.0.7, < 7.1.33

## Patched versions

>= 8.0.7, >= 7.1.33

## Description

### Summary

Cross site scripting (XSS) potentially exposing cookies / sessions / localStorage, fixed by `sidekiq-unique-jobs` v8.0.7.

Specifically, this is a Reflected (Server-Side), Non-Self, Cross Site Scripting vulnerability, considered a ***P3*** on the BugCrowd [taxonomy](https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy) with the following categorization:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) > Reflected > Non-Self

It was initially thought there was a second vulnerability (RCE), but it was a false alarm. Injection is impossible with Redis:

> String escaping and NoSQL injection
>
> The Redis protocol has no concept of string escaping, so injection is impossible under normal circumstances using a normal client library. The protocol uses prefixed-length strings and is completely binary safe.

Ref: <https://redis.io/docs/management/security/>

**XSS Vulnerability**

Specially crafted `GET` request parameters handled by any of the following endpoints of `sidekiq-unique-jobs`' "admin" web UI, allow a super-user attacker, or an unwitting, but authorized, victim, who has received a disguised / crafted link, to successfully execute malicious code, which could potentially steal cookies, session data, or local storage data from the app the `sidekiq-unique-jobs` web UI is mounted in.

1. `/changelogs`
2. `/locks`
3. `/expiring_locks`

This means if your `sidekiq-unique-jobs` web UI is mounted at `/sidekiq`, the vulnerable paths are:

1. `/sidekiq/changelogs`
2. `/sidekiq/locks`
3. `/sidekiq/expiring_locks`

XSS vulnerability is an instance of [CAPEC-32: XSS Through HTTP Query Strings](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/32.html), which is related to [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html). In certain cases where it results in a server error with status 500, it could be considered a vector for uncontrolled resource consumption, given that errors can be much more resource intensive that normal requests, and thus [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) & [CWE-754](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html) may also be relevant.

### Details

Fix for the XSS vulnerability was released in `sidekiq-unique-jobs` [v8.0.7](https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/releases/tag/v8.0.7).

This is an analogous attack vector to that which affected `sidekiq` gem from version v7.0.4 to v7.0.7, and was given identifiers [GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35) & [CVE-2023-1892](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35).

The vulnerability in `sidekiq-unique-jobs`' was *not* fixed by `sidekiq` [v7.0.8](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/Changes.md#708), nor the more recent `sidekiq` [v7.2.0](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/Changes.md#720) releases; they are similar but unrelated, distinct vulnerabilities in adjacent projects.

Note [#1](https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/issues/1): The admin web UI for `sidekiq-unique-jobs` is not protected by any authorization constraint in the default configuration. Auth constraints must be configured by the programmer. It is recommended and expected that users will configure authorization constrains on the "admin" UI. This is not specifically related to the vulnerability but may make users who fail to constrain their "admin" UI even more vulnerable.

Note [#2](https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/issues/2): Most users of the library will not have configured the UI on a sandboxed subdomain, making all their cookies, localStorage data and session secrets [vulnerable to exposure](https://liveoverflow.com/do-not-use-alert-1-in-xss/). The purpose of a sandboxed subdomain is expressly to prevent leaking sensitive data through XSS attacks.

XSS Fix PR: [#829](https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/pull/829)

### PoC

**XSS**

Use a string like:

```
%22%3E%3Cimg/src/onerror=alert(document.domain)%3E

```

as the value for one of the parameters that are handled without escaping.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
