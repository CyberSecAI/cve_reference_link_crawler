  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application failed to sanitize user-controlled input in the URL parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the HTML output.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could potentially lead to the theft of cookies, session data, and localStorage data, potentially compromising user accounts and sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious payloads within the `filter` and `count` parameters of the following GET request endpoints:\n\n- `/sidekiq/locks`\n- `/sidekiq/changelogs`\n- `/sidekiq/expiring_locks`\n\nThe attacker could then trick a legitimate user into clicking a malicious link containing the crafted payload. Successful exploitation would require the victim to have access to the vulnerable sidekiq-unique-jobs admin interface.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and get a user with access to the vulnerable admin UI to click the URL. The attacker does not need to be authenticated in the application."
