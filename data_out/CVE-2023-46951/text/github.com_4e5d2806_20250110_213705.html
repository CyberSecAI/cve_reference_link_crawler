| For anyone stumbling across this, recent versions of sidekiq already protect against this (at least the trivial cases I could quickly come up with myself). The CSP is more restrictive since version [7.2.0](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/Changes.md#720), [sidekiq/sidekiq#6074](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/pull/6074), released October 31, 2023.  [@mhenrixon](https://github.com/mhenrixon) would you mind creating/publishing a CVE so that the ecosystem can be properly be notified of this issue? You should be able to do that directly through GitHub with their security advisories. This issue from sidekiq itself should serve as a pretty good base I think [GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35 "GHSA-h3r8-h5qw-4r35"), basically the same thing. |

| I'm fortunate enough to never have had to deal with this from this side myself yet. I did a quick search beforehand, and apparently you are able to directly request one from GitHub itself. There are other entities that can assign a CVE but to be honest that all seems a bit complicated to me.  I'm mostly basing this off of what I read at <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory>. This is also relevant <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory#requesting-a-cve-identification-number-optional>  For you, this should be <https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/security/advisories/new>. Fill that out, using the sidekiq advisory as a template, request a CVE *somewhere* on that advisory after submitting, and GitHub should take care of the rest. When all that is done (or somewhere inbetween, I don't think it matters much since the fix is already public) you can publish the advisory.  Sorry that I can't be of more use here, I'm usually just consuming these. |

| If I'm understanding this correctly...  We have already upgraded past the fix for sidekiq, as we are currently on sidekiq v7.1.6, and IIRC it was fixed in sidekiq v7.0.8. But we are on an old version of sidekiq-unique-jobs (upgrading now), and thus still had the vulnerability listed in this issue, I presume.  Does that make any sense? Is a fix for this gem not needed if we have already upgraded sidekiq? If not, then this gem needs its own separate CVE. |

| If you are on `sidekiq` below version 7.2.0 and don't have a version of `sidekiq-unique-jobs` with this fix then you are vulnerable.  The change in 7.0.8 was for a similar XSS vulnerability like here, a fix in `sidekiq` doesn't fix it in `sidekiq-unique-jobs`. The change in `sidekiq` 7.2.0 was a preventive measure for similar problems, not in response to an actual issue and wasn't backported.  I agree that a CVE here would be necessary. It's not a problem if you are on latest `sidekiq` but like someone already mentioned they are on sidekiq 6.X which wasn't vulnerable to the original issue in sidekiq (and as such doesn't have the defensive fix) but does have the problem this PR fixed (as such the desire for a backport of this).  Even though everyone should have the admin dashboard behind a constraint, knowledge that the dashboard exists and getting a user to click a malicious link is good enough for exploitation. |

| I tried. Looks like [@mhenrixon](https://github.com/mhenrixon) is the hero we need, unless another collaborator / maintainer has access.  👉 🚨 <https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/security/advisories/new> 🚨 👈  Even though everyone should have the admin dashboard behind a constraint, knowledge that the dashboard exists and getting a user to click a malicious link is good enough for exploitation.  This is an important note. Social hacking, where an attacker gets an authorized user to click on a malicious link, is often the easiest kind. |

| Massive thank you to both [@Earlopain](https://github.com/Earlopain) and [@pboling](https://github.com/pboling).  The CWE is now not only published but also fixed.  Couldn't have done it without you guys! The repository will be more secure moving forward.  [GHSA-cmh9-rx85-xj38](https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs/security/advisories/GHSA-cmh9-rx85-xj38 "GHSA-cmh9-rx85-xj38") |
