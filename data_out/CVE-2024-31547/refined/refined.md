- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the 'id' parameter in `/php-lms/admin/item/view_item.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server and exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious SQL injection queries via the `id` parameter in the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/php-lms/admin/item/view_item.php` with a crafted `id` parameter.
