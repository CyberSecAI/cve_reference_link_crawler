Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-7801:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Description:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').
*   **CWE:** CWE-89
*   **Affected Software:** Microchip TP4100
*   **Affected Version:** 2.3.12
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.5 (Medium Severity)

**Root Cause:**

The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `channelId` parameter of the `/get_chart_data` endpoint when constructing an SQL query (SQLite). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct concatenation of user-provided input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize the `channelId` parameter before using it in the database query.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the device's database, including the database structure and potentially user data.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The gained access can serve as a foundation for other, more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:**  The attack vector is over the network.
*   **HTTP Request:**  A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/get_chart_data` endpoint is used.
*  **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `channelId` parameter within the request body is the entry point for the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** An understanding of basic SQL syntax is required to construct malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code directly concatenates the `channelId` parameter into a SQL query.
*   The content provides the vulnerable URL (`https://<device_IP>/get_chart_data`), and the vulnerable parameter `channelId`.
*   The content provides examples of a payload to extract sqlite version and the structure of the DB
