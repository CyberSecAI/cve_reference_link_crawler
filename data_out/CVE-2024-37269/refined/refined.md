- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that are typically reserved for users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting a function lacking proper access control measures (missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check), allowing unprivileged users to trigger privileged actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
