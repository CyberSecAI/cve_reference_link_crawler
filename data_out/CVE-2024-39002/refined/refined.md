Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Type:** Prototype Pollution

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way the functions `empty`, `util.clone`, `util.prop`, `util.deep`, and `make` handle input arguments. They do not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject a `__proto__` property, which can modify the base `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The vulnerable functions do not properly validate input properties, allowing the `__proto__` property to be passed in.
*   **Prototype Modification:** The injected `__proto__` property is used to directly modify the prototype of all objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying the prototype, an attacker can cause unexpected behavior in the application, leading to crashes or hangs.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Depending on the gadgets and properties available within the application's environment, prototype pollution can lead to RCE.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** In certain scenarios, modifying the prototype can affect how data is rendered in the browser, potentially leading to XSS attacks.
*   **Application Logic Alteration:** The core functionality of the application may be modified by polluting properties of the base object.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker must be able to call the vulnerable functions directly or indirectly, passing specially crafted arguments.
* The payload to be injected is an object with the `__proto__` property.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to call or trigger the execution of the vulnerable functions: `empty`, `util.clone`, `util.prop`, `util.deep`, and `make`.
*   The attacker can pass a crafted JSON object containing `__proto__` to modify the properties of the Object prototype.

**Affected Component(s):** `empty`, `util.clone`, `util.prop`, `util.deep`, `make`

**Affected Package:**
*   Product: `@jsonic/jsonic-next`
*   Version: `2.12.1`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory highlights that the vulnerable functions are internal and undocumented.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The vendor has requested a reproduction using the actual API (`Jsonic(...)`). This indicates that while the vulnerability is present in the described utility functions, the vendor might not consider it a vulnerability if those functions are not intended to be directly exposed to the end user.
