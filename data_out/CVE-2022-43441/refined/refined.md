{
  "CVE-2022-43441": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way the `node-sqlite3` module handles SQL query parameters. When parameters are bound to a statement, the module iterates through them, retrieving each using `(array).Get(i)`. Subsequently, `BindParameter()` is invoked, which calls the `toString()` method of an object, which will then call `napi_coerce_to_string()`. If a crafted object is provided, defining a malicious function for the `toString()` method will result in arbitrary javascript code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes (CWE-915)",
       "Insecure handling of object coercion via toString()"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service (DoS). When exploited through Ghost CMS, the vulnerability results in a DoS, crashing the Node.js service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. The attacker provides a specially crafted Javascript object as an SQL query parameter through the `node-sqlite3` module.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests containing a malicious Javascript object to the vulnerable application. No privileges or user interaction are required."
