In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_skbmod: Skip non-Ethernet packets

Currently tcf_skbmod_act() assumes that packets use Ethernet as their L2
protocol, which is not always the case.  As an example, for CAN devices:

	$ ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
	$ ip link set up vcan0
	$ tc qdisc add dev vcan0 root handle 1: htb
	$ tc filter add dev vcan0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 10 \
		matchall action skbmod swap mac

Doing the above silently corrupts all the packets.  Do not perform skbmod
actions for non-Ethernet packets.
