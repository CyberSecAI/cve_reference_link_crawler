  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `tcf_skbmod_act()` function in the Linux kernel's networking subsystem incorrectly assumes that all packets use Ethernet as their L2 protocol.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect assumption about L2 protocol",
      "Lack of validation of packet type before performing actions"
    ],
    "impact": "Packets on non-Ethernet devices are silently corrupted when the `skbmod` action is used, which can lead to unpredictable network behavior or application crashes.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Configuration of traffic control filters on non-Ethernet devices with `skbmod` actions."
       ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to configure traffic control filters on a non-Ethernet interface (e.g. a CAN device). This usually requires root or administrator access."
