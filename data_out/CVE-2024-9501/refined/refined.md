Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9501

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user returned by the social login token. This means the plugin doesn't properly validate if the user from the social login is actually associated with the WordPress account they are attempting to log into.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass. An attacker can exploit this to log in as any existing user on the WordPress site.
*   **Insecure Social Login Handling:** The plugin fails to securely handle the social login process, lacking proper validation of the identity provided by the social login provider.
*   **Lack of verification:** The plugin uses the email from the social provider to find a matching user. If a user does not have an existing social account, an attacker can create a social login account with a valid email and log in as that user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Account Takeover:**  An attacker can gain unauthorized access to any account on the WordPress site, including administrator accounts.
*   **Data Breach:**  With access to user accounts, attackers could potentially view sensitive information.
*   **Site Defacement/Malicious Actions:** Attackers can modify the site, inject malicious code, or perform other harmful actions once authenticated.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:** Impact is high as all three security principles can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Login:** The attack vector is through the social login functionality of the plugin.
*   **Email Spoofing (Social Provider Side):** The attacker does not need to spoof the email itself, but rather create an account on a social provider with the same email as a user on the target WordPress site.
*  **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Access to a social provider:** The attacker needs access to create a social media account, and the ability to create a social media account with the same email address as the target WordPress user.
*   **Basic knowledge of social login:** The attacker needs basic understanding of social login flows.
*   **Knowledge of User Email:** The attacker would need the email address of the target user on the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in all versions of the "Wp Social Login and Register Social Counter" plugin up to and including 3.0.7
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.8.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Wesley (wcraft).
