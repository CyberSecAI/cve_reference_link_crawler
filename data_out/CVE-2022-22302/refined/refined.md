- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Clear text storage of sensitive information. The Fortinet private keys used for secure communication with Apple Push Notification and Google Cloud Messaging services are stored in clear text on the filesystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthorized local attacker can retrieve the private keys, potentially leading to unauthorized access to services relying on those keys or man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the filesystem where the private keys are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the affected FortiGate or FortiAuthenticator device.
