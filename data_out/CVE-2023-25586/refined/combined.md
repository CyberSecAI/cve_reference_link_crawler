However, since this function call is inside an `else if` branch, if the previous `if` branch is taken, the `ch_type` can be uninitialized and thus directly used to assign `sec->compress_status`. Therefore, when the `compress_status` field is used in a branch condition, the memory sanitizer aborts.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2167502#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-02-06 20:04:55 UTC  ``` In Binutils, at function `bfd_init_section_decompress_status`, a local variable is supposed to be initialized by function `bfd_check_compression_header`. However, since this function call is inside an `else if` branch, if the previous `if` branch is taken, the `ch_type` can be uninitialized and thus directly used to assign `sec->compress_status`. Therefore, when the `compress_status` field is used in a branch condition, the memory sanitizer aborts.  Upstream bug:  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29855>  Upstream fix:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=5830876a0cca17bef3b2d54908928e72cca53502>   ``` |  |
