```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses user-provided input to construct a command string that is then executed by the system shell, without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The application directly uses the `system` function to execute OS commands. The `sysprintf` function formats a string using user-controlled input and then passes this formatted string to the `system` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the web server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/ajax/remove_sniffer_raw_log/` endpoint, providing a malicious filename.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server of the Robustel R1510 device. The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters."
