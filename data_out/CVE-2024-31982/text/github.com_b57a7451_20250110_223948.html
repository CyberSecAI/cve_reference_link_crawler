# Remote code execution as guest via DatabaseSearch

Critical

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-2858-8cfx-69m9
Apr 10, 2024

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-search-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 2.4-milestone-1, < 14.10.20
>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.4
>= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.10-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.10.20
15.5.4
15.10-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

XWiki's database search allows remote code execution through the search text. This allows remote code execution for any visitor of a public wiki or user of a closed wiki as the database search is by default accessible for all users. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.

To reproduce on an instance, without being logged in, go to `<hostname>/xwiki/bin/get/Main/DatabaseSearch?outputSyntax=plain&text=%7D%7D%7D%7B%7Basync%20async%3Dfalse%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28%22Hello%20from%22%20%2B%20%22%20search%20text%3A%22%20%2B%20%2823%20%2B%2019%29%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D%20`. If the title of the RSS channel contains `Hello from search text:42`, the instance is vulnerable.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.20, 15.5.4 and 15.10RC1.

### Workarounds

It is possible to manually apply [this patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/95bdd6cc6298acdf7f8f21298d40eeb8390a8565#diff-ef3314b8bb489e5368618ea1940c59098b18ec2246cc65fe337ae636de87e404) to the page `Main.DatabaseSearch`. Alternatively, unless database search is explicitly used by users, this page can be deleted as this is not the default search interface of XWiki.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
