Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-25980:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the H5P attempts report not respecting the "Separate Groups" mode settings in Moodle. This means that when the "Separate groups" mode is enabled for an activity, the H5P attempts report incorrectly displays user data from other groups, which should not be accessible to users in a given group.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core weakness is that the H5P attempts report does not properly enforce the access restrictions defined by the "Separate groups" mode. This results in a privilege escalation where users might be able to see activity data of users in other groups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of user data related to H5P activity attempts to unauthorized users. Specifically, users in separate groups might be able to view the attempts data of users belonging to other groups.
*   The vulnerability is described as **minor** since by default it only provides access to non-editing teachers,

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through accessing the H5P attempts report within a Moodle course. A user who is enrolled in a course with H5P activities and has access to the attempts report, while "Separate Groups" mode is activated, can potentially view the attempts of users belonging to different groups.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user with access to the H5P activity and its corresponding attempts report. This includes non-editing teachers and potentially other users with specific permissions related to H5P activity reports within a course that has "Separate Groups" enabled.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 4.3 to 4.3.2, 4.2 to 4.2.5, and 4.1 to 4.1.8, including earlier unsupported versions, are affected.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Moodle versions 4.3.3, 4.2.6, and 4.1.9.
*   **Reported by:** Leon Stringer
*   **Moodle Tracker issue:** MDL-80501
