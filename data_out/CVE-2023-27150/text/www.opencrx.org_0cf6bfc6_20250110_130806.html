#### Ready for the cloud

openCRX runs on any [Jakarte EE 8 Web Profile 8](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/webprofile/8/) compliant application server and supports all major databases. The standard installer comes with [Apache TomEE](https://tomee.apache.org/) which allows installation with a few clicks on any operating system or cloud service supporting Java. Moreover, with the support of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) openCRX is ready for the cloud: virtually unlimited scalability, easy move between data centers and clouds, update with zero downtime and more.

#### Powerful integration capabilities

openCRX is from the ground up service-based and allows easy integration with your existing applications. openCRX features a [Java API](https://www.opencrx.org/opencrx/3.0/java/index.html) for Java-based clients and a [Swagger-compliant RESTful API](https://swagger.io/). In addition, openCRX comes with a set of adapters supporting [WebDAV](https://www.webdav.org/specs/), [CalDAV](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt) and [CardDAV](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6352) for contacts, calendars and documents.

#### Easy to extend and customize

openCRX is extremely flexible and designed to be extended and customized in all aspects and at all levels: starting from simple, XML-based GUI customizing up to modifying the standard business-logic or even extending the API. The strict separation of core and custom extensions allows hassle-free upgrades to newer versions.
