Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-25524:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the authentication flow of the NVIDIA Omniverse Workstation Launcher. During the authentication process, a user's access token is exposed in the browser's address bar.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the insecure handling of the access token, which is directly displayed in the URL. This is a violation of secure coding practices as it makes the token easily accessible. The CWE associated is CWE-598, which refers to "Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request."
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who obtains the access token can impersonate the legitimate user and access resources associated with the Omniverse Launcher. This could lead to information disclosure, although the impact is rated as "low" in terms of confidentiality loss.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is primarily local. As the token is displayed in the browser address bar, it would likely require an attacker to be able to view the user's screen, access their browser history, or potentially via malicious browser extensions or other local access mechanisms. The access token exposure occurs when a legitimate user is using the application.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to either view the user's browser or have some sort of access to the user's system and browser history to retrieve the exposed token. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability, meaning any user on the system could perform the attack if the token is exposed.

The document also provides remediation information, indicating that version 1.8.11 of the Omniverse Workstation Launcher addresses the issue, and that affected versions are 1.8.7 and earlier.
