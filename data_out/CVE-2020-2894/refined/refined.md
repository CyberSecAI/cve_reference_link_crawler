Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-2894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of IP checksums within the virtualized e1000 network interface of Oracle VirtualBox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The issue stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data related to IP checksums, leading to a read operation beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the affected VirtualBox installation.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to potentially execute code within the hypervisor's context, although this is not direct impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to execute high-privileged code within the guest system to trigger this vulnerability. This means that the attacker has already compromised the guest operating system to some extent.
- **Virtualized e1000 Network Interface:** The attack targets the virtualized e1000 network interface within VirtualBox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High-Privileged Code Execution on Guest:** The attacker must first achieve the ability to execute code with elevated privileges inside the virtual machine to exploit this specific flaw.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by anhdaden of STAR Labs, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Oracle has released an update to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "moderate" severity by openSUSE, but has a CVSS score of 5.5 by ZDI and Oracle.
- The vulnerability can be exploited locally but has implications for the hypervisor.
