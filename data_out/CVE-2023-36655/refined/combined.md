# CVE-2023-36655

##### Description

The login REST API in ProLion CryptoSpike 3.0.15P2 (when LDAP or Active Directory is used as the users store) allows a remote blocked user to login and obtain an authentication token by specifying a username with different uppercase/lowercase character combination.

##### Details

### Introduction

CryptoSpike can leverage Active Directory (AD) for authentication and authorization purposes for its users/operators both for web management interface login and for REST API endpoints invocation. Login of AD users can be blocked or unblocked by administrators using a dedicated section via the web management interface. The REST API endpoint performing login of users is vulnerable to authentication bypass by alternative name, when the username of a blocked user is specified as input with a combination of different uppercase/lowercase characters, e.g., if the user `user.name@domain.local` is blocked, using `uSer.name@domain.local` will result in a successfully login).

### Steps to reproduce

A user named `user.name@domain.local` exists on Active Directory and is allowed to authenticate on CryptoSpike through the web management interface or by invoking the REST API login endpoint in order to obtain a JWT Bearer Token and then invoke other REST API endpoints. For the sake of simplicity, we focus on the web application scenario, but the same applies to login REST API endpoint (`https://leaderhostname/api/v1/Server/auth/login`).

As soon as the `user.name@domain.local` user successfully login on CryptoSpike, a new user is automatically created inside the system. This can be confirmed under the User Management", "Users" section of the web management.

Let a privileged system user deactivates the user identified by user.name@domain.local through the web management interface in the "User Management", "Users" section using the button in the "Actions" column (the action is confirmed with a red icon in the user row).

If the user then tries to login on the web management interface with `user.name@domain.local` as username and the correct password, the login will be denied. If this user uses `uSer.name@domain.local` instead, the login will succeed. The same can be accomplished by using variants such as `usEr.name@domain.local`, `uSEr.name@domain.local`, and so on.

Moreover, since a new item is created by CryptoSpike when an Active Directory user succeed to login on the system, every time the same user with a different combination of uppercase/lowercase characters in username performs login successfully, a new user is created in CryptoSpike, thus potentially affecting accountability on the system.
