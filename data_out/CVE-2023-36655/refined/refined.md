Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the login REST API in ProLion CryptoSpike 3.0.15P2 not properly handling case sensitivity when checking the status of blocked users. Specifically, when LDAP or Active Directory is used as the user store, a blocked user can bypass the block by logging in with the same username but with a different combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability for a blocked user to bypass the block by using a case-insensitive variation of their username.
*   **Case-Insensitive Username Handling:** The login API does not normalize or canonicalize usernames, leading to the bypass.
*   **Accountability Issues:** Each successful login with a new case variation of the username creates a new user entry within CryptoSpike. This can affect accountability and potentially cause resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A blocked user can regain access to the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Though not explicitly mentioned, unauthorized access can lead to further actions depending on the user's privileges.
*   **Audit/Accountability Issues**: The creation of multiple user entries with different letter cases for the same user can impact the ability to trace user actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited via the login REST API endpoint.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker does not require local access. They need network access to the CryptoSpike application.
*   **Authentication endpoint**: The specific endpoint affected is `/api/v1/Server/auth/login`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the username and password for a user who has been blocked.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CryptoSpike instance.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand the case-sensitivity issue and use the same username with a different casing combination

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present when LDAP or Active Directory is used as the user store.
*   The issue applies to both the web management interface login and REST API login.
*   The vulnerability affects the authentication process and not just the authorization once logged in.
