{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-44360",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `SetNorm`'s JSON `param` parser does not validate the input type and assumes that the `param` JSON element is always an object. When it's not an object, the program will assert and the `cgiserver.cgi` process will be terminated, causing the device to reboot.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Lack of type checking on JSON input"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service - The device will reboot due to a failed assertion in the `cgiserver.cgi` process.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON payload where the 'param' value is not a JSON object to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. While most of these vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, itâ€™s possible to use TALOS-2021-1420 to perform these API calls without authentication."
