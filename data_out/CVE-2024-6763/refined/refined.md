Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-6763:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `HttpURI` class in Eclipse Jetty performs insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI. This leads to inconsistent parsing of the host component compared to common browsers.
*   The vulnerability stems from the difference in how `HttpURI` and browsers (like Chrome) handle invalid URIs, specifically those containing user info (e.g., `username:password@hostname:port`). `HttpURI` doesn't fail on these invalid URIs, but it may extract a different hostname compared to the browser. This difference can lead to security issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inconsistent Host Parsing:** `HttpURI` can extract a different host from a malformed URI compared to browsers.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** `HttpURI` lacks proper validation of the authority part of the URI, particularly concerning user information, special characters, and the distinction between valid and invalid URIs.
*   The use of RFC3986 for URI parsing in `HttpURI` and a different spec (WhatWG) used in browsers contributes to the discrepancy.
*   The issue is not in the Jetty server or client directly, but in the `HttpURI` utility class itself when used by applications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** An attacker could potentially bypass host blocklists or other security measures implemented using `HttpURI` by crafting a malicious URI.
*   **URL Redirection:** Attackers can cause a user to be redirected to an unintended host, by exploiting the different parsing between the Jetty's `HttpURI` class and browser's URI parsing implementation.
*   **Bypass of Security Measures:** The vulnerability allows bypassing security mechanisms that rely on validating hostnames extracted by `HttpURI`, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URI Input:** The primary attack vector is through a malformed URI supplied by an attacker. Examples include:
    *   `http://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/`
    *   `http://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/`
    *   `http://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/`
    *   `http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/`
    *   `http://vulndetector.com\\/`
*   **302 Redirect Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be exploited through redirects where the browser interprets the malformed URL differently from Jetty.
*   **HTML Links:** Attackers can use malformed URIs in HTML links (`<a href="...">`) to trigger redirects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed URI that is processed by an application using `HttpURI`.
*   The attacker doesn't require any specific user privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `HttpURI` class when used as a utility within an application, and not directly within the Jetty server or client usage of the class.
*   The fix involves adding more strict validation to the URI authority, and eventually deprecating user info in URI per RFC9110.
*   The issue highlights the discrepancy between RFC3986 compliant parsers and WhatWG URL parsing implementations used in browsers.
*   The CVE affects Jetty versions from 7.0.0 to 12.0.11.
*   The vulnerability has a low severity score of 3.7.
*   This CVE is due to the differences in URI parsing between Jetty (RFC3986) and browsers (WhatWG).
*   The maintainers consider this a low severity issue as it requires an application to use HttpURI directly, and not the standard server/client functionality.
*   Jetty 9/10/11 are going EOL on Jan 1, 2025 and will not be backported with a fix unless commercial support contracts dictate so.
*   The current fix deprecates the use of user info in URLs in Jetty 12, in line with RFC 9110.
