Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45806:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper escaping of display names before they are used in a regular expression. Specifically, when a user's display name contains the pipe symbol `|`, it can cause excessive content duplication in quoted posts when the user updates their display name. The vulnerability occurs because the display name is used to construct a regex that is used to update quotes. If the display name isn't escaped, regex special characters such as `|` can have unintended consequences.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Regexp Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a regexp injection. User-controlled input (the display name) is used directly within a regular expression without proper escaping. The pipe character '|' is interpreted as a regex OR operator, leading to unintended regex behavior and denial of service.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** There is an absence of proper sanitization or validation of the display name input, specifically regarding regex special characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By including a `|` character in a user's display name, an attacker can trigger a bug that causes an excessive number of updates and content duplication within the posts where that user is quoted, ultimately leading to a denial of service by overwhelming the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **User Profile Modification:** The attack vector involves modifying a user's display name to include the `|` character.
- **Quote Functionality:** The vulnerability is exploited through the quote functionality in Discourse, where user display names are referenced.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs a low-privilege account on the Discourse platform to modify their display name.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack requires no interaction from other users besides the attacker changing their display name.
- **Network Access:**  The attack is performed over the network by interacting with the application.

**Additional Details**
- The provided commit diffs show the fix involves escaping the display name using `Regexp.escape` before using it in the regular expression, which prevents the `|` character from being interpreted as a regex operator and mitigates the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 4.3.

In summary, CVE-2023-45806 is a moderate-severity vulnerability where a malformed display name can cause excessive processing, leading to a denial of service. This is due to a lack of input escaping when constructing regular expressions.
