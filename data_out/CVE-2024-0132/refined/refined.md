- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Time-of-check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability exists in NVIDIA Container Toolkit when used with default configurations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: TOCTOU vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation, information disclosure, and data tampering.
- **Attack vectors**: A specifically crafted container image can gain access to the host file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious container image and have user-level privileges to run the container. User interaction is required. The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted container image is run.
