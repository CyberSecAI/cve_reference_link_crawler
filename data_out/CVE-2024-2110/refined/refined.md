Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation for several actions within the Events Manager plugin. This allows unauthorized modification of booking statuses via crafted requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The plugin lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks, making it vulnerable to malicious requests initiated from a different website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can modify booking statuses (approve, reject, delete, unapprove) without proper authorization. This could lead to disruptions in event management, unauthorized access to event bookings, and potential manipulation of event data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. An attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a logged-in administrator into executing it. This is typically achieved by enticing the administrator to click a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or form that targets the vulnerable plugin.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into interacting with this malicious URL/form.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site, but they must be able to target an authenticated administrator.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Events Manager plugin up to and including 6.4.7.1.
- The fix was implemented in version 6.4.7.2, by adding nonce checks to booking actions.
- The specific actions affected include approving, rejecting, deleting, and unapproving bookings.
