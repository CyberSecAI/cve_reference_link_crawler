Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Nimbus skin for MediaWiki improperly handles user-provided input within the `MediaWiki:Nimbus-sidebar` message, specifically when constructing the navigation menu.
*   The skin directly includes the text and potentially the link from the sidebar configuration in the HTML output without proper sanitization, allowing for injection of arbitrary HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, because the malicious payload is saved within the MediaWiki message and is executed whenever a user views a page using the Nimbus skin.
*   **Improper Output Sanitization:** The `NimbusTemplate.php` file did not sanitize user-provided text and URLs before rendering them as part of the navigation menu.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
*   **Account Compromise:** Attackers could potentially steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, including modifying content, or redirecting to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **MediaWiki Message Injection:** An attacker with sufficient privileges to edit `MediaWiki:Nimbus-sidebar` can insert malicious JavaScript code within the message text and/or URL.
*   **Navigation Menu Display:** When a user views a page using the Nimbus skin, the vulnerable code generates the navigation menu, rendering the injected HTML and executing the JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Edit MediaWiki Messages:** The attacker needs to have the privilege to edit MediaWiki messages, specifically `MediaWiki:Nimbus-sidebar`, which typically requires administrative rights or similar level of permission.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is specifically in how `NimbusTemplate.php` handles the text and links defined in `MediaWiki:Nimbus-sidebar`.
* The vulnerability occurs in the `printMenu` function where it constructs the HTML menu without proper escaping.
* The fix involves applying `htmlspecialchars` to both the text and the href attributes when building the HTML for navigation menu items.
* The vulnerability exists in multiple branches of the Nimbus skin, including REL1_40, REL1_41, REL1_42, and master.
* The vulnerability is also related to similar XSS vulnerabilities discovered in other MediaWiki skins such as GuMaxDD, Metrolook, Foreground, and Tempo skins which are reported on other phabricator tickets ([T361448](/T361448), [T361449](/T361449), [T361452](/T361452), [T361451](/T361451)).
