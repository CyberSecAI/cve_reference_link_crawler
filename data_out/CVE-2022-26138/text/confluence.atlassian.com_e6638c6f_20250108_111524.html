| CVE ID(s) | [CVE-2022-26138](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-26138) |

# **Summary of Vulnerability**

When the [Questions for Confluence app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211644/questions-for-confluence?hosting=server&tab=overview) is enabled on Confluence Server or Data Center, it creates a Confluence user account with the username `disabledsystemuser`. This account is intended to aid administrators that are migrating data from the app to Confluence Cloud. The `disabledsystemuser` account is created with a hardcoded password and is added to the `confluence-users` group, which allows viewing and editing all non-restricted pages within Confluence [by default](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-groups-139478.html). A remote, unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded password could exploit this to log into Confluence and access any pages the `confluence-users` group has access to.

The `disabledsystemuser` account is configured with a third party email address (`dontdeletethisuser@email.com`) that is not controlled by Atlassian. If this vulnerability has not been remediated per the *Fixes* section below, an affected instance configured to send [notifications](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/email-notifications-145162.html "https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/email-notifications-145162.html") will email that address. One example of an email notification is [Recommended Updates Notifications](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-the-recommended-updates-email-notification-281480712.html "https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-the-recommended-updates-email-notification-281480712.html"), which contains a report of the top pages from Confluence spaces the user has permissions to view. mail.com, the free email provider that manages the `dontdeletethisuser@email.com` account, has confirmed to Atlassian that the account has been blocked. This means it cannot be accessed by anyone unauthorized and cannot send or receive any new messages.

An external party has discovered and publicly disclosed the hardcoded password on Twitter. Refer to the *Fixes* section below for guidance on how to remediate this vulnerability.

## Severity

This vulnerability should be remediated on affected systems immediately for the following reasons:

* The hardcoded password is publicly known
* There are reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild
* Instances where this vulnerability has not been remediated per the *Fixes* section below may be configured to send [email notifications](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/email-notifications-145162.html "https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/email-notifications-145162.html") from Confluence to a third party email address that is not controlled by Atlassian

Atlassian rates the [severity level](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels) of this vulnerability as **critical**. The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low. This is our assessment, and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

# **How To Determine If You Are Affected**

A Confluence Server or Data Center instance is affected if it has an active user account with the following information:

* User: `disabledsystemuser`
* Username: `disabledsystemuser`
* Email: `dontdeletethisuser@email.com`

![(warning)](/s/-tb799o/9012/oiycav/_/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) It is possible for this account to be present if the Questions for Confluence app has previously been installed and uninstalled.

If this account does not show up in the list of active users, the Confluence instance is not affected.

# **Affected Versions**

These are the versions of the app that create the `disabledsystemuser` account with a hardcoded password. Confluence installations that do not actively have any of these versions of the app installed **may still be affected**. Refer to the *How To Determine If You Are Affected* section above and the *Remediation* section below for more information.

| Questions for Confluence 2.7.x | * 2.7.34 * 2.7.35 |
| --- | --- |
| Questions for Confluence 3.0.x | * 3.0.2 |

# **Fixes**

Uninstalling the Questions for Confluence app does **not** remediate this vulnerability. The `disabledsystemuser` account does not automatically get removed after the app has been uninstalled. If you have verified a Confluence Server or Data Center instance is affected, two equally effective ways to remediate this vulnerability are listed below.

These options either disable or remove the `disabledsystemuser` account. Configuring data migration from the app to Confluence Cloud is now a manual process.

## Option 1: Update to a non-vulnerable version of Questions for Confluence

Update the Questions for Confluence app to a fixed version:

* 2.7.x >= 2.7.38 (compatible with Confluence 6.13.18 through 7.16.2)
* Versions >= 3.0.5 (compatible with Confluence 7.16.3 and later)

For more information on how to update an app, refer to:

<https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/updating-apps-273875710.html>

Fixed versions of the Questions for Confluence app stop creating the `disabledsystemuser` user account, and remove it from the system if it has already been created.

If Confluence is configured to use a read-only external directory (e.g. Atlassian Crowd), you will need to follow Option 2 below.

## Option 2: Disable or delete the `disabledsystemuser` account

Search for the `disabledsystemuser` account and either disable it or delete it. For instructions on how to disable or delete an account (including an explanation of the differences between the two options), refer to:

<https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/delete-or-disable-users-138318.html>

If you choose to delete the `disabledsystemuser` account, you must also [uninstall](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/uninstalling-apps-273875709.html) or upgrade the Questions for Confluence app to a non-vulnerable version. **Failure to do this could result in the account being recreated after it has been deleted.**

If Confluence is configured to use a read-only external directory, refer to the *Delete from a read-only external directory, or multiple external directories* section of the same document:

<https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/delete-or-disable-users-138318.html#DeleteorDisableUsers-Deletefromaread-onlyexternaldirectory,ormultipleexternaldirectories>

# **How To Look For Evidence of Exploitation**

To determine if anyone has successfully logged in to the `disabledsystemuser` account, refer to the following document which provides instructions on how to get a list of users' last logon times:

<https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-get-a-list-of-users-with-their-last-logon-times-985499701.html>

If the last authentication time for `disabledsystemuser` is `null`, that means the account exists but no one has ever logged into it.

# **How To Look For Evidence of Information Disclosure Via Email**

To determine if Confluence has sent any email notifications to a third party email account, review the logs of the [SMTP server configured to send outbound mail from Confluence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-a-server-for-outgoing-mail-151078.html "https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-a-server-for-outgoing-mail-151078.html") for any messages sent to the address `dontdeletethisuser@email.com`
