### Vulnerability Summary

When the [Questions for Confluence app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211644/questions-for-confluence?hosting=server&tab=overview) is enabled on Confluence Server or Data Center, it creates a Confluence user account with the username disabledsystemuser. This account is intended to aid administrators that are migrating data from the app to Confluence Cloud. The disabledsystemuser account is created with a hardcoded password and is added to the confluence-users group, which allows viewing and editing all non-restricted pages within Confluence [by default](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-groups-139478.html). A remote, unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded password could exploit this to log into Confluence.

The disabledsystemuser account is configured with a third party email address (dontdeletethisuser@email.com) that is not controlled by Atlassian. If this vulnerability has not been remediated per the *Fixes*Â section below, an affected instanceÂ configuredÂ to sendÂ [notifications](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/email-notifications-145162.html)Â will email that address.Â One exampleÂ of an email notification isÂ [Recommended Updates Notifications](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-the-recommended-updates-email-notification-281480712.html), which contains a report of the top pages from Confluence spaces the user has permissions to view. mail.com, the free email provider that manages the dontdeletethisuser@email.comÂ account, has confirmed to Atlassian that the account has been blocked. This means it cannot be accessed by anyone unauthorized and cannot send or receive any new messages.

![](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png) An external party has discovered and publicly disclosed the hardcoded password on Twitter. Refer to the *Remediation* section below for guidance on how to remediate this vulnerability.

### How To Determine If You Are Affected

A Confluence Server or Data Center instance is affected if it has an active user account with the following information:

* User: disabledsystemuser
* Username: disabledsystemuser
* Email: dontdeletethisuser@email.com

If this account does not show up in the list of active users, the Confluence instance is not affected.

### Remediation

![](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png) Uninstalling the Questions for Confluence app does **not** remediate this vulnerability. The disabledsystemuser account does not automatically get removed after the app has been uninstalled. If you have verified a Confluence Server or Data Center instance is affected, two equally effective ways to remediate this vulnerability are listed below. ![](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png)

#### Option 1: Update to a non-vulnerable version of Questions for Confluence

Update the Questions for Confluence app to a fixed version:

* 2.7.x >= 2.7.38
* Versions >= 3.0.5

For more information on how to update an app, refer to [Atlassian's documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/updating-apps-273875710.html).

Fixed versions of the Questions for Confluence app stop creating the disabledsystemuser user account, and remove it from the system if it has already been created. Migrating data from the app to Confluence Cloud is now a manual process.

![](/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png) If Confluence is configured to use a read-only external directory (e.g. Atlassian Crowd), you will need to follow Option 2 below.

#### Option 2: Disable or delete the disabledsystemuser account

Search for the disabledsystemuser account and either disable it or delete it. For instructions on how to disable or delete an account (including an explanation of the differences between the two options), refer to [Atlassian's documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/delete-or-disable-users-138318.html).

If you choose to delete the disabledsystemuser account, you must also [uninstall](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/uninstalling-apps-273875709.html) or upgrade the Questions for Confluence app to a non-vulnerable version. **Failure to do this could result in the account being recreated after it has been deleted.**

If Confluence is configured to use a read-only external directory, refer to the [Delete from a read-only external directory, or multiple external directories section](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/delete-or-disable-users-138318.html#DeleteorDisableUsers-Deletefromaread-onlyexternaldirectory,ormultipleexternaldirectories)Â from the same document
