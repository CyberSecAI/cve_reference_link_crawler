# [Apache Fineract Security Report](/confluence/display/FINERACT/Apache%2BFineract%2BSecurity%2BReport)

* Created by  [Nazeer Shaik](/confluence/display/~nazeer1100126), last modified by  [James Dailey](/confluence/display/~jdailey) on [Oct 17, 2024](/confluence/pages/diffpagesbyversion.action?pageId=74690460&selectedPageVersions=31&selectedPageVersions=32 "Show changes")

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in a released version of Apache Fineract. Each vulnerability is reported via the <http://www.apache.org/security/> process and given a security impact rating by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may vary from platform to platform.  If you have identified a security issue, email security AT fineract.apache.org.

Amendment of November 29, 2022:  In order to ensure that users are given warning of critical issues, the Apache Fineract project may use its relationship with the independent Mifos Initiative to ensure that users of the Fineract backend and Mifos front end UI are informed of such vulnerabilities and are able to assist in testing and validating patches.

The Apache Fineract project recommends that you secure the platform by not running it directly on the internet.  IP filtering and other techniques may be essential for all API ingress.  In particular, simply running the solution in default mode, connecting it with a front end UI, is not considered best practice for a production environment of fineract unless additional security layers and practices are added.   Please note on [Securing Fineract](/confluence/display/FINERACT/Securing%2BFineract) that our advice is giving freely but is not meant as a replacement for your own due diligence.

**CVE-2022-44635: file upload vulnerability**

[DESCRIPTION]:  Apache Fineract allowed an authenticated user to perform remote code execution due to a path traversal vulnerability in a file upload component of Apache Fineract, allowing an attacker to run remote code.  This issue affects Apache Fineract version 1.8.0 and prior versions.
