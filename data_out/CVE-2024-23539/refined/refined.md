Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. Specifically, the `sqlSearch` parameter in certain API endpoints of Apache Fineract was vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `sqlSearch` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate database queries. The exact level of manipulation depends on the database permissions.
- **Data Exfiltration/Modification:** Through SQL injection, attackers can read or modify database records they would normally not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable API endpoints that accept the `sqlSearch` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send requests to the Fineract server.
- **API knowledge:** Attackers need to identify the vulnerable API endpoints and their parameters, in this case the `sqlSearch` parameter

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Apache Fineract versions 1.8.4 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.9.0.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2024-23538 but on different endpoints.
