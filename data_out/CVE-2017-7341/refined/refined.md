- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FortiWLC file management AP script download webUI page is vulnerable to OS Command Injection due to insufficient sanitization of input parameters. Specifically, a path traversal vulnerability allows for manipulation of the download path, which can be leveraged to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - OS Command Injection: Malicious input allows execution of system commands.
    - Path Traversal: Vulnerability in how file paths are handled allows access to unintended files and directories.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated admin user can execute arbitrary system console commands, potentially gaining root access to the device and full control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through the webUI page related to AP script downloads and can be exploited by manipulating the download path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user of the FortiWLC system to exploit this vulnerability.
