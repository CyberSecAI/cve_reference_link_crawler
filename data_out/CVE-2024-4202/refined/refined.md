Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure instantiation vulnerability
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper control of generation of code (CWE-94), also known as code injection.
    *   The Telerik Reporting engine loads custom assemblies without proper validation, leading to potential code execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Local code execution on the machine running the Telerik Reporting engine. This occurs when desktop report viewers (WinForms, WPF, WinUI) connect to a remote reporting engine and load custom assemblies.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Replacing one or more Telerik Reporting assemblies with custom, malicious assemblies.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to provide and have the Telerik Reporting engine load a malicious assembly, likely on the server-side of the reporting system.
    *   The attacker needs to have access/ability to modify or replace the Telerik assemblies.
    *   This attack scenario is relevant in scenarios where custom assemblies are being used with Telerik Reporting.
*   **Affected Versions:** Telerik Reporting versions prior to 2024 Q2 (18.1.24.514), specifically 18.0.24.305 and earlier.
*   **Solution:** Upgrade to Telerik Reporting 2024 Q2 (18.1.24.514) or later.
*   **CVSS:** 7.7 (High)
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4202
