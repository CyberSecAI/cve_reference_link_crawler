# Jupyter server on Windows discloses Windows user password hash

High

[blink1073](/blink1073)
published
GHSA-hrw6-wg82-cm62
Jun 6, 2024

## Package

pip

jupyter\_server
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=2.14.0

## Patched versions

2.14.1

## Description

### Summary

Jupyter Server on Windows has a vulnerability that lets unauthenticated attackers leak the NTLMv2 password hash of the Windows user running the Jupyter server. An attacker can crack this password to gain access to the Windows machine hosting the Jupyter server, or access other network-accessible machines or 3rd party services using that credential. Or an attacker perform an NTLM relay attack without cracking the credential to gain access to other network-accessible machines.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

* filefind: avoid handling absolute paths

we don't need or want absolute path support,
which we inherited from generic ipython_genutils

only supporting relative paths lets us avoid attempting to accessing files we know we won't accept

* Apply suggestions from code review

Co-authored-by: M Bussonnier <bussonniermatthias@gmail.com>

* filefind: only accept Sequence[str]

we only call it one place, might as well be simple about it

* version_info gate for is_relative_to

* clarify docstring
