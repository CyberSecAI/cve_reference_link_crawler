Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `/view_result.php` URI of the "Simple Realtime Quiz System" version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`qid` parameter in the URL) before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (access to sensitive information)
    - Data manipulation (modification or deletion of data)
    - Privilege escalation (potentially gain administrative access)
    - System compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `/view_result.php` with a malicious `qid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
-  No specific authentication is mentioned, so it is implied that the attacker doesn't need any special privileges to be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses sqlmap to demonstrate the vulnerability, showing that the `qid` parameter is injectable.
- The PoC provides a sample HTTP request with a malicious `qid` value.
-  The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation.
