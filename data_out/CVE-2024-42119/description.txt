In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Skip finding free audio for unknown engine_id

[WHY]
ENGINE_ID_UNKNOWN = -1 and can not be used as an array index. Plus, it
also means it is uninitialized and does not need free audio.

[HOW]
Skip and return NULL.

This fixes 2 OVERRUN issues reported by Coverity.
