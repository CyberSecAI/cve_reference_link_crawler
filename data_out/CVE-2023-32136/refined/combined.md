## D-Link DAP-1360 webproc var:menu Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-528ZDI-CAN-18414

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-32136](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32136) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.8, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [D-Link](https://www.dlink.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | DAP-1360 |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-1360 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling requests to the /cgi-bin/webproc endpoint. When parsing the var:menu parameter, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. |

(non-US) DAP-1360 Rev. F1 & (non-US) DAP-2020 Rev. A2 :: Multiple vulnerabilities by ZDI at TrendMicro

**Overview**

On September 8, 2022, 3rd party security research from TrendMicro ZDI reported the (non-US) D-Link DIR-1360 hardware revision Fx with firmware versions v6.14B01 as having multiple vulnerabilities.

As soon as D-Link was made aware of the reported security issues, we had promptly started our investigation and began developing security patches. During the investigation the (non-US) D-Link DAP-2020 hardware revision Fx was also affected by these same vulnerabilities.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures.
