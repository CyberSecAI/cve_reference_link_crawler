Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-50578 (based on the issue title "Mingsoft MCMS v5.2.9 前台查询文章列表接口存在SQL注入" which is likely a reference to CVE-2023-50578)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `sqlWhere` parameter of the `/cms/content/list.do` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically within the `sqlWhere` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input in the `sqlWhere` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database. This could allow them to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, personal information, other application data)
    - Modify data in the database (e.g., change records, add new records, delete records)
    - Execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows for information disclosure via the `updatexml()` function in the SQL payload as demonstrated in the provided POC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/cms/content/list.do` endpoint.
- **`sqlWhere` Parameter:** The malicious SQL injection payload is embedded in the `sqlWhere` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability is present in the front-end query interface which doesn't appear to require prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/cms/content/list.do`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `sqlWhere`
- **Exploitation Method:** SQL Injection
- **Payload Example:**
```
categoryType=1&sqlWhere=[{"action":"and","field":"updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(SELECT  current_user),0x7e),1)","el":"eq","model":"contentTitle","name":"文章标题","type":"input","value":"111"}]&pageNo=1&pageSize=10
```
- **Specific payload:** The provided payload utilizes the `updatexml()` function in MySQL to trigger an error containing the result of the subquery `SELECT current_user`. This allows the attacker to confirm the injection vulnerability and retrieve the current database user.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content includes a POC that shows how to extract the database user information.
- The vulnerability exists in Mingsoft MCMS v5.2.9
- The issue was reported on Gitee and is marked as "Done".
- The maintainers of the project have acknowledged the issue and advised updating to the newest version.
