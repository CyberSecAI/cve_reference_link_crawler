| Summary OneNav v0.9.35-20240318 has SSRF vulnerability. After gaining the administrator permission, an attacker can obtain Intranet website information through the get\_link\_info interface. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to construct requests with dangerous features and cause the server side to initiate these dangerous network requests. Details Incoming links are not strictly checked for security, which may result in access to internal server resources. In addition, the administrator can obtain Intranet website information through the get\_link\_info interface. Such behavior may leak the internal information of the server.
