Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5632:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Longse NVR (Network Video Recorder) model NVR3608PGE2W creating a WiFi network secured with a default, pre-defined password. Users are not prompted or instructed to change this password during the setup process, nor is it mentioned in the user manual.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use of Default Credentials (CWE-1392):** The NVR uses a default WiFi password, which is the same across all devices of the same model. This makes the network easily accessible to anyone knowing the default password.
*   **Lack of User Guidance:** The device does not advise users to change the default WiFi password, either during setup or in the user manual. This results in most users leaving the default password unchanged.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Network Access:** An attacker who knows the default password can gain access to the created WiFi network.
*   **Potential access to camera feeds:** Because the cameras in the set connect to the NVR's WiFi automatically, a network attacker could potentially gain access to the camera feeds.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Wireless Network Proximity:** An attacker needs to be within the range of the NVR's WiFi network.
*   **Knowledge of Default Password:** The attacker must know the pre-defined default WiFi password for the NVR model NVR3608PGE2W.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Proximity to the device:** The attacker needs to be physically within the range of the NVR's WiFi signal to connect to the network.
*   **Knowledge of the default password:** The attacker needs to know the default WiFi password for the vulnerable NVR model.

**Additional details:**

*   The CERT Polska report indicates that this vulnerability affects all versions of the Longse NVR model NVR3608PGE2W, and products based on this device such as Zamel ZMB-01/ZMB-01C.
*   The devices are end-of-life, and the vendor will not be issuing patches.
