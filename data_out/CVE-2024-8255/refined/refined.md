Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8255

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The application is vulnerable because it deserializes data from an untrusted source without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-502:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the deserialization of untrusted data. The document states that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, but a user interaction is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have some level of access to the system to provide the malicious payload that will be deserialized. The user interaction involves a non privileged user triggering the vulnerability.
*   Low attack complexity is indicated.

**Affected Products:**

*   Delta Electronics DTN Soft, version 2.0.1 and prior.

**Mitigation:**
*   Update DTN Soft to version 2.1 or later.
*   Minimize network exposure of control systems.
*   Isolate control system networks behind firewalls.
*   Use VPNs for remote access, keeping them updated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to CISA by kimiya working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   The advisory mentions that no known public exploitation has been reported at this time.
*   The software is used in Critical Manufacturing and Energy sectors.
