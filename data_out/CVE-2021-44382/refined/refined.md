The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44382.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cgiserver.cgi` process in Reolink RLC-410W IP cameras improperly handles JSON command parsing. Specifically, the `SetIrLights` API's JSON parameter parser assumes the "param" value is a JSON object, but does not validate this assumption, leading to a crash if it is not an object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application does not validate the type of the "param" JSON element, leading to an assert failure if it's not an object. This occurs when accessing the JSON element using the subscription operator (`[]`) in the API-specific parameter parser.
- **Denial of Service:** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a non-object "param" value, an attacker can cause the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash, leading to a device reboot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, where the camera reboots, interrupting its functionality.
- **Availability loss:** This effectively renders the camera unavailable until it reboots, potentially impacting its surveillance capabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- **JSON Payload:** The request body must contain a JSON payload where the `param` element for the `SetIrLights` command is not a JSON object (e.g., a string like `""`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera's IP address.
- **Unauthenticated Access (Potentially):** While many commands require authentication, the report indicates that TALOS-2021-1420 can potentially be used to bypass authentication, allowing unauthenticated exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities.
- **Knowledge of API endpoint and command:** The attacker must know the URL path (`/cgi-bin/api.cgi`), the specific command to be executed (in this case `SetIrLights`) as well as how the JSON is parsed by the application.

**Specific details for CVE-2021-44382:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `SetIrLights` command's parameter parsing.
- The `param` field is expected to be a JSON object, but sending a string (e.g., "") will trigger the assert at the code level and a crash.
- The provided example demonstrates how to send a crafted JSON payload with a string instead of an object in the param field.
