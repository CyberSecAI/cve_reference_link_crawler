Subject: Expat 2.6.2 released, includes security fixes

<https://blog.hartwork.org/posts/expat-2-6-2-released/> (published 2024-03-13)
announces the release of Expat 2.6.2, with security fixes:

> Regarding actual release content, most importantly, this release fixes the
> security issue CVE-2024-28757 that can be used to cause denial of service
> for code like…
>
>     XML_Parser parser = XML_ParserCreate(NULL);
>     XML_Parser ext_parser
>       = XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate(parser, NULL, NULL);
>     enum XML_Status status
>       = XML_Parse(ext_parser, doc, (int)strlen(doc), XML_TRUE);
>
> …where all input is sent to the external parser and none to the parent
> regular parser.
>
> The commit message of commit 1d50b80cf31de87750103656f6eb693746854aa8
> explains the problem and solution in more detail.
>
> There is also a bugfix to reject direct parameter entity recursion and to
> avoid the related undefined behavior. The issue was uncovered by
> ClusterFuzz/OSS-Fuzz after 20+ years of being unreported; that speaks
> volumes for the value of fuzzing.

The blog also points to the call for help maintaining libexpat in the Changelog
at <https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_6_2/expat/Changes> which notes
that items that need someone to work on include:

!! - <blink>fixing a complex non-public security issue</blink>,              !!

!! - teaming up on researching and fixing future security reports and        !!
!!   ClusterFuzz findings with few-days-max response times in communication  !!
!!   in order to (1) have a sound fix ready before the end of a 90 days      !!
!!   grace period and (2) in a sustainable manner,                           !!
