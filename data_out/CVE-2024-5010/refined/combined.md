CWE-200 - Information Exposure

##### DETAILS

WhatsUp Gold is a network monitoring and management software developed by Progress. WhatsUp Gold is designed to provide visibility into IT infrastructure, allowing organizations to monitor the performance and health of networks, devices, servers, applications, and other critical components. It offers features such as network mapping, performance monitoring, alerting, and reporting to help IT professionals ensure the optimal functioning of their network infrastructure.

The `TestController` endpoint is available to unauthenticated users and it discloses sensitive information through certain actions.

#### CVE-2024-5010 - Devices Information Disclosure

One of the `TestController` action sensitive informations disclosed do unauthenticated users is `Devices`.
By sending the following request :

```
