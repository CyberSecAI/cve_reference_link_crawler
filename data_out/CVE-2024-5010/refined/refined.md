- **Lack of Authentication:** The endpoint is accessible without requiring any authentication, allowing any attacker to retrieve sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain lists of monitored devices and network interfaces, which can include device names and IP addresses.
- **Potential for further attacks:** The disclosed information can be used for reconnaissance and targeted attacks against the monitored infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `TestController` endpoint to trigger the information disclosure.
    - `/NmConsole/Wug/Test/Devices` for device information
    - `/NmConsole/Wug/Test/NetworkInterfaces` for network interface information

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
