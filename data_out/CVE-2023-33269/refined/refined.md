Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `options` parameter within the WGET check function of the DTS Monitoring system. Specifically, the system fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary OS commands.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **OS Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a blind OS command injection vulnerability. The system executes the provided options directly, without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the DTS Monitoring system. This can lead to complete compromise of the system and potentially the network it resides on. The provided example shows execution of a Sliver implant, demonstrating complete control over the affected system.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Remote, over HTTP:** The attack vector is remote, using HTTP POST requests to the `/ajax.php` endpoint. The vulnerable parameter `options` is part of the `check_params` within the POST data.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the DTS Monitoring system's web interface.
    * **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    * **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs knowledge of the `options` parameter and its use in the WGET check.
    * **No authentication required for the specific request:** The request uses a cookie, but the specific cookie isn't analyzed for permissions in this context.

**Summary of the Exploit:**
The attacker sends a POST request to `/ajax.php` with the `options` parameter within `check_params` containing the payload. The payload uses command substitution `| $(./COMPLEX_CREATIVE)` which executes the `COMPLEX_CREATIVE` binary.
