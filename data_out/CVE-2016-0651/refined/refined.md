Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2016-0651 is an unspecified vulnerability within the "Optimizer" component of the MariaDB server. The specific flaw is not detailed in the provided context, but it's related to how the optimizer processes certain SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The weakness is in the optimizer component, which implies a logical error in how the query optimization logic is handled within the MariaDB server. This could include issues with memory management, improper data validation, or incorrect query plan generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is to cause a denial of service (DoS). The content states that the unspecified vulnerability allows local users to affect availability. This indicates that a successful attack would likely lead to a crash of the MariaDB server, making the database unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector for this CVE is through the execution of specially crafted SQL queries that specifically target the optimizer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute SQL queries against the MariaDB database. This suggests that the attacker needs a valid account and the appropriate permissions to interact with the database server.
