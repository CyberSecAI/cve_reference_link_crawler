- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The login page of Connectwise Control version 22.8.10013.8329 does not implement HSTS headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of HSTS headers on the login page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By not enforcing HTTPS via HSTS, the login page is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker can intercept the initial HTTP request, and redirect the user to a malicious page.
- **Attack vectors**: MITM attacks on the initial login request to Connectwise Control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user and the Connectwise Control server during the initial login attempt.
