Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from how deep links are handled on large screen devices. When a deep link is used, a homepage activity is started on the left pane, and the target activity is started on the right pane. This process overrides the calling package, preventing the target activity from knowing who initially called it.
- Specifically, when the "Connected devices" page is launched via a deep link from an unintended app on large screen devices, the bluetooth discoverability setting may not be correctly managed because the calling package information is lost.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Calling Package Identification:** The primary weakness is the loss of the initial calling package information due to the deep link flow.
- **Missing Access Control:** The "Connected devices" page relies on knowing the calling package to make bluetooth not discoverable. The deep link flow bypasses this access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The impact is classified as "High" and involves information disclosure. Specifically, the Bluetooth discoverability settings may be bypassed, potentially allowing other devices to discover the vulnerable device when it should not be. This is possible because the Bluetooth settings are not being properly controlled when an unintended app launches it via deep link.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Deep Links:** The attack vector is through the use of deep links on large-screen devices.
- **Unintended Apps:** An attacker needs to utilize an unintended app to start the "Connected devices" page activity via a deep link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to craft or utilize an app capable of launching a deep link to the "Connected devices" page on a large screen Android device.
- The attacker must be able to install and run an app on the target device to initiate the deep link.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves storing the initial calling package in the intent, so that the "Connected devices" page can determine the origin of the call and enforce Bluetooth discoverability settings appropriately.
- The provided commit message indicates the fix was introduced to prevent unintended apps from bypassing bluetooth discoverability settings.
