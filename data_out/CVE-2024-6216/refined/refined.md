Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6216

**Vulnerability Description:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection found in the "add-users.php" file of the Sourcecodester Food Ordering Management System version 1.0.

**Root Cause:**
*   **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:** The `contact` parameter in `add-users.php` is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Use of Plain SQL Queries:** The application uses plain SQL queries instead of prepared statements, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  Specifically, a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability is present in the `contact` parameter of the `add-users.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete data breach of the entire database on the system. An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `contact` parameter in a POST request to `add-users.php`.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability can be exploited via the web interface by navigating to the add users page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the contact parameter in `add-users.php` is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Requests:** The attacker should be able to intercept and modify HTTP POST requests, often using tools like Burp Suite.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameter is 'contact'.
*   The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.
*   The attacker can use tools like sqlmap to verify the vulnerability and exploit it.
*   The vulnerability is located in `add-users.php`
*   The application uses plain SQL queries, instead of parameterized queries.

**Demonstration:**
The provided content also includes a demonstration of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
1.  Intercept the traffic to `add-users.php` using Burp Suite.
2.  Save the intercepted request as a text file.
3.  Use `sqlmap` to confirm the vulnerability.
4.  `sqlmap` can then be used to list databases.
