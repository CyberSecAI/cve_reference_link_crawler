  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, executes unwanted actions in the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into executing an action (e.g., clicking a link or submitting a form). The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target application."
