For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-hyperflex-rce-TjjNrkpR>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco HyperFlex HX Software.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2021-1497: Cisco HyperFlex HX Installer Virtual Machine Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex HX Installer Virtual Machine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack against an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device as the *root* user.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvx36014](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx36014), [CSCvx36019](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx36019)CVE ID: CVE-2021-1497Security Impact Rating (SIR): CriticalCVSS Base Score: 9.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2021-1498: Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack against an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device as the *tomcat8* user.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvx37435](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx37435)CVE ID: CVE-2021-1498Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in this section.       | Cisco HyperFlex HX Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 4.0 | Migrate to 4.0(2e) |   | 4.0 | 4.0(2e) |   | 4.5 | 4.5(2a) |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * In November 2021, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) became aware of additional attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability.  Source  * Cisco would like to thank Nikita Abramov and Mikhail Klyuchnikov of Positive Technologies for reporting these vulnerabilities.
