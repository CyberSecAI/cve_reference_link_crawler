Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-10004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to how Firefox for iOS handles the display of the HTTPS padlock icon when opening external links to HTTP websites.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is an incorrect display of the HTTPS padlock icon. Specifically, when Firefox for iOS is launched and has previously had an HTTPS tab open, opening an external link to an HTTP website may incorrectly show the HTTPS padlock indicator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is considered "moderate". The vulnerability could mislead users into believing that a website is secure (HTTPS) when it is actually not (HTTP). This could lead to a user entering sensitive information on an insecure site, as they are under the false impression that the connection is secure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves opening an external link (e.g., a link from another app or a message) to an HTTP website using Firefox for iOS. The vulnerability is triggered under specific conditions related to the previous state of the browser having an HTTPS tab open prior to closing the browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on an external link that leads to an HTTP website, while the user has previously closed the browser and the browser had an HTTPS tab open in its prior session. The vulnerability is triggered locally within the user's application when the app is re-opened and loads an external HTTP link.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Firefox for iOS.
- The issue is fixed in Firefox for iOS version 131.2
- The bug report related to this issue is Bug 1904885
