In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: sg: Avoid sg device teardown race

sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() must not use sg_device_destroy() after calling
scsi_device_put().

sg_device_destroy() is accessing the parent scsi_device request_queue which
will already be set to NULL when the preceding call to scsi_device_put()
removed the last reference to the parent scsi_device.

The resulting NULL pointer exception will then crash the kernel.
