- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SINEMA Remote Connect Server's Client Communication component lacks proper brute force protection against user credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts (CWE-307).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially learn user credentials that are vulnerable to brute-force attacks, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the Client Communication component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific privileges or user interaction is needed. An attacker can perform the attack remotely over the network.
