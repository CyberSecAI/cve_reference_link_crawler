|  | Topic: Administrator can exploit XSS into local file read using PDF generator in Zkteco Biotime |
|  |  |
|  | Category: Zkteco Biotime |
|  | Module: webgui |
|  | Announced: 01-09-2022 |
|  | Credits: Ahmed Kameran From https://technobase.krd/ -- https://twitter.com/hamoshwani |
|  | CVE ID: CVE-2022-38802 |
|  | Affects: BioTime - < 8.5.3 Build:20200816.447 |
|  | Corrected: BioTime - > 8.5.3 Build:20200816.447 |
|  |  |
|  | 1. Background |
|  |  |
|  | BioTime 8.0 is a powerful web-based time and attendance management software that provides a stable connection to ZKTeco's |
|  | standalone push communication devices by Ethernet/Wi-Fi/GPRS/3G and working as a private cloud to |
|  | offer employee self-service by mobile application and web browser. |
|  |  |
|  | 2. Problem Description |
|  |  |
|  | A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities was found in |
|  | BioTime BioTime - < 8.5.3 Build:20200816.447 that could lead to local file read when you try to export injected payload using pdf |
|  | the pdf generator will simply execute the javascript code inside the injected payload that can lead to Local file read |
|  |  |
|  | Vulenrable models: |
|  |  |
|  | 1- When reassigning an employee |
|  | Path:/personnel/resign/action/ |
|  | Parameter: reason |
|  |  |
|  | 2- When send private message |
|  | path:/iclock/privatemessage/action/ |
|  | parameter:content |
|  |  |
|  | 3-When adding manual log |
|  | path:/att/manuallog/action/ |
|  | parameter:reason |
|  |  |
|  | 4-When adding timetable |
|  | path:/att/timeinterval/action/ |
|  | parameter:alias |
|  |  |
|  | 5-When adding shift |
|  | path:/att/attshift/add/ |
|  | parameter:alias |
|  | This got reflected when adding department schedule and employee schedule |
|  |  |
|  | 6-Xss when adding leave,manuallog,overtime,training |
|  | same parameter (reason) |
|  |  |
|  | 7-When adding holiday |
|  | path:/att/holiday/action/ |
|  | parameter:alias |
|  |  |
|  | 3. Impact |
|  |  |
|  | Due to the lack of proper encoding on the affected parameters susceptible to |
|  | XSS, arbitrary JavaScript could be executed by pdf generator's headless browser that could lead to local file read |
|  |  |
|  | 4. Solution |
|  |  |
|  | Users can upgrade to 8.5.4 or later. |
|  | Please find latest version from the Zkteco main website or they provide hardcopy of the software when you buy an Iface or any attendance devices make sure |
|  | You install versions higher than 8.5.3 |
