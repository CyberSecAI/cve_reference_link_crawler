CVE-2024-41927

Description of vulnerabilities

➢  Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CVE-2024-41927)

If an attacker sends specific commands via the PLC's serial communications port, they may be able to

obtain user authentication information.

➢  Generation of Predictable Identifiers (CVE-2024-28957)

Some of the IDs included in the headers of packets sent by the affected product may be predicted, resulting

in the disruption of communications.

24-R&D-0256

Impact

➢  Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CVE-2024-41927)

By obtaining sensitive information such as user authentication information from communication data, it is

possible that the PLC's program can be obtained, and the PLC may be operated illegally.

➢  Generation of Predictable Identifiers (CVE-2024-28957)

There is a possibility that communications may be disrupted if an attacker uses predicted values for some

of the IDs included in the headers of communication packets.

Mitigations/Workarounds

➢  Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CVE-2024-41927)

Administer the PLC properly to prevent attackers from connecting to the PLC's serial communications

port.

➢  Generation of Predictable Identifiers (CVE-2024-28957)

In order to minimize the risk of these vulnerabilities being exploited, please use a closed network such as a

dedicated network or VPN. For details, please refer to the Security Precaution on our website.
