CVE-2024-41927

Description of vulnerabilities

➢  Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CVE-2024-41927)

If an attacker sends specific commands via the PLC's serial communications port, they may be able to

obtain user authentication information.

➢  Generation of Predictable Identifiers (CVE-2024-28957)

Some of the IDs included in the headers of packets sent by the affected product may be predicted, resulting

in the disruption of communications.

24-R&D-0256

Impact

➢  Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CVE-2024-41927)

By obtaining sensitive information such as user authentication information from communication data, it is

possible that the PLC's program can be obtained, and the PLC may be operated illegally.

➢  Generation of Predictable Identifiers (CVE-2024-28957)

There is a possibility that communications may be disrupted if an attacker uses predicted values for some

of the IDs included in the headers of communication packets.

Countermeasures for Customers

The fixed products and software versions are as follows.

Product name

FC6A Series MICROSmart All-in-One CPU module

FC6B Series MICROSmart All-in-One CPU module

FC6A Series MICROSmart Plus CPU module

FC6B Series MICROSmart Plus CPU module

FT1A Series SmartAXIS Pro/Lite

Software version

Ver.2.70 and later

Ver.2.70 and later

Ver.2.50 and later

Ver.2.70 and later

Ver.2.50 and later

Please download the latest version of each software from our website and update it.

Mitigations/Workarounds

➢  Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CVE-2024-41927)

Administer the PLC properly to prevent attackers from connecting to the PLC's serial communications

port.

➢  Generation of Predictable Identifiers (CVE-2024-28957)

In order to minimize the risk of these vulnerabilities being exploited, please use a closed network such as a

dedicated network or VPN. For details, please refer to the Security Precaution on our website.

# JVNVU#96959731 Multiple vulnerabilities in IDEC PLCs

## Overview

IDEC PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) contain multiple vulnerabilities.

## Products Affected

**CVE-2024-41927**

* FC6A Series MICROSmart All-in-One CPU module Ver.2.60 and earlier
* FC6B Series MICROSmart All-in-One CPU module Ver.2.60 and earlier
* FC6A Series MICROSmart Plus CPU module Ver.2.40 and earlier
* FC6B Series MICROSmart Plus CPU module Ver.2.60 and earlier
* FT1A Series SmartAXIS Pro/Lite Ver.2.41 and earlier

**CVE-2024-28957**

* FC6B Series MICROSmart All-in-One CPU module Ver.2.60 and earlier
* FC6A Series MICROSmart Plus CPU module Ver.2.40 and earlier
* FC6B Series MICROSmart Plus CPU module Ver.2.60 and earlier

## Description

Multiple PLCs provided by IDEC Corporation contain multiple vulnerabilities listed below.

* **Cleartext transmission of sensitive informationï¼[CWE-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)ï¼**
  + CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N Base Score 4.6
  + CVE-2024-41927
* **Generation of predictable identifiersï¼[CWE-340](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/340.html)ï¼**
  + CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L Base Score 5.3
  + CVE-2024-28957
  + This vulnerability comes from Cente middleware used in the PLCs

## Impact
