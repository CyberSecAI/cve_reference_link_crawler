Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-36832, which affects the "Ultimate Membership Pro" WordPress plugin:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing low-privileged users (like subscribers) to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators or higher-level users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Data Export Vulnerability:**
    *   A low-privileged user can initiate an export of sensitive data, including:
        *   Usernames, emails, IP addresses, hashed passwords, and user roles
        *   Database tables including user data, order information, security logs, notification settings, invitation codes, coupons, payment debug data, tax information and post metadata.
        *   This data is exported to an XML file without proper authorization.
2.  **Authentication Bypass Vulnerability:**
    *   An attacker can generate a direct login link for any user (including administrators) by providing either their username or user ID.
    *   The generated link allows direct login without requiring any actual user credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Account Takeover:** Attackers can bypass authentication and directly log in as any user, including administrators.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access and steal sensitive information, including user credentials, personal details, and potentially payment information.
*   **Complete control over the website:** Once logged in as admin the attacker can perform any administrative task, including arbitrary code execution by installing malicious plugins/themes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over the internet.
*   **AJAX Requests:** The attack is performed by sending crafted POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to have a low-privileged account on the affected WordPress site (e.g., a subscriber account). This can be obtained by self-registering on the site, or by compromising an existing user with low privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Usernames or IDs:** For the authentication bypass, the attacker needs either the username or user ID of the target user, however, the username and ids can be extracted by exploiting the data export vulnerability first.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are present in versions 7.3 to 8.6 (exclusive) of the "Ultimate Membership Pro" plugin.
*   The vulnerabilities were addressed in version 8.6.1
*   The issue was initially reported as possibly stemming from a nulled version of the plugin, but was later confirmed to be a valid vulnerability in the legitimate plugin.
*   Wordfence has blocked a significant number of attacks targeting this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
