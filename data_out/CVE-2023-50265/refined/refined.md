Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50265:

**CVE-2023-50265: Arbitrary file read in `/api/swaggerui/static` endpoint**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/api/swaggerui/static` endpoint in `bazarr/app/ui.py` does not properly validate the user-controlled `filename` variable. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path and read arbitrary files by using path traversal techniques. The `filename` is passed to the `send_file` function without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input used in file path construction, allowing directory traversal.
    *   **Uncontrolled Resource Access:** The application allows access to system resources through a publicly accessible endpoint.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the system where the Bazarr application is running. This could expose sensitive information like configuration files, database credentials, or even system files.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker sends a GET request to the vulnerable `/api/swaggerui/static` endpoint.
    *   The attacker manipulates the `filename` parameter to include path traversal sequences like `../../` to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the Bazarr application.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) showing how to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `swaggerui_static` method within `bazarr/app/ui.py`.
*   The issue was found using the CodeQL query "Uncontrolled data used in path expression".
*   A fix for this vulnerability was included in commit `17add7fbb3ae1919a40d505470d499d46df9ae6b`, which adds path validation to check if the constructed path is still within the intended base path.

The content also refers to two other vulnerabilities:
*   CVE-2023-50264, which is an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the `/system/backup/download/` endpoint.
*   CVE-2023-50266, which is a Blind SSRF vulnerability in the `/test/<protocol>/` endpoint.
