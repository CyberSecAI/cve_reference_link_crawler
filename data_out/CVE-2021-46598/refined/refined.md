Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-46598:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of JT files. This inadequate validation leads to a memory corruption condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption (specifically, out-of-bounds and use-after-free conditions).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a user opening a maliciously crafted JT file in Bentley MicroStation CONNECT or visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable parsing logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious JT file that exploits the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to lure a user into opening this malicious JT file or visiting a malicious page with the exploit.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Bentley MicroStation CONNECT and Bentley View.
- The vulnerability is addressed in versions 10.16.02.\* and later.
- The vulnerability was reported to Bentley on 2021-10-01 and publicly released on 2022-01-31.
