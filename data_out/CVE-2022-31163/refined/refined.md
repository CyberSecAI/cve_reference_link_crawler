{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `TZInfo::Timezone.get` function in the tzinfo gem failed to properly validate timezone identifiers, specifically allowing newline characters. This, in combination with the use of `require` to load timezone data files, allowed an attacker to inject relative paths and load arbitrary files outside the intended timezone data directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal (CWE-23)",
       "Improper Input Validation (CWE-625)",
       "Untrusted Search Path (CWE-641)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file loading and execution within the Ruby process. This could lead to remote code execution if an attacker can control the content of the loaded file.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can provide a crafted timezone identifier containing newline characters and relative path components to `TZInfo::Timezone.get`. If user input is used for the timezone identifier, this can be exploited remotely.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the timezone identifier passed to `TZInfo::Timezone.get`. This could be through a web application or other system that uses the tzinfo gem and allows user-controlled input for the timezone."
