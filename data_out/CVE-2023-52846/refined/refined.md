The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52846.

**Root cause:**
The `prp_fill_rct()` function, which is used in `prp_create_tagged_frame()`, can fail and free the socket buffer (skb), returning NULL. The original code in `prp_create_tagged_frame()` did not check the return value of `prp_fill_rct()`, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability when `prp_fill_rct()` fails but the code continues to use the previously freed skb.

**Vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free

**Impact:**
-  A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to various issues, including crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution by an attacker.

**Attack vector:**
- Triggering a failure in `prp_fill_rct()`. The specific conditions that cause a failure in this function are not detailed in the provided context but involve the handling of Rapid Control Protocol (RCP) tagged frames within the High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) protocol implementation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send network packets that are processed by the vulnerable code path in the HSR implementation and cause the `prp_fill_rct()` function to fail.
