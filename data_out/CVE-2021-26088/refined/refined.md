Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from improper authentication within the Fortinet Single Sign-On (FSSO) Collector component. Specifically, the FSSO DC Agent and Collector communicate insecurely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-287 Improper Authentication:** The core issue is that the FSSO Collector does not properly authenticate login notification packets received from DC agents.
*   **Insecure Communication:** The vulnerability highlights the insecure nature of communication between FSSO DC Agents and the FSSO Collector. Specifically, the use of unauthenticated UDP login notification packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypass Authentication:** An unauthenticated attacker can bypass firewall authentication rules.
*   **Unauthorized Network Access:** By sending crafted UDP login notifications, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the protected network, as the FSSO Collector processes these unauthenticated login notifications.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Proximity:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the FSSO Collector.
*   **Crafted UDP Packets:** Attackers must send specifically crafted UDP login notification packets to the FSSO Collector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the FSSO Collector
*   **Packet Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send UDP packets.

**Affected Products:**
*   Any FSSO DC Agent and Collector released with FortiOS 7.0.0 or below.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade the FSSO DC Agent and Collector to any version released with FortiOS 7.0.1 or above.
*   Upgrade the FSSO DC Agent and Collector to any version released with FortiOS 6.4.6 or above.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSSv3 score of 6.7.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jerome Dupuis.
