The Butterfly Button

Imagine a world where every website and app makes information, assistance and support available, anonymously without leaving any traces ‚Äì at the click of a button.

The butterfly button is a feature that can be easily installed on any application and website in the world. The button opens a secure digital platform that offers advice and support in a discreet and anonymous way, without leaving any traces on the applicant‚Äôs device.

Our vision is to reach hundreds of thousands of websites and apps, and be a brand recognized worldwide for domestic violence prevention. The system is designed so that if anyone is in any form of domestic distress, they can report and request help with a simple button press, with maximum discretion.

#### The goal - to help anyone who has experienced violence, to reach every victim and every aggressor.

#### Imagine a situation where every possible application provides information, assistance and contacting relevant parties regarding domestic violence accessible with the click of a button, and all this without leaving a trace.Imagine a situation where every website has the same button and all its actions do not appear in the browsing history.

#### Today you no longer have to imagine!
