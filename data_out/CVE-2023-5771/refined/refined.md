- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the AdminUI of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability in the AdminUI
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when viewing quarantined messages. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted email with HTML in the subject. When a user views the quarantined message, the embedded HTML/JavaScript is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable system. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, but a user needs to view the message to execute the code.
