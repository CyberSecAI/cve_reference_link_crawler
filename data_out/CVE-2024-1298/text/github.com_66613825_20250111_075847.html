# Temporary DoS vulnerability in FirmwarePerformancePei

Moderate

[jkmathews](/jkmathews)
published
GHSA-chfw-xj8f-6m53
May 31, 2024

## Package

MdeModulePkg
(EDK2)

## Affected versions

<=202405

## Patched versions

202405

## Description

### Summary

Temporary DoS during PEI S3 resume.

This vulnerability is tracked under <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4677>.

Binarly BRLY-2023-021

<https://github.com/binarly-io/Vulnerability-REsearch/blob/main/EDK2/BRLY-2023-021.md>

### Details

MdeModulePkg/Universal/Acpi/FirmwarePerformanceDataTablePei/FirmwarePerformancePei.c

An attacker with the ability to modify physical memory can control the value of AcpiS3ResumeRecord->ResumeCount. If the attacker sets the value of ResumeCount to MAX\_UINT32 (0xFFFFFFFF), and ResumeCount is subsequently incremented, its new value will be 0 (due to UINT32 overflow). Since there is no check for overflow, when ResumeCount is 0 and passed as the second argument to DivU64x32(), it will trigger a division by 0, and cause a system crash, leading to a DoS.

### Impact

System crash, leading to a temporary DoS.

### Mitigation release plan

Patch file is available now via <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4677>.

This patch was integrated in the May 2024 EDK2 release ([edk2-stable202405](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable202405)).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
