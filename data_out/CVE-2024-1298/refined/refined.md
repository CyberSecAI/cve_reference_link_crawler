Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1298

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `FirmwarePerformancePei.c` file within the EDK2 MdeModulePkg.
- The `AcpiS3ResumeRecord->ResumeCount` variable is not checked for overflow, leading to a division by zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The `ResumeCount` variable, a UINT32, can be manipulated to overflow when incremented after reaching its maximum value (0xFFFFFFFF). This results in the value wrapping to 0.
- **Division by Zero:** The wrapped `ResumeCount` value (0) is used as the second argument in the `DivU64x32()` function, resulting in a division by zero error.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the value of  `AcpiS3ResumeRecord->ResumeCount` before using it in the division operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** The division by zero triggers a system crash.
- **Temporary Denial of Service (DoS):** The system crash leads to a temporary denial of service, preventing normal system operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Memory Modification:** An attacker needs the ability to modify physical memory to control the value of `AcpiS3ResumeRecord->ResumeCount`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to modify physical memory.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to perform the memory modification.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is related to S3 resume process during PEI phase.
- The vulnerability is tracked under Bugzilla ID 4677.
- The issue was also assigned the identifier BRLY-2023-021 by Binarly.
- The fix was integrated into the May 2024 EDK2 release (edk2-stable202405).
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.0.
- The vulnerability has a CWE identifier of CWE-369 (Division by Zero).
- Fedora has released updates for Fedora 39 and Fedora 40 to address this vulnerability.
