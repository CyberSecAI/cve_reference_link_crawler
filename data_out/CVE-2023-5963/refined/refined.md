- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Excessive OR terms in search queries, specifically for group searches, but also possible in global and project searches, leading to high CPU usage on search nodes. This eventually caused the system to stop serving search requests. The search functionality utilizes Elasticsearch, and the excessive use of OR operators causes performance issues.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation or limitations on the number of operators allowed in search queries. The system is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to the performance impact of complex search queries with many OR clauses.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service, causing search functionality to become unavailable due to high CPU usage and system overload.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending search requests with a large number of OR operators in the query. This can be done through the GitLab web interface or potentially through other means of interacting with the search API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only requires the ability to perform search queries and the knowledge of the system's vulnerability to complex searches.
