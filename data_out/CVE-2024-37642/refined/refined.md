- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sprintf` function is used to copy the `v3` parameter to the `v6` buffer without proper filtering of special characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow and command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/boafrm/formSystemCheck` endpoint. The `ipv4_ping` parameter is used to inject commands through the vulnerable `sprintf` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, and be on the same network or have access to the device's web interface. The attacker needs to know the device's IP address and how to craft a specific post request.
