## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Call Now Button < 1.4.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to All Buttons, and add a button.
2. Select "Button action" as Link and insert the following payload: javascript:alert(document.cookie);
3. Set the Open link in the "Current window".
4. Visit the website and click on the button.
5. The alert will trigger.

### Affects Plugins
