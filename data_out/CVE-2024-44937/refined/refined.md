The provided content relates to CVE-2024-44937.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a race condition in the `intel-vbtn` ACPI notify handler. This handler, which is responsible for registering input devices when a virtual button event occurs, could be executed concurrently on multiple CPU cores after commit e2ffcda16290.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of synchronization mechanisms within the `notify_handler()` function. Multiple instances of this handler running concurrently can cause the same input device (`priv->switches_dev`) to be registered multiple times.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this race condition leads to several issues:
   - Duplicate input device registration, resulting in sysfs errors ("cannot create duplicate filename").
   - The failure of `kobject_add_internal` due to the duplicate name,
   - Finally, a kernel NULL pointer dereference and subsequent system crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is an ACPI notify event, specifically triggered on Dell Venue 7140 tablets when undocking from the keyboard.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger the ACPI notify event, which in the described case is the undocking of a specific tablet. This does not require elevated privileges, but physical access to the vulnerable device or the ability to emulate such an undocking event on the specific hardware is required.
