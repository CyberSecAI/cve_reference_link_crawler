Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-41802:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A kernel stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `kernel_liteos_a` subsystem when the `SysClockGetres` function is called.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Kernel stack overflow, specifically a 4-byte padding data from kernel stack is incorrectly copied to user space, resulting in a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can leak 4 bytes of data from the kernel stack to user space. While the direct impact might seem limited to information disclosure, further exploitation could potentially lead to more severe issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `SysClockGetres` function, which is accessible via a syscall to the kernel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code that can make syscalls to the kernel. This could be achieved through a malicious application running on the affected device.

**Affected Versions:**
- OpenHarmony-v3.1-Release through OpenHarmony-v3.1.4-Release
- OpenHarmony-v3.0-LTS through OpenHarmony-v3.0.6-LTS
- OpenHarmony-v1.1.0-LTS through OpenHarmony-v1.1.5-LTS
