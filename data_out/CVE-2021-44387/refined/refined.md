The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44387.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser not properly validating the structure of the JSON input, specifically within the `param` field. The parser assumes that the `param` element will always be a JSON object, but it does not enforce this. When a non-object value (like a string) is provided, the program attempts to access it using the subscription operator, leading to an assertion failure and the eventual reboot of the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation for the `param` JSON element, failing to check if it's a JSON object before attempting to access its members.
- **Type Confusion:** The code assumes the `param` field is always a JSON object, causing a type mismatch when it receives another type, such as a string or an empty value.
- **Lack of Error Handling:** The code does not gracefully handle the assertion failure when the `param` is not a JSON object, leading to the termination of the `cgiserver.cgi` process, and then a device reboot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes, and the device reboots, disrupting its normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON payload containing a non-object value for the `param` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device.
- While some of the affected APIs require authentication, it's noted that the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication by using TALOS-2021-1420 as a prerequisite.

Specifically for CVE-2021-44387:
- The `SetPtzPreset` command is vulnerable. The `param` field, when set to a non-object value (e.g., ""), causes a crash when parsed.

```
[
    {
        "cmd": "SetPtzPreset",
        "action": 0,
        "param":  ""
    }
]
```
