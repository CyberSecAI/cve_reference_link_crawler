Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6266

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `${}` within the `SysDictDataMapper.xml` file to directly pass user-supplied parameters (`text`, `code`, and `table`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw due to the unsafe use of string interpolation with `${}` in the XML mapper, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, an attacker might be able to gain more control over the system or execute arbitrary commands.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** In certain scenarios, a malicious SQL query could be used to slow down the database or even crash it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `/system/dictData/loadDictItem/{{dictCode}}` endpoint. The `text`, `code`, and `table` parameters are passed through the URL path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's endpoint.
- **Understanding of Application Structure:** Some understanding of the application's structure to know the vulnerable endpoint.

**Technical Details:**
1. The vulnerability exists in `com/pearadmin/modules/sys/mapper/xml/SysDictDataMapper.xml`, where `${}` is used to pass user-controlled parameters (`text`, `code`, `table`) into an SQL query.
2. The `queryTableDictByKeys` method in `com/pearadmin/modules/sys/mapper/SysDictDataMapper.java` is vulnerable.
3. This method is called within the `SysDictDataServiceImpl.java`.
4. The `/system/dictData/loadDictItem/{{dictCode}}` endpoint within `SysDictDataController.java` takes the vulnerable parameters from the URL and passes them to the vulnerable mapper.
5. A sample payload is provided: `http://localhost:8088/system/dictData/loadDictItem/sys\_user,user(),1?key=1` demonstrating how the injected SQL `user()` is executed.

**Affected Versions:**
- Pear Admin Boot versions <= 2.0.2 are vulnerable.
