## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# JetBackup < 2.0.9.9 - Directory Listing Exposing Backups

### Description

The plugin doesn't use index files to prevent public directory listing of sensitive directories in certain configurations, which allows malicious actors to leak backup files.

A partial fix was released in 2.0.9.6, removing the ability to list the directory but still allowing direct access to the files by only guessing the timestamp of the backup.

### Proof of Concept

1) Run backup function http://your\_site/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=backup\_guard\_backups
2) When the scan is over, the attacker must sort through the directory "/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/jetbackup/\*", after which there will be a Directory Listing vulnerability in it, which will allow pumping out all backup and all logs. This vulnerability will be available if a person names the file in a simple way.
