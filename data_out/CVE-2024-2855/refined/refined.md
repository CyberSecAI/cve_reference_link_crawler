- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow in the `fromSetSysTime` function of the Tenda AC15 firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `sscanf` function is used to parse the `time` parameter from a POST request into several local variables (`v7` to `v12`). The size of the variables are insufficient to store user-controlled input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A stack buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request with a crafted `time` parameter to the `/goform/SetSysTimeCfg` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Tenda AC15 device. The attacker would need network connectivity to the device.
