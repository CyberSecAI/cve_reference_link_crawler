Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-26308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling" issue in Apache Commons Compress. Specifically, it occurs when unpacking a malformed Pack200 file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Allocation:** The software does not properly limit or throttle the resources allocated when processing a specially crafted Pack200 file. This leads to an excessive consumption of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service, due to the excessive memory consumption leading to an `OutOfMemoryError`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves providing a crafted, broken Pack200 file to an application that utilizes a vulnerable version of Apache Commons Compress.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed Pack200 file to an application using vulnerable versions of Apache Commons Compress. No special privileges are required, but the attacker needs a way to get the vulnerable application to process their crafted input.

**Additional Details from NetApp Advisory**

*   NetApp products that incorporate Apache Commons Compress versions 1.21 prior to 1.26.0 are affected.
*   The NetApp advisory lists specific products affected and not affected.
*   A fix is available in Apache Commons Compress version 1.26.0, which NetApp is incorporating into their affected products.

**Summary**
The core issue is a lack of input validation or resource limiting when processing Pack200 files, causing excessive memory consumption and potential Denial of Service.
