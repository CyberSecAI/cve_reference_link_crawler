### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v4.0...v4.1.0`

The fact of not sanitizing user input appended to a regular expression may lead to a `Regular Expression Denial of Service` by an attacker crafting a regular expression taking too much to load, or simply change the behaviour of the program.

Vulnerable code:
