- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows a non-administrator authenticated user to perform privilege escalation by tampering with the binaries of Easergy Studio. Specifically, the product fails to properly manage privileges, allowing unauthorized access to the installation directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the workstation. An attacker could elevate privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the file system of the workstation where Easergy Studio is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a non-admin authenticated user with access to the file system of the workstation where Easergy Studio is installed. The attacker needs to be able to tamper with the binaries of the software.
