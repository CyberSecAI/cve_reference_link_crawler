Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-30805:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of the username parameter within the login functionality of the Sangfor NGAF (Next-Generation Application Firewall).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The username, when processed by the `popen()` function for authentication, is directly injected into a shell command without proper sanitization, leading to OS command injection.
*   **Authentication Bypass (Indirect):**  The `RPAFheader Y-Forwarded-For` directive combined with a conditional check on `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` allows an attacker to bypass authentication checks by setting `Y-Forwarded-For` to `127.0.0.1` which opens up additional attack vectors.
*   **Local File Read:** The `loadfile.php` script allows arbitrary file reads due to insufficient path sanitization, allowing access to sensitive files on the server.
*   **Source Code Disclosure:**  An integer handling issue in the CGI handler allows disclosure of PHP source code when a non-numeric `Content-Length` header is provided.
*   **SQL Injection:** A function to add SSO users was vulnerable to SQL injection although the underlying DBMS is SQLite which limits the impact of the SQLi vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of the command injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web server process.
*   **Data Breaches:** The local file read vulnerability, combined with the source code disclosure could lead to the extraction of sensitive information such as session cookies and configuration details.
*   **Account Takeover:** The ability to add new SSO users via the database, and the SQL injection provides means of compromising existing accounts or creating new malicious ones.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can expose sensitive Active Directory information via the API

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:**  The primary attack vector is sending crafted HTTP requests to the Sangfor NGAF. Specifically:
    *   Sending a modified `Y-Forwarded-For` header to bypass authentication.
    *   Using the `/svpn_html/loadfile.php` endpoint to perform local file reads by manipulating the `file` parameter.
    *   Injecting commands via the username field in the login form to trigger the command injection via the `popen()` call.
    *  Injecting commands via `PHPSESSID` cookie in the login form to trigger RCE on port 4433.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Sangfor NGAF.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the web server on the appliance.
*  **No Authentication Required**: Exploitation of the command injection vulnerability in login flow can be achieved without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor (Sangfor) reportedly claimed these issues were either fixed or false positives, but did not provide details regarding patches or public advisories.
*   The `mod_security` configuration was present but did not prevent the command injection, indicating weaknesses in its rules.
* The device is described as an "AI-enabled" firewall, which highlights the need for security in even advanced tech.
* The exploitation on port 85 requires the attacker to truncate the shell command via a semi-colon whereas on port 4433 they leverage backticks to achieve RCE.
