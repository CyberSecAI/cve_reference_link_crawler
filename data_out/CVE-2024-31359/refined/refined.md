Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue. Specifically, the plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms within the plugin. This means that functions that should be restricted to specific user roles or capabilities are accessible to lower-privileged users.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  The impact of this vulnerability is described as having "low severity." While the specific impact is not detailed, it could potentially allow a user with minimal privileges (like a subscriber) to perform actions that they should not be able to. This could lead to unauthorized modifications or access to data within the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the missing access controls by directly calling the vulnerable function or action without proper authorization.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a user on the WordPress site with subscriber-level privileges. No special knowledge is stated beyond that required to interact with the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Premmerce Product Filter for WooCommerce plugin, versions 3.7.2 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.7.3.
*   The CVSS score is 4.3, which is considered low.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Broken Access Control" and is listed under OWASP Top 10 A1.
