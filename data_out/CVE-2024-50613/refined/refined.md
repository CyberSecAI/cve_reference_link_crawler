{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by a reachable assertion in the `mpeg_l3_encoder_close` function when processing a specially crafted input file. Specifically, the assertion occurs within a call to `lame_encode_buffer_ieee_double` in `mpeg_l3_encode.c:712` which is a part of libmp3lame, which is called by `libsndfile`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The assertion failure indicates that the program is encountering an unexpected state during the encoding process with certain crafted input files."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the assertion failure and program termination.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted input file (e.g., a malformed RIFF file) to `libsndfile` for processing.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted input file to an application using `libsndfile`."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided information includes the crash backtrace, ASAN log, and reproduction steps, allowing for a detailed understanding of the vulnerability. The issue was initially misattributed to line 304 of mpeg_l3_encode.c but was later corrected to line 712 in the comments."
