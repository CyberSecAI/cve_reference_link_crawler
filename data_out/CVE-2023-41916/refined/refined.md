Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41916:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper filtering of parameters in the DataSource Manager module of Apache Linkis. Specifically, the application does not adequately sanitize or blacklist malicious parameters within the MySQL JDBC URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation or sanitization for parameters in the MySQL JDBC URL.
- The application trusts user-supplied parameters in the JDBC URL without proper filtering, leading to a file read vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary file reading on the server where Apache Linkis is running by crafting a malicious MySQL JDBC URL within the DataSource Manager module.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the DataSource Manager module within Apache Linkis, where users can configure datasources.
- An attacker can manipulate the parameters in the MySQL JDBC URL field to point to arbitrary files on the server, thus reading file content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an authorized account within Linkis to be able to configure data sources.
- Access to the DataSource Manager module is required for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache Linkis versions <= 1.4.0
- The recommended solution is to upgrade to Linkis version 1.6.0 or later.
