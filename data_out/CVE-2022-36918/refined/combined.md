SECURITY-1468 / CVE-2022-36881
Git client Plugin 3.11.0 and earlier does not perform SSH host key
verification when connecting to Git repositories via SSH.

This lack of verification could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack
to intercept these connections.

SECURITY-284 / CVE-2022-36882 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-36883 (permission check) &
CVE-2022-36884 (information disclosure)
Git Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/git/notifyCommit` that can be
used to notify Jenkins of changes to an SCM repository. For its most basic
functionality, this endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will
schedule polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository. In
Git Plugin 4.11.3 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed with GET
requests and without authentication.

In addition to this basic functionality, the endpoint also accept a `sha1`
parameter specifying a commit ID. If this parameter is specified, jobs
configured with the specified repo will be triggered immediately, and the
build will check out the specified commit.

Additionally, the output of the webhook endpoint will provide information
about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs
the user has no permission to access.

This allows attackers with knowledge of Git repository URLs to trigger
builds of jobs using a specified Git repository and to cause them to check
out an attacker-specified commit, and to obtain information about the
existence of jobs configured with this Git repository.

Additionally, this webhook endpoint does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1849 / CVE-2022-36885

## Descriptions

### Missing hostname verification in Git client Plugin

**SECURITY-1468
/
CVE-2022-36881**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git-client`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client)**

**Description:**

Git client Plugin 3.11.0 and earlier does not perform SSH host key verification when connecting to Git repositories via SSH.

This lack of verification could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

Git client Plugin 3.11.1 provides strategies for performing host key verification for administrators to select the one that meets their security needs.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin#ssh-host-key-verification).

### Lack of authentication mechanism in Git Plugin webhook

**SECURITY-284
/
CVE-2022-36882 (CSRF), CVE-2022-36883 (permission check), CVE-2022-36884 (information disclosure)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

Git Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/git/notifyCommit` that can be used to notify Jenkins of changes to an SCM repository.
For its most basic functionality, this endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will schedule polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository.
In Git Plugin 4.11.3 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed with GET requests and without authentication.

In addition to this basic functionality, the endpoint also accept a `sha1` parameter specifying a commit ID.
If this parameter is specified, jobs configured with the specified repo will be triggered immediately, and the build will check out the specified commit.

Additionally, the output of the webhook endpoint will provide information about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs the user has no permission to access.

This allows attackers with knowledge of Git repository URLs to trigger builds of jobs using a specified Git repository and to cause them to check out an attacker-specified commit, and to obtain information about the existence of jobs configured with this Git repository.

Additionally, this webhook endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Git Plugin 4.11.4 requires a `token` parameter that authorizes requests to the webhook endpoint.
While GET requests remain allowed, attackers would need to be able to provide a webhook token.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin/#push-notification-from-repository).
