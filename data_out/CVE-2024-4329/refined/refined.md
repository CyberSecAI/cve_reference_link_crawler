Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'id' parameter within the Thim Elementor Kit plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the 'id' parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database. When a user accesses the page containing the injected code, it executes in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   **User Compromise:** When other users visit the affected page, the injected script will execute within their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via the plugin's interface.
*   **'id' parameter:** The 'id' parameter is the vulnerable entry point for injecting malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This indicates the attack is not available to unauthenticated users.
*   **Access to Plugin Settings:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the 'id' parameter, likely through the plugin's settings or widget configurations within the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional Details (from Wordfence):**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Thim Elementor Kit plugin up to and including 1.1.9.
*   The vulnerability was found by the researcher "stealthcopter."
*   A patched version (1.1.9.1) is available to fix the issue.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `inc/elementor/widgets/global/search-form.php`.
* The vulnerable parameter is used within the search form functionality
