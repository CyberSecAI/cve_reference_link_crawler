Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Parse Server handles file uploads, specifically when a file is uploaded without an extension. The server attempts to determine the file extension from the Content-Type header, but if no extension is present, the logic to handle this case leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Improper Input Validation:** The server lacks proper validation or handling for file uploads lacking extensions.
-   **Error Handling:** The server does not gracefully handle the missing file extension, resulting in a crash rather than a user-friendly error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can crash the server by uploading a file without an extension, leading to service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network-based:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Parse Server's file upload endpoint.
-   No special privileges or user interaction are required.

**Additional Details:**

-   The fix involves sanitizing the extension extracted from the Content-Type header, to prevent the crash from happening when the extension is empty.
-   The vulnerability is present in Parse Server version 1.0.0 and fixed in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.
-   The CVSS score is 7.5, with a network attack vector, low complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction and high availability impact.
