{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that containers were being started with a non-empty inheritable capabilities set, which is atypical for a Linux environment. This allowed programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Programs inside the container could gain inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set, which could lead to privilege escalation within the container, particularly impacting containers using Linux users and groups for privilege separation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the execution of programs within a container that have inheritable file capabilities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have the ability to execute programs inside a container and those programs would need to have inheritable file capabilities."
