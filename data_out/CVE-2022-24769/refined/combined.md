# Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty

Low

[thaJeztah](/thaJeztah)
published
GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq
Mar 24, 2022

## Package

docker

docker
([docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

< v20.10.14

## Patched versions

v20.10.14

## Description

### Impact

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.

This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.

### Patches

This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.

This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work. Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container's bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container's bounding set per the rules described in the manual page. In all cases the container's bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.

### Workarounds

The entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.

### Credits

The Moby project would like to thank [Andrew G. Morgan](https://github.com/AndrewGMorgan) for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [Moby security policy](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-3826c8f549
2022-05-07 04:08:14.315557
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : moby-engine
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 20.10.14
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <https://www.docker.com>
Summary : The open-source application container engine
Description :
Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run any application as a
lightweight container.

Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and
everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular
language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks
for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without
depending on a particular stack or provider.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

- Update to 20.10.14. Fixes rhbz#2063052. - Mitigate CVE-2022-24769.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-cac2323802
2022-04-26 06:56:41.093973
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : moby-engine
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 20.10.14
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <https://www.docker.com>
Summary : The open-source application container engine
Description :
Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run any application as a
lightweight container.

Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and
everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular
language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks
for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without
depending on a particular stack or provider.

Subject: CVE-2022-29162: runc < 1.1.2 incorrect handling of inheritable
 capabilities in default configuration

A security update for runc (v1.1.2) was released to mitigate
CVE-2022-29162, which is a low severity vulnerability related to
mishandling of inheritable capabilities which resulted in an atypical
Linux environment inside containers.

As the inheritable set was a subset of the permitted capabilities (which
are limited) this bug does not affect the container security boundary,
it simply ensures that programs running inside the container do not
inherit capabilities they do not need accidentally. This issue is
similar to CVE-2022-24769 which was found in Docker and containerd.

As this issue was deemed not exploitable, there is no embargo for this
patch and release. Please update as soon as practical.

You can find the new version of runc on our releases page[1] and the
patch fixing the issue is [2].

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-c07546070d
2022-04-26 07:30:06.746444
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : moby-engine
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 20.10.14
Release : 1.fc35
URL : <https://www.docker.com>
Summary : The open-source application container engine
Description :
Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run any application as a
lightweight container.

Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and
everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular
language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks
for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without
depending on a particular stack or provider.
