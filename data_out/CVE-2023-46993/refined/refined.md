```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `enable` parameter within the `setLedCfg` request is not properly validated, allowing for command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection due to lack of input sanitization on the 'enable' parameter in the `setLedCfg` function, which leads to arbitrary command execution through the `CsteSystem` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the target device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with a `setLedCfg` topic and a malicious `enable` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, indicating a network-accessible attack vector. The attacker should also know the path to `/wizard.html` in order to craft the malicious request."
