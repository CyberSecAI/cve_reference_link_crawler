#### People REALLY LOVE Beaver Builder

Don’t just take our word for it, here are a few testimonials from happy users and customers.

“Simply put, it is the best page builder in the WordPress ecosystem. There is no close second.” – WP Crafter

“Complete design freedom with no coding and it is all fully responsive as well.” – skyboro

“Easy to use, fast to get started, real product depth, great support.” – David Bressler

#### Modules And Widgets

We’ve loaded Beaver Builder up with a flexible set of content modules to aid you in building stunning layouts and landing pages within an intuitive drag and drop system. Beaver Builder also supports core and third party WordPress widgets and shortcodes, so you can use Beaver Builder with all your *other* favorite plugins!

#### A WordPress Page Builder That Works With Your Theme

Yep, that’s right! Beaver Builder was designed to work with almost any WordPress theme. Try Beaver Builder on your existing website today, or consider upgrading and using Beaver Builder’s outstanding framework theme (available in Pro and Agency packages) for your next project.

#### A WordPress Page Builder That’s 100% Mobile Friendly

Every part of a Beaver Builder layout or landing page is fully responsive and looks gorgeous on any screen size. Responsive web design has never been easier.

#### A WordPress Page Builder That’s Optimized For Performance

We’ve designed Beaver Builder to create layouts and landing pages that load quickly. Many page builders load in an ungodly number of scripts and stylesheets to every page on your site. Not Beaver Builder! It only loads the assets needed for a given layout or landing page.

#### ClassicPress

This plugin is compatible with [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/).

I was recommended this plugin for building pages, but I’ve actually ended up using it for blog posts too. It is so easy to use and looks great!

Beaver Builder is seriously the best! My wife has been using it to build websites for clients for the past 10 years. It’s super fast and really intuitive. It’s super stable and reliable. We never worry about any of our sites breaking after an update. Support Team is amazingly helpful too.

Beaver Builder is unbelievably slow. I’ve seen grass grow faster than the amount of time it takes to add a page element. This builder gives me a headache.
