    "summary": "The Beaver Builder plugin, in versions up to 2.8.3.5, is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the ‘type’ parameter on repeater fields, allowing authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts, which would then be executed when a user accesses the affected page. Version 2.8.3.6 addresses this issue."
