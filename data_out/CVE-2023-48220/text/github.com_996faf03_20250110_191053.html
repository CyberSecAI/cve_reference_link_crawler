## Security fixes

This release addresses several security issues:

* [CVE-2023-48220](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/security/advisories/GHSA-w3q8-m492-4pwp)
* [CVE-2023-47634](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/security/advisories/GHSA-r275-j57c-7mf2)

The details regarding the security vulnerability will be published on February 20th 2024, which is two months after the release date of this version. For more information, please refer to our [Security Policy](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/SECURITY.md).

## Upgrade notes

As usual, we recommend that you have a full backup, of the database, application code and static files.

To update, follow these steps:

1. Update your Gemfile:

```
gem "decidim", "0.26.9"
gem "decidim-dev", "0.26.9"
```

2. Run these commands to upgrade and make sure you get all the latest migrations:

```
bundle update decidim
bin/rails decidim:upgrade
bin/rails db:migrate
```

And then follow the steps and commands detailed in these notes.

### Deduplicating endorsements

We have identified a case when the same user can endorse the same resource multiple times. This is a bug that we have fixed in this release, but we need to clean up the existing duplicated endorsements. We have added a new task that helps you clean the duplicated endorsements.

```
bundle exec rails decidim:upgrade:fix_duplicate_endorsements
```

You can see more details about this change on PR [#11853](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/11853)
