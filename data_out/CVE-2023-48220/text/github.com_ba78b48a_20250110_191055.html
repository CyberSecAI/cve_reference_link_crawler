2.0.9

## Description

### Impact

The invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited amount of time through the password reset functionality.

When using the password reset functionality, the `devise_invitable` gem always accepts the pending invitation if the user has been invited as shown in this piece of code within the `devise_invitable` gem:

<https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable/blob/41f58970ff76fb64382a9b9ea1bd530f7c3adab2/lib/devise_invitable/models.rb#L198>

The only check done here is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for` expiry period as explained in the gem's documentation:

<https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable#model-configuration->

> `invite_for`: The period the generated invitation token is valid. After this period, the invited resource won’t be able to accept the invitation. When `invite_for` is `0` (the default), the invitation won’t expire.

Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this configuration should be respected:

[decidim/decidim-core/config/initializers/devise.rb](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/d2d390578050772d1bdb6d731395f1afc39dcbfc/decidim-core/config/initializers/devise.rb#L134)

Line 134
in
[d2d3905](/decidim/decidim/commit/d2d390578050772d1bdb6d731395f1afc39dcbfc)

|  | config.invite\_for = 2.weeks |
| --- | --- |

The bug is in the `devise_invitable` gem and should be fixed there and the dependency should be upgraded in Decidim once the fix becomes available.

### Patches

Update `devise_invitable` to version `2.0.9` or above by running the following command:

```
$ bundle update devise_invitable

```
### Workarounds

The invitations can be cancelled directly from the database by running the following command from the Rails console:

```
> Decidim::User.invitation_not_accepted.update_all(invitation_token: nil)

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
