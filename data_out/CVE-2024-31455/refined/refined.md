{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A recent refactoring introduced a SQL query to fetch GitHub repositories associated with a project, without specifying a provider. The query was missing parenthesis and would select a random repository instead of the intended one.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect SQL query logic leading to data leakage.",
    "Lack of proper input validation for provider when querying repositories."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user could potentially retrieve information about a random repository instead of the intended one, leading to data leakage.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through an API call that executes the faulty SQL query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A user with low privileges is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attack vector is network-based."
