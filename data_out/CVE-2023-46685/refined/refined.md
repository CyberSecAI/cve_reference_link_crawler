- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The telnet service on the LevelOne WBR-6013 router uses hard-coded credentials for the root user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded password vulnerability (CWE-259) in the telnet daemon. The device uses `/etc/passwd_orig` as `/etc/passwd`, which contains a hardcoded root password hash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the device through arbitrary command execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker connects to the telnet service, and uses the hardcoded password to log in as root.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network connectivity to the device's telnet service, typically on a LAN network. The attacker needs to know the hardcoded password for the root user.
