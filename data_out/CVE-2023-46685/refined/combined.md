# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1871

## LevelOne WBR-6013 telnetd hard-coded password vulnerability

##### July 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-46685

##### SUMMARY

A hard-coded password vulnerability exists in the telnetd functionality of LevelOne WBR-6013 RER4\_A\_v3411b\_2T2R\_LEV\_09\_170623. A set of specially crafted network packets can lead to arbitrary command execution.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

LevelOne WBR-6013 RER4\_A\_v3411b\_2T2R\_LEV\_09\_170623

##### PRODUCT URLS

WBR-6013 - <https://www.level1.com/level1_en/wbr-6013-n300-wireless-router-54069103>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-259 - Use of Hard-coded Password

##### DETAILS

The WBR-6013 is a SOHO wireless router produced by LevelOne.

The WBR-6013 has a telnetd service that listens for connections. In the WBR-6013’s documentation, telnetd is not mentioned and the credentials for login are not mentioned either.

The file `/etc/passwd_orig` is going to be used as `/etc/passwd` file. This file also contains the hash of the users’ passwords:

```
root:<redacted>:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh
nobody:x:0:0:nobody:/:/dev/null
admin:<redacted>:1000:1000:Linux User,,,:/home/admin:/bin/sh

```

The credentials for obtaining root in the WBR-6013 device, through telnet, are weak and hardcoded. An attacker could use these hard-coded credentials for obtaining complete control over the device.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

It is possible to connect to the telnetd service and obtain root by providing the hard-coded root’s password.

```
# telnet 192.168.100.1
Trying 192.168.100.1...
Connected to 192.168.100.1.
Escape character is '^]'.

rlx-linux login: root
Password:
