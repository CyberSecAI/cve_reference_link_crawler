On February 19, 2024, ConnectWise published a [security advisory](https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8) for ScreenConnect version 23.9.8, referencing two vulnerabilities and software weaknesses. The same day, Huntress researchers worked to understand this threat and successfully recreated a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating its impact.

This write-up will discuss our analysis efforts and the technical details behind this attack, which weâre coining as âSlashAndGrab.â

The ConnectWise advisory indicated that in all versions of ScreenConnect below 23.9.8 there were two vulnerabilities:

1. **CVE-2024-1709**: Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel (CWE-288)
2. **CVE-2024-1708**: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (âpath traversalâ)Â (CWE-22)

The first vulnerability was disclosed with a critical base CVSS scoring of 10, the highest possible severity. The authentication bypass would ultimately open the door for the second vulnerability.

ConnectWise made a patch available and expressed that all **on-premise** versions of ScreenConnect 23.9.7 and below must be updated immediatelyâcloud instances were already automatically patched.

At the time of release, the ConnectWise advisory was very sparse on technical details. There was not much information available as to what these vulnerabilities really consisted of, how they might be taken advantage of, or any other threat intelligence or indicators of compromise to hunt for.

Once we recreated the exploit and attack chain, we came to the same conclusion: there should not be public details about the vulnerability until there had been adequate time for the industry to patch. It would be too dangerous for this information to be readily available to threat actors.

But, with other vendors now publicly sharing the proof-of-concept exploit, the cat is out of the bag. We now feel that sharing our analysis shares no more threat than what is already available. So, weâre ready to spill the beans.

**The âexploitâ is trivial and embarrassingly easy.**

Below is a video demonstration of our recreated proof-of-concept exploit, which performs the simple authentication bypass but takes it a step further to showcase remote code execution.

## **Our Analysis**

When the Huntress team was made aware of the ConnectWise advisory, our team began to dig into what changes were made in the patch that could help explain what these vulnerabilities were.

We could simply look for the differences between code present in the new, patched version, and the previous, unpatched version. Creating a local testing environment for both of these states of the ScreenConnect software, we could easily see the delta that might clue us into the potential exploit.

We observed that these files differed:Â

## **CVE-2024-1709 - Authentication Bypass**

Most of these changes observed in the new version were binary files, which require decompilation to compare; however, [.highlight]**SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight] is a text file. When looking at the differences in this file, it immediately looked promising:

In the newest update, we can see there is a new check to ensure that the instance is set up before allowing the user to use the setup wizard. This piqued our interest as, at face value, version 23.9.7 already blocked access to the setup wizard after authentication. Looking closer into [.highlight]**ScreenConnect.SetupModule**[.highlight] inside of [.highlight]**ScreenConnect.Web.dll**[.highlight] sheds more light on the exploitation path.Â

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d558784370931755195cac_VOF-6GVi8aXEkUnXg6QMpJKg-y8tK8X8wOzr8vpiZr_zsnrQ1-UW6sUxmPiI-pnhlH9p0AaCEsGVqrqIPEEjzdtn1RgshZH8XoaYV118B5SJaZlF4D_KSNMJszRFzGhxjQnjBtSdwnhn786MYYrs8PI.png)

In previous versions of ScreenConnect, this handler was registered for the [.highlight]**OnBeginRequest**[.highlight] event, while in 28.9.8 it is registered for the [.highlight]**OnPostMapRequestHandler**[.highlight] event. This was seemingly done so that the [.highlight]**context.Handler**[.highlight] field will be populated. A new check is added to validate if the resolved HTTP handler implements the new [.highlight]**ISetupHandler**[.highlight] interface whereas the old code simply checked that [.highlight]**Request.Path**[.highlight] string matched â[.highlight]**/SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight]â. This change implies that there was some way to bypass the string comparison of [.highlight]**Request.Path**[.highlight] in previous versions. **If the request path does not match â[.highlight]/SetupWizard.aspx[.highlight],â then the setup wizard will be allowed regardless of the setup state of the instance.**

This would normally not be exploitable, but .Net has weird functionality that allows URL path components after a mapped legitimate URL to be passed along to the application. This information is exposed in [.highlight]**Request.FilePath**[.highlight], [.highlight]**Request.PathInfo**[.highlight] and [.highlight]**Request.Path**[.highlight]. For example, if there is a legitimate path â[.highlight]**/something.aspx**[.highlight]â, then .Net will allow the user to request â[.highlight]**/something.aspx/anythingelse**[.highlight]â and will pass along the trailing bit after the file path via the [.highlight]**Request.PathInfo**[.highlight]. However, [.highlight]**Request.Path**[.highlight] always contains *both*[.highlight]**Request.FilePath**[.highlight] *and* [.highlight]**Request.PathInfo**[.highlight] per [MSDN documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httprequest.path?view=netframework-4.8.1):

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d5587895aab08ada261523_5o-p55Z5UH6spdxDIaiuiwTL9pVNZXaiwYCUp_mSsxn5z2xDpK5Gw_o-o3ftPbQ7VWbSHYopNTqSimVy3lDSLfLGwHVzAfoGW9N1HJWh2dZFb5cpxoqI6tiihUgtb81vYtMTJUT6-f3byU3q8g8krbU.png)

Putting this together, it means we can simply request â[.highlight]**/SetupWizard.aspx/literallyanything**[.highlight]â and we should be allowed to access the setup wizard on already-configured ScreenConnect instances.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d55879cb2af12170f04f97_Es0JkQJKuG-5DjiEiOOfDGEQKAHS8dBwPDRCXqlN72QDQ733637nICPRUkYkJ6TA3JyCaZFTEw5a6dezq4jWGGXwyhFfOG4mpm40MNYMWR7rH-OXO8tepHjgTJbWCQUwRWt0TQ79MJbSTcioXS5mWkQ.png)

The setup wizard is responsible for setting up the initial administrative user and installing a license on the system during initial setup. The user creation portion of this setup happens immediately after clicking the âNextâ button on the setup page, so there is no need to complete the setup wizard fully to exploit the system (i.e. you do not need to replace or have access to a valid license key). **Completing this step will completely overwrite the internal user database. All other local users will be deleted aside from the user you specify in the setup wizard.**

Once you have administrative access to a compromised instance, it is trivial to create and upload a malicious ScreenConnect extension to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is not a vulnerability, but a feature of ScreenConnect, which allows an administrator to create extensions that execute .Net code as [.highlight]**SYSTEM**[.highlight] on the ScreenConnect server.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d5587816961aa1bccf46e7_bCQT10Rn49nJ0hfB4GAkkb3XEvxwdyo-gxNYZzVtE5K9v1nQmjWbCW6OHPdS9wTnTRGJ0KpH_LH0d1YY_Ignr_zFKfRs9BqM1SpJfeox48WDpKIdDgOhJ6d_n947AQK1p4PqR0fxL7-LawYoIVNYcys.png)
## **CVE-2024-1708 - Path Traversal**

The second vulnerability referenced in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect advisory presents a risk of ZipSlip attacks. We observed changes to [.highlight]**ScreenConnect.Core.dll**[.highlight]:

and [.highlight]**ScreenConnect.Server.dll**[.highlight]:Â

This adds new function arguments to strictly handle file paths when extracting content from a ZIP file. Looking through the code base, we can see these utility functions only seem to be used when handling ScreenConnect extensions. Prior to this patch, a malicious extension could potentially write files anywhere within [.highlight]**C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect\App\_Extensions**[.highlight] instead of being properly restricted to their extension subdirectory.

While this is another vulnerability fixed in version [.highlight]**23.9.8**[.highlight] that could lead to remote code execution in certain conditions, it relies upon having administrative credentials and access to be able to use the Extensions functionality. This capability is âunlockedâ by the authentication bypass, but is less severe on its own.

In our recreated proof-of-concept exploit, taking advantage of this potential ZipSlip attack vector was not necessary; after gaining administrator access with the authentication bypass, it was already possible to run arbitrary code with the typical Extensions feature set. The primary difference being that malicious code written using this vulnerability does not necessarily need an installed extension to execute. This means that it may go unnoticed more easily within your environment. Any [.highlight]**.aspx**[.highlight] or [.highlight]**.ashx**[.highlight] files within the root of [.highlight]**C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect\App\_Extensions\**[.highlight] are likely malicious artifacts. ScreenConnect does not place any files within this directory normally.

## **Detection Guidance**

While researching the above vulnerabilities, Huntress identified Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs) and developed a set of detections that can be used to notify ScreenConnect users of potential malicious activity.

As a reminder, per Huntressâs previous [post](https://www.huntress.com/blog/detection-guidance-for-connectwise-cwe-288-2), the below listed SIGMA rules that leverage [Windows Event ID 4663](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4663) requires that the Advanced Auditing policy be configured, and an appropriate SACL applied to the directory. Please refer to the previous blog post for how to generate this event.Â Â

## **CVE-2024-1709 - Authentication Bypass**

While replicating the Authentication Bypass exploit, Huntress observed IIS logs for the malicious [.highlight]**SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight] URL path, which can be used as an indicator of compromise:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d55878e0bce79d5469d328_3UiSOzyngYMkZ2TqaT488ZZgGjEPTdpHFOHkPvUScU7z6Jt6uD9hGkaoWVJ8fI1IIO0FNuU_UaNbwPZ6Um9h1WGtQhkSWMxcosQz0KFHj3JgrbVAQ7sIzu8kQ-DuLMcQIS-Cj1aTMKfDCygOuW_R_rk.png)

The following Sigma rule will detect requests made to [.highlight]**SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight] with a trailing path segment. This behavior is never legitimate, and should clearly indicate malicious intent if observed in the wild.

After accessing the Setup Wizard, an attacker will input new credentials to gain access to Screen Connect. Doing so will write a new user database to a temporary XML file. The following Sigma rule can be used to detect the ScreenConnect server writing to a temporary XML file on the server. While this may be an indicator of compromise, this activity is known to also be observed when legitimately modifying local users or their permissions in ScreenConnect, so there is a non-zero false positive rate.

The following YARA rule is similar to the IIS log Sigma rule given above. It will detect IIS log entries that reference [.highlight]**SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight] with a trailing path component. As mentioned previously, a trailing path component on this file is always associated with malicious activity.

## **CVE-2024-1708 - Path Traversal**

The path traversal exploit allows attackers to write files within the root of the [.highlight]**App\_Extensions**[.highlight] directory. The following Sigma rule should alert on file modifications at the root of the [.highlight]**App\_Extensions**[.highlight] directory while excluding legitimate modifications to extensions themselves.Â

**February 23, 2024 update:**

ICYMI: ConnectWise has taken an exception step to support partners no longer under maintenance by making them eligible to install [version 22.4](https://screenconnect.product.connectwise.com/communities/26/topics/3980-connectwise-control-224) at no additional cost, which will fix CVE-2024-1709, the critical vulnerability. However, this should be treated as an interim step. ConnectWise recommends on-premise partners upgrade to remain within maintenance  to gain access to all security and product enhancements.

**February 22, 2024 update:**

ConnectWise has rolled out an additional mitigation step for unpatched, on-premise users that suspends an instance if it is not on version 23.9.8 or later. If your instance is found to be on an outdated version, an alert will be sent with instructions on how to perform the necessary actions to release the server.

**On-prem partner summary**: On-prem partners are advised to immediately upgrade to the latest version of ScreenConnect to remediate against reported vulnerabilities.

Today, ScreenConnect version 23.9.10.8817 was released containing a number of fixes to improve customer experience. It is always recommended to be on the latest version but 23.9.8 is the minimum version that remediated the reported vulnerabilities.

As part of this release, ConnectWise has removed license restrictions, so partners no longer under maintenance can upgrade to the latest version of ScreenConnect.

*\*Please see the February 27, 2024 security bulletin update that clarifies partners off maintenance can upgrade to 22.4.20001 (or a later eligible version) to receive a patch to CVE-2024-1709. To get the current 23.9.8 or later release, partners need to be on active maintenance.*

**February 20, 2024 update:**

**Indicators of compromise**Indicators of compromise (IOCs) look for malicious activity or threats. These indicators can be incorporated into your cybersecurity monitoring platform. They can help you stop a cyberattack that's in progress. Plus, you can use IOCs to find ways to detect and stop ransomware, malware, and other cyberthreats before they cause data breaches.

We've received notifications of suspicious activity that our incident response team has investigated. The following IP addresses were used by threat actors. We are making them available for protection and defense.

* 155.133.5.15
* 155.133.5.14
* 118.69.65.60

We will continue to update with any further information as it becomes available.

**Original Bulletin:**

**Summary**

Vulnerabilities were reported February 13, 2024, through our vulnerability disclosure channel via the ConnectWise Trust Center.

## FAQs

Frequently asked questions

What happened?

On February 13, 2024, an independent researcher ethically and responsibly reported two potential vulnerabilities using the ConnectWise vulnerability disclosure program through the ConnectWise Trust Center, including a potential critical vulnerability that would allow anonymous attackers to exploit an authentication bypass flaw to create admin accounts on publicly exposed instances. Essentially, a bad actor could mimic the role as system admin, delete all other users and take over the instance.

What did ConnectWise do?

Once the vulnerability was validated on February 14, 2024, ConnectWise product security and engineering teams worked together to mitigate all cloud instances of ScreenConnect within 48 hours. We did so without requiring a version update. Then, we upgraded cloud instances to a later version for further hardening. As a result, partners within our hosted cloud environments were quickly secured against this critical vulnerability.

Following industry best practices for patching strategy, an official upgraded package was released on February 19, 2024, for all on-prem ScreenConnect partners, and a security bulletin was posted to the ConnectWise Trust Center strongly urging partners patch their on-prem instances of ScreenConnect. On the same day, ConnectWise initiated contact with CISA, and on February 22, CISA added CVE-2024-1709 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog.

In addition, to provide timely information and support to our partners, we mobilized outreach communications through multiple channels, including security bulletins and advisories, partner emails, virtual events, and blogs. These communications emphasize the urgency to patch on-prem instances of ScreenConnect while providing our partners with the latest information, best practices, and support for this critical vulnerability.

![](/globalassets/media/blog/2024/02/screenconnect-response-timeline_4.png)

Who is at risk?

Anyone on a self-hosted instance running ScreenConnect 23.9.7 and prior.

Partners no longer under maintenance are eligible to install version 22.4.20001 at no additional cost, which will fix both vulnerabilities. However, this should be treated as an interim step. ConnectWise recommends updating to the latest release to get all the current security patches and therefore all partners should upgrade to 23.9.8 or higher as outlined in the upgrade path below.

**Upgrade ScreenConnect to a patched version**

1. To upgrade to version 23.9.8 or later, please note there is a specific upgrade path that must be followed:

1 → 2.5 → 3.1 → 4.4 → 5.4 → 19.2 → 22.8 → 23.3 → 23.9.8+

2. If you are not on maintenance and upgrading to 22.4.20001 (or your latest eligible version), please follow this specified upgrade path:

2.1 → 2.5 → 3.1 → 4.4 → 5.4 → 19.2 → 22.4.20001

**As a reminder and as part of the remediation process for on-prem partners—whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact while upgrading and before bringing any systems back online.**

To assist in the remediation and hardening process, we encourage you to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) for additional protection.

What is the current status of the vulnerability?

**Cloud partners**
Cloud partners are remediated against both vulnerabilities reported on February 19 (CVE-2024-1709, CVE-2024-1708). No further action is required from any cloud partner (“screenconnect.com” cloud and “hostedrmm.com”), but we recommend to **trust but verify**. Take this opportunity as a reason to review your configuration, user accounts, and access logs to verify that everything aligns with what you would expect.

**On-premise partners**
A patch is available to you if you are a self-hosted or on-premise partner; we urge you to update your servers to version 23.9.8 immediately to apply the patch.

For instruction on updating to the newest release, please reference this doc: [Upgrade an on-premise installation - ConnectWise](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/Get_started_with_ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_On-Premise/Upgrade_an_on-premises_installation)

**As a reminder and as part of the remediation process for on-prem partners—whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact while upgrading and before bringing any systems back online.**

If you possess enhanced Windows event logs or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, thorough investigation should be conducted to identify any suspicious activity, including evidence of commands run from webshells or other indicators of compromise.

In the event of file anomalies or other indicators of compromise are identified, it is highly recommended to seek assistance from external response companies specializing in incident response and digital forensics. These companies possess the expertise necessary to effectively investigate and remediate security concerns.

Review file system, enhanced Windows event logs or EDR solutions for suspicious activity, such as webshell commands or other compromise indicators.

Seek assistance from specialized incident response and forensics firms if potential impacted files are identified.

To assist in the remediation and hardening process, we encourage you to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) for additional protection.

How can partners protect themselves?

There are many things that a partner can do to protect themselves. In this situation, the most important thing you can do is **patch your instances immediately!**

**As a reminder and as part of the remediation process for on-prem partners—whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact while upgrading and before bringing any systems back online.**

What's the state of hosted/cloud partners?

ConnectWise cloud operations and engineering teams worked together to mitigate all ConnectWise hosted cloud instances of ScreenConnect within 48 hours of validation of the critical vulnerability. ConnectWise was able to mitigate the issue for partners in ConnectWise hosted environments without requiring a version update, because of the nature of the critical vulnerability. We next focused on creating a new build that patched both reported vulnerabilities and deployed it to partners in all cloud hosted environments (version 23.9.8). Cloud partners were not required to update agents to remediate the vulnerabilities. Partners on version 23.9.8 or higher are considered patched.

For cloud partners, do we need to make sure that all devices have been patched?

ScreenConnect clients (agents) are not directly impacted by this issue. This is because the identified vulnerabilities involve an authentication bypass and path traversal issues within the server software itself (unpatched ScreenConnect instances version 23.9.7 and below), rather than any vulnerabilities within the client software that is installed on end-user devices. As a best practice, partners should update their agents after a server upgrade, but it is not required to mitigate this vulnerability. Check the ConnectWise University for more information on [reinstalling and upgrading an access agent](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/Get_started/Host_page/Reinstall_and_upgrade_an_access_agent).

Why was cloud patched first? Why was there a gap between patching the cloud and notifying on-prem partners?

Once the vulnerability was validated on February 14, 2024, ConnectWise cloud operations and engineering teams worked together to mitigate all ConnectWise hosted cloud instances of ScreenConnect. Due to the nature of the critical vulnerability, ConnectWise was able to mitigate the issue for partners in ConnectWise hosted environments quickly without requiring a version update. In tandem, we focused on creating new builds that patched both reported vulnerabilities for the current stable release and for versions dating back to 2022. The goal was to provide an upgrade path to a patched release to as many on-prem partners as possible. It took more time to update and QA multiple older builds for on-prem, whereas our cloud environments managed by ConnectWise were standardized to a smaller list of more current releases.

Version 23.9.10 was released, do I need to be on that version?

ScreenConnect version 23.9.10 is just the next release of ScreenConnect. The vulnerabilities were patched in versions 23.9.8 or higher. Partners on 23.9.8 or higher are considered patched for CVE-2024-1708 and CVE-2024-1709. New releases in the cloud will be returning to our normal rolling schedule moving forward.

What can I do if I suspect I have been compromised?

If you suspect your ScreenConnect software may be compromised, prioritize securing your systems. Follow your existing incident response playbook to isolate the affected servers and create backups to analyze later. Don't put those servers back online until they're thoroughly investigated, rebuilt, and secured with the latest patches.

Remember, a compromised ScreenConnect server might not be the only point of entry. Your incident response should encompass your entire system to identify and address any broader security vulnerabilities. We encourage you to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) .

I’m considering migrating/have migrated my on-prem server to ScreenConnect cloud since the security bulletin. What should I consider as part of a cloud migration?

Whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact before bringing any systems back online, upgrading your server, or migrating your server.  We encourage partners to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) for additional protection.

Review the guide thoroughly and pay particular attention to the Internal Users on your on-prem server to verify that there are no unknown internal user accounts. Review file system, enhanced Windows event logs or EDR solutions for suspicious activity, such as web shell commands or other compromise indicators. Please seek assistance from specialized incident response and forensics firms if potential impacted files are identified.

Partners can then follow our instructions to migrate to the cloud: [Migrate to ScreenConnect Cloud from a Windows server - ConnectWise](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/Get_started/Migrate_to_ScreenConnect_Cloud_from_a_Windows_server). Post migration, partners should verify agent counts, uninstall agents, and decommission the on-premises server.  This should include removing DNS records and firewall rules allotted to the on premises ScreenConnect server.

Some of the partners are getting a license revoked error, even after upgrading their server to the latest version and rebooting. What do we do next?

Licenses were paused for servers that have checked in using an unpatched version. You will be able to upgrade to the current/patched versions, and if the license is eligible for the installed version, it will automatically be restored by the license server. However, the key would still need to be valid for the version you're using. If the key is not valid, it will stay as revoked, and you'd need to upgrade the key. To update upgrade your on-prem license, [click here](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/On-premises_licensing/Upgrade_an_on-premises_license).

Do my agents need to be upgraded? Were my agents affected by the vulnerability? Some security tools are flagging ScreenConnect agents as malware.

ScreenConnect clients (agents) are not directly impacted by this issue. This is because the identified vulnerabilities involve an authentication bypass and path traversal issues within the server software itself (unpatched ScreenConnect instances version 23.9.7 and below), rather than any vulnerabilities within the client software that is installed on end-user devices. Partners have notified us that certain A/V vendors have flagged agents. These reports should be registered as false positives to your vendors, but we're also working with select vendors to fix the issue.

Why didn’t I receive an email?  Who at my company did receive an email?

We went to great lengths to contact partners and previous partners regarding this issue through multiple channels (e.g., email, Trust Center with RSS feed, blog, media/news outlets, channel advocates, social media, webinars, phone calls, community forums).

Why was my cloud-hosted ScreenConnect showing a version older than 23.9.8 when the security advisory said we had already been updated?

We apologize for any confusion. For cloud-hosted partners, including RMM/Command partners, while we communicated that there was no action needed, many believed they were still vulnerable because their ScreenConnect was showing a version older than 23.9.8. We took action to remediate the vulnerability for all cloud partners, but because partners did not have the new version installed, they thought they were still vulnerable. We rolled out full version upgrades to resolve this. Again, we apologize for any confusion and inconvenience, or original message may have caused.

Why did my cloud-hosted ScreenConnect instance have downtime on February 21?

Some of our cloud-hosted partners (including RMM/Command partners) were concerned they were possibly compromised due to a brief downtime on February 21. This was due to an accelerated rollout of the formal patch version (23.9) to put us back on a proper release schedule. The average downtime for this was around 10 minutes.

How do I know what version of ScreenConnect I am eligible for?

Check your Status/Overview page and review the Version Check. Review the Latest Eligible Version row; this will detail the latest version of ScreenConnect that your license permits you to upgrade to.

Partners no longer under maintenance are eligible to install version 22.4.20001 at no additional cost, which will fix CVE-2024-1709, the critical vulnerability. However, this should be treated as an interim step. ConnectWise recommends updating to the latest release to get all the current security patches and therefore all partners should upgrade to 23.9.8 or higher using the upgrade path outlined above.

For instructions on how to renew your license, please [click here](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/On-premises_licensing/Upgrade_an_on-premises_license) or contact our sales team at screenconnectsales@connectwise.com.

What happens once I have patched to a remediated version?

**As a reminder and as part of the remediation process for on-prem partners—whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact while upgrading and before bringing any systems back online.**

Once you have patched your on-prem instance of ScreenConnect to the latest version, you should review users with access to ScreenConnect, remove any that are not recognized, change passwords, and enable MFA.

If you are using any extensions, please validate them and remove/add them again. Once all steps are completed restart the server.

To assist in the remediation and hardening process, we encourage you to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) for additional protection.

Do these vulnerabilities directly affect ScreenConnect clients?

ScreenConnect clients (agents) are not directly impacted by this issue. This is because the identified vulnerabilities involve an authentication bypass and path traversal issues within the server software itself (unpatched ScreenConnect instances version 23.9.7 and below), rather than any vulnerabilities within the client software that is installed on end-user devices. As a best practice, partners should update their agents after a server upgrade, but it is not required to mitigate the vulnerability. Check the ConnectWise University for more information on [reinstalling and upgrading an access agent](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/Get_started/Host_page/Reinstall_and_upgrade_an_access_agent).

Is there any connection between the ConnectWise ScreenConnect vulnerability disclosed on February 19, 2024, and the incident at Change Healthcare?

We are unaware of any confirmed connection between the ConnectWise ScreenConnect vulnerability disclosed on February 19, 2024, and the incident at Change Healthcare.

Our internal reviews have yet to identify Change Healthcare as a ScreenConnect customer, and none of our extensive network of MSPs have come forward with any information regarding their association with Change Healthcare.

What is ConnectWise doing to prevent vulnerabilities or exploits from happening again?

We maintain a robust "shift left" security program with continuous and ongoing investments, such as embedded security champions, threat modeling, code review, automated scanning and fuzzing, and both internal and external dedicated application penetration testing. However, even with all those best practices in place, vulnerabilities can still be discovered. This is true for the software industry, as exemplified by industry events like Patch Tuesday (also known as Update Tuesday), which has been around for over 20 years.

An additional focus is on continuously improving our vulnerability identification and response processes. A key component of this effort is our vulnerability disclosure program found on our [Trust Center](/company/trust). This program highlights our commitment to collaborating with independent researchers, industry organizations, partners, and the greater community across the globe in identifying weaknesses in any technology and helps ensure that reported vulnerabilities are handled ethically and responsibly, playing a crucial role in prioritization for remediation.

The recent vulnerabilities were reported through our vulnerability disclosure program and demonstrates the effectiveness of this program. We continue to focus on preventing vulnerabilities and how we respond, react, and keep you informed when they do occur.

To ensure you receive the latest security-related communications from ConnectWise, we highly recommend subscribing to the RSS feeds from our Trust Center to ensure you receive real-time notifications on the latest [security advisories](/company/trust/advisories) and [bulletins](/company/trust/security-bulletins).
