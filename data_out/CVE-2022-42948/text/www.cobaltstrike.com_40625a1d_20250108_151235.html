# Out Of Band Update: Cobalt Strike 4.7.2

Tuesday 17 October, 2023

Cobalt Strike 4.7.2 is now available. This is an out of band update to fix a remote code execution vulnerability that is rooted in Java Swing but which can be exploited in Cobalt Strike.

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

I’d like to start by giving credit to Rio Sherri ([0x09AL](https://twitter.com/0x09AL)) and Ruben Boonen ([FuzzySec](https://twitter.com/FuzzySec)) from the X-Force Red Adversary Simulation Team for their work in not only researching this vulnerability, but also sharing their findings with me and my team and helping us to mitigate it. They plan on publishing detailed information about this on [their blog](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/analysis-rce-vulnerability-cobalt-strike) later today (if their blog post isn’t live right now, check back later).

The write-up linked above goes into a tremendous amount of detail and is well worth taking the time to read. The very short version is that the underlying cause of this issue is due to Cobalt Strike’s user interface being built using the Java Swing framework. Certain components within Java Swing will automatically interpret any text as HTML content if it starts with <html>. This can be exploited using an object tag, which in turn can load a malicious payload from a webserver, which is then executed by the Cobalt Strike client. Disabling automatic parsing of html tags across the entire client was enough to mitigate this behaviour.

### Why Is There No CVE For This Vulnerability?

While the remote code execution vulnerability could be exploited in Cobalt Strike, I feel that it is important to stress that this isn’t specific to Cobalt Strike and this is the reason why we haven’t submitted a new CVE to cover it. The underlying vulnerability can be found in Java Swing and can be exploited in any Java Swing GUI that renders html, not just Cobalt Strike. We felt that there were parallels between this and the recent log4j vulnerability – thousands of applications that used log4j were vulnerable and yet there aren’t CVEs to cover every single vulnerable application. It is the same case here, although I appreciate that some people may disagree.

It goes without saying that as this is our second out of band update in a matter of weeks, we apologise for any problems that these issues may have caused.
