{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the Java Swing framework interpreting text as HTML content if it starts with `<html>`. This allows an attacker to use an `<object>` tag to load a malicious payload from a remote server which is then executed by the Cobalt Strike client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of user-controlled input within Java Swing components",
       "Insecure parsing of HTML within a Java application"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the system running the Cobalt Strike client.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based exploitation by crafting malicious HTML content and injecting it through user-input fields",
      "By injecting malicious HTML within a file explorer or note field in the post-exploitation platform UI of Cobalt Strike.",
        "By loading a malicious payload from a remote server using the `<object>` tag."

    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability."
