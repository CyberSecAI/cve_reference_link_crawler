Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2024-28560 and CVE-2024-28559, as described in the provided text:

**CVE-2024-28560**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when using `DB::raw()` in the `deleteArea()` function within `/app/model/system/Address.php`. Specifically, the `$id` and `$level` parameters, which are user-controlled, are directly incorporated into the raw SQL query without validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to or modification of database information.
*   **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP request to the `deleteArea` function in `/app/shop/controller/Address.php` with a malicious `$id` and `$level` values. The attacker can manipulate the SQL query that is executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application, and from the code provided, it looks like a user with "shop" level access is enough.

**CVE-2024-28559**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of input validation within the `setPrice()` function in `/app/model/goods/Batch.php` when constructing the SQL query using `DB::raw()`. The `$calculate_str` variable is formed by concatenating several unsanitized input parameters (`$calculate_price_field`, `$sign_str`, `$price`).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
*   **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP request to the `setPrice()` function in `/app/shop/controller/Goodsbatchset.php` with a malicious `price` value. The attacker can manipulate the SQL query that is executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application, and from the code provided, it looks like a user with "shop" level access is enough.

**Additional details from the provided text:**

*   The vulnerabilities exist in Niushop versions 5.3.3 and below.
*   The author used a whitebox approach (source code audit) to identify the vulnerabilities.
*   The author has provided sample SQL injection payloads using tools such as SQLMap and manual tests, demonstrating the feasibility of exploitation for both CVEs.
*   Both CVEs are rated as medium severity (CVSS score 6.3).
*   The author notes the large amount of Niushop deployments primarily located in China, Hong Kong and Thailand.
