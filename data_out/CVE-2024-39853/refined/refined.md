The provided content describes a vulnerability, but it is for **CVE-2024-38997**, not CVE-2024-39853. The content describes a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `@adolph_dudu/ratio-swiper` package.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `extendDefaults` and `parse` functions in the `@adolph_dudu/ratio-swiper` package are vulnerable to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way `extendDefaults` and `parse` handle input. They do not properly sanitize or validate the input and thus allow an attacker to inject `__proto__` property into the object which causes a modification to the `Object.prototype`

**Impact of exploitation:**
By exploiting this, an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype`, which can lead to various impacts, including:
- Denial of service
- Remote code execution
- Cross-site scripting attacks, depending on the context of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this by calling the vulnerable functions `extendDefaults` or `parse` with an argument containing a `__proto__` property.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable functions with crafted input. This typically involves being able to control the arguments passed to these functions within the application's logic.
