- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The system allows a privileged user to upload generic files to the root installation directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the file path during file upload, allowing a privileged user to specify the destination directory and overwrite existing files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could replace specific files, potentially leading to tampering of system functionalities or remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. A privileged user with network access to the affected system can upload malicious files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a privileged user account on the affected system to exploit this vulnerability.
