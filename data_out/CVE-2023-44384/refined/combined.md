SECURITY: use `FinalDestination` to prevent SSRF attacks on API calls. (

[#50](https://github.com/discourse/discourse-jira/pull/50))

Also, it will check the issue key value on the "attach" action and won't allow the `/` character in it.

Previously, an administrator could point the Jira server to an arbitrary location. After entering an issue key or an arbitrary path in the “Attach Issue” feature, the request failed, however, the output of the response was reflected in the error logs. This vulnerability could be used to enumerate ports on the remote host locally, as well as retrieve responses from non-public-facing services, such as the Prometheus Ruby Exporter. While the path to the issue lookup was automatically appended by the application, it was possible to use the “…/” notation to manipulate the path from the interface. Therefore, any user with the ability to add an existing issue to a POST could perform arbitrary GET requests against the Jira API, however, only the administrator could see the output in the error logs.

Moderate

[pmusaraj](/pmusaraj)
published
GHSA-pmv5-h2x6-35fh
Oct 4, 2023

## Package

discourse-jira
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

<= f11be4c

## Patched versions

> f11be4c

## Description

### Impact

1. An administrator user can make an SSRF attack by setting the Jira URL to an arbitrary location and enabling the `discourse_jira_verbose_log` site setting.
2. A moderator could manipulate the request path to the Jira API, allowing them to perform arbitrary GET requests using the Jira API credentials, potentially with elevated permissions.

### Patches

The issue is patched in the latest version of the plugin.

### Workarounds

Disable or uninstall the plugin temporarily.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Also, it will check the issue key value on the "attach" action and won't allow the `/` character in it.

Previously, an administrator could point the Jira server to an arbitrary location. After entering an issue key or an arbitrary path in the “Attach Issue” feature, the request failed, however, the output of the response was reflected in the error logs. This vulnerability could be used to enumerate ports on the remote host locally, as well as retrieve responses from non-public-facing services, such as the Prometheus Ruby Exporter. While the path to the issue lookup was automatically appended by the application, it was possible to use the “…/” notation to manipulate the path from the interface. Therefore, any user with the ability to add an existing issue to a POST could perform arbitrary GET requests against the Jira API, however, only the administrator could see the output in the error logs.

Sorry, something went wrong.
