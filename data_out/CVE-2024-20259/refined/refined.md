- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A crafted IPv4 DHCP request packet is mishandled when endpoint analytics are enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of a crafted IPv4 DHCP request packet. This is due to the interaction between DHCP snooping and endpoint analytics features. The vulnerability is identified as CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted DHCP request through an affected device. The attack vector is listed as "network" because a DHCP relay anywhere on the network could allow exploits from networks other than the adjacent one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an affected Cisco device where DHCP snooping and endpoint analytics are enabled. No authentication is required.
