The Analytify â€“ Google Analytics Dashboard For WordPress (GA4 analytics made easy) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wpa_check_authentication' function in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the site's Google Analytics tracking ID.
