- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing capability check on the 'wpa_check_authentication' function in the Analytify plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Access Control, specifically a missing authorization check.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can modify the site's Google Analytics tracking ID. This could allow attackers to track website traffic, potentially injecting their own tracking code for malicious purposes, or manipulate the data collected by the legitimate site owner.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no prior authentication or special permissions and can be remote.
