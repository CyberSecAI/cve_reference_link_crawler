- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the firewall's susceptibility to denial-of-service (DoS) when flooded with specific, crafted network traffic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the firewall's inability to properly handle a specific type of forged traffic, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, making the firewall unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker floods the firewall with malicious traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any specific privileges or user interaction. The attack can be initiated remotely via the network.
