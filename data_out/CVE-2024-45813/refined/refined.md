Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a poorly constructed regular expression generated when handling routes with multiple parameters within a single segment, especially when a hyphen `-` is placed at the end of the segment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The generated regex, specifically for routes like `/:a-:b-`, exhibits catastrophic backtracking when matched against crafted long inputs, causing excessive CPU consumption and potentially leading to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted URLs with long strings of hyphens, an attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive due to the high CPU load from regex backtracking.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can send malicious HTTP requests containing specially crafted URLs to the vulnerable server over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No special privileges or user interaction:** The attack can be executed without requiring user interaction or any prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `find-my-way` prior to `8.2.2` and `9.0.1`.
- The vulnerable regex pattern is generated when there are two or more parameters within a single path segment, such as `/flights/:from-:to`.
- The regex generated is similar to `/^\/flights\/([^\/]+?)-([^\/]+?)\/?$/i`. When a long string of hyphens (e.g., `'-'.repeat(16_000)`) followed by a character is input, the regex engine backtracks excessively trying to find a match.
- The fix involves preventing backtracking using `((?!\-|\/).)+?` for the second parameter, or removing regex features altogether.
- The issue was also present in `path-to-regexp` which is a dependency for other projects like Express.js and Next.js.
