Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Watcher search input in Elasticsearch was logging search query results at the DEBUG log level. This caused the raw contents of documents stored in Elasticsearch to be printed in the logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Excessive logging of sensitive data (search query results) in DEBUG logs.
- Unintended exposure of document content through logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality breach: Sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch can be exposed by analyzing the DEBUG logs.
- Unauthorized access to document content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the Elasticsearch logs can read the logged search query results, thereby gaining access to sensitive document contents.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is exposed if the Watcher feature is used, and logging for the `search input` is set to DEBUG level or a finer setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to the Elasticsearch logs.
- The attacker also needs to know that the Watcher feature with the search input is being used and the logging level is set to DEBUG or a more verbose level.
-  According to the CVSS vector, the attacker needs to have low privileges (`PR:L`), be adjacent to the target (`AV:A`), and user interaction is required (`UI:R`).

**Affected Versions:**
- Elasticsearch versions 7.0.0 up to 7.17.15
- Elasticsearch versions 8.0.0 up to 8.11.1

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.17.16 or 8.11.2
- If an upgrade is not feasible, change the logging level for Watcher search input to INFO or higher.
