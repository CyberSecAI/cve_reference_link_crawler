Moderate

[JCWasmx86](/JCWasmx86)
published
GHSA-48c5-35fh-846h
Apr 3, 2024

## Package

mesonlsp

## Affected versions

Every version until 4.1.3

## Patched versions

4.1.4

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows overwriting arbitrary files if the attacker can make the victim either run the language server within a specific crafted project or `mesonlsp --full`.

### Patches

It will be patched in 4.1.4

### Workarounds

Not running `mesonlsp --full` and setting the language server option `others.neverDownloadAutomatically` to `true`.

### Severity

Moderate

5.8

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L
