Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3384:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content directly discusses CVE-2022-3384 and provides details about the vulnerability. The github content mentions "CVE-2022-3383 && CVE-2022-3384" and then provides specifics for each CVE, and the wordfence content confirms it as a vulnerability related to the "Ultimate Member" plugin.

**2. Root Cause:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the use of `call_user_func()` in the `populate_dropdown_options()` function within the `class-admin-builder.php` file of the Ultimate Member plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Unfiltered Input:** The `populate_dropdown_options()` function takes a parameter that is directly passed to `call_user_func()` without proper sanitization.
   - **Use of `call_user_func()`:** The use of this function with unfiltered input allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary PHP functions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Limited Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The attacker can execute non-parameter PHP functions, such as `phpinfo()`. The exploit does not allow arbitrary code execution because the attacker does not control the second parameter of the `call_user_func()`.
   - The attacker can inject the vulnerable code that can be displayed on user's profiles.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector involves manipulating the `custom_dropdown_options_source` parameter, which is used as a callback function in `populate_dropdown_options()`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User (Admin+):** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges to access the vulnerable settings and inject the malicious function name.

**Additional Details (from Content):**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by adding a select/multiselect field and manipulating the `custom_dropdown_options_source`.
*   The attacker can set the `custom_dropdown_options_source` parameter to execute arbitrary php functions that don't require arguments, e.g. `phpinfo()`.
*   The vulnerability exists because the plugin doesn't validate user supplied input.
*   The vulnerability is also present when using `get_option_value_from_callback()` without the  `_parent_dropdown_relationship` parameter.

*   The fix in version 2.5.1 added a blacklist that contains all PHP internal functions.
