The provided content is related to CVE-2024-2189.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Social Icons Widget & Block plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape widget settings, which leads to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient sanitization and escaping of widget settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable widget. This can be leveraged to perform malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious code through widget settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access the widget settings and inject the malicious code.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how to inject malicious JavaScript using the `color_picker_fields` and `aria_label_fields` within the widget settings.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin prior to 4.2.18.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 and is present in the OWASP top 10 A7 category for Cross-Site Scripting.
