      "The specific nature of the vulnerability within the Outside In filters is not detailed."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, depending on how the software that uses Outside In Technology is implemented. The risk of exploitation also depends on whether the data processed by Outside In filters is obtained directly from network communications. The CVSS score assumes a direct network data feed but could be lower if this is not the case.",
