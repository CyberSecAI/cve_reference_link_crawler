## Details of vulnerability

Web Based Management is embedded in the above models, and it is possible to operate the devices or change configuration of the devices via web browser.

1. Improper Authentication

   By using the cookie-theft attack, an attacker may be able to access to Web Based Management function illegally, and view or change settings and information stored in the device.
2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces a user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. With the Web Based Management function, an attacker exploiting the vulnerability may be able to view or change settings and information stored in the device.

## Countermeasure

Please update the firmware to the fixed version. There are links to the download page in the above “Affected models and the versions of fixed firmware” table.

Please perform operation designated in “Operation Type” column for the model. The operation for Operation Type (A, B, C, and D) is shown below.

## Operation type A or B

1. Update the firmware with using Firmware update tool.
2. Wait for the device restarting and become ready.

## Operation type C

1. Update the firmware with using Firmware update tool.
2. Wait for the device restarting and become ready
3. Enter the menu mode.
4. Operate as following: Menu > 6. Network > 4. Web Based Management > OFF\*

* \*
  The numbers on each item may be different for each model

  If you want to turn this function ON again, please select “ON” in the operation #4 above.

## Operation type D

In this device, Web Based Management function can be switched alternatively. Please set this function to OFF in this operation.

1. Update the firmware with using Firmware update tool.
2. Wait for the device restarting and become ready.
3. Close the top cover and pull the power plug off.
4. With top cover closed, keep pressing the power button and put the power plug in. Confirm that all the LEDs turn on.
5. While keeping the power button pressed, open the top cover, and close it again. Confirm that the Error LED turns off.
6. Release the power button and confirm that all the LEDs turns off.
7. Press the power button five times and confirm that the power LED turns on when you push the power button.
8. Wait for one minute.
9. Print the Print Settings Page and confirm the Web Based Management item on Network Configuration is “Disabled.”
10. If it is “Enabled,” then go back to operation #3 on this list.

## Workarounds

We would like the customers to perform the below workarounds until the firmware is updated to the fixed version. It is possible to reduce the risk of attack.

* Please use your multi-function or single-function printers within the network protected by firewall etc.
* If access from the Internet is permitted, please consider allowing the access to restricted IP addresses only or use VPN to connect.
