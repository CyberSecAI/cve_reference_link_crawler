# WAPPLES

###### Intelligent Web Application and API Protection

[WAPPLES Data Sheet](https://pentasecuritysystems.activehosted.com/f/71)

WAPPLES is a Web Application and API Protection solution(WAAP) that utilizes logical analysis to protect web applications, APIs, and mobile apps from cyber attacks.

As a market share leader in Asia-Pacific, WAPPLES is an effective solution against sensitive data exposure, website defacement, API schema protection, malicious bots, and DoS, helping organizations exceed regulatory compliance.

Powered by a logical COCEP™ engine, WAPPLES reponds newest threats, including attacks in Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) launched by malicious groups to thieve data assets of governmental organizations or enterprises. The Lower false-positive rate, based on the intelligent logical COCEP™ detection engine, of Penta Security’s WAAP solutions including Cloud based one is recognized by Gartner in 2023 market guide.

![wapples new 2018 hardware](data:image/gif;base64...)![wapples new 2018 hardware](https://www.pentasecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wapples-2018.png)

#### Intelligence Allows Top Performance

**While traditional WAFs depend on high-maintenance signature updates for low-accuracy pattern-matching, WAPPLES uses a logic-based detection engine called COCEP™ (Contents Classification and Evaluation Processing).**

Utilizing 39 pre-configured detection rules, modified and even unknown attacks are categorized and blocked heuristically and semantically. This proprietary technology allows WAPPLES to deliver superior security with industry-leading accuracy and low false positive rates under various network environments.

![WAF comparison](data:image/gif;base64...)![WAF comparison](https://www.pentasecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WAF_5-1-e1547445748918.png)

Through the analysis of an attack’s characteristics, WAPPLES is able to identify attacks that utilize new patterns of exploit that often bypass typical WAFs utilizing signature-based detection engines.

[1st and 2nd generation WAFs](https://www.pentasecurity.com/product/waf/web-application-firewall/) that operate on blacklists and whitelists lag behind due to their reliance on signature updates to detect the latest threats. In comparison, the sophistication of security that WAPPLES can provide greatly surpasses that of signature-based WAFs.
