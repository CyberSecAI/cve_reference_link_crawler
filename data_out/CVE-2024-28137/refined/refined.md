- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition exists in an init script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: TOCTOU race condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with low privileges can perform a privilege escalation with an init script and gain root privileges, which allows them to take over the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Low-privileged local access to the device is required.
