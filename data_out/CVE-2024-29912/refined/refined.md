- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The iCalendrier WordPress plugin versions 1.80 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization/validation that allows a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts that can perform actions on behalf of a user visiting the website, including redirection, displaying advertisements, and other malicious HTML payloads.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the injection of malicious scripts into the website. The specific injection point is not detailed, but is likely to be related to user input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious script into the plugin, and a victim needs to visit a page containing the injected script. The vulnerability requires a user with at least contributor-level privileges to exploit.
