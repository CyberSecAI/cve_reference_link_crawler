The provided content is related to CVE-2023-52916.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by incorrect calculation of the buffer size when capturing video at 1600x900 resolution. The height of the source buffer was not aligned to 8 pixels, which is required because the macro block size is 8x8.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory overwrite: Due to the incorrect buffer size calculation, a memory overwrite can occur when the system memory is under pressure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash: When memory is tight, the memory overwrite leads to system instability and crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Displaying 1600x900 resolution on a host system.
- Mounting an ISO using 'Virtual media' through OpenBMC's web interface.
- Running a script that continuously performs SHA calculations on the mounted ISO, increasing memory usage
- Opening a KVM session on OpenBMC's web interface, triggering the video capture.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to display 1600x900 content on the target system
- The attacker needs to have access to OpenBMC web interface to mount ISOs and open KVM sessions.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute scripts on the target system.

The provided information details the root cause and provides a scenario to trigger the vulnerability, providing more detail than a basic CVE description.
