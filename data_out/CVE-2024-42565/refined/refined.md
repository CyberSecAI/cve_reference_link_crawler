The provided content details a SQL Injection vulnerability in jerryhanjj ERP.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `/index.php/basedata/contact/delete` URI when handling a `DELETE` action. Input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `/index.php/basedata/contact/delete` endpoint, specifically the handling of the `id` parameter in a `DELETE` request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Escalation of Privileges**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially gain elevated privileges by manipulating the database.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `/index.php/basedata/contact/delete` endpoint.
*   The `id` parameter is injected with SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
*   The attacker needs to have access to the network where the application is hosted.
*   The attacker appears to need to be authenticated, as the provided request contains a cookie with an Admin-Token, however it's not clear if that is required for this particular endpoint.
