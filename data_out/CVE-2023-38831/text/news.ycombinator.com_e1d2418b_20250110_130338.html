Before my time ended with Windows 10-12 years ago, this was one of the first programs that I install on a new Windows setup. Feature wise, I haven't seen any tool beat WinRAR. Locking, splitting, recovery support, And my favorite, SFX archives (msi file equivalent). Creating an installation program was dead easy. And they were and still are cool enough to give a perpetual free trial in exchange for a few nagging screens. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [Frost1x](user?id=Frost1x) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37241973)   | [parent](#37240564) | [next](#37239118) [–]  >Feature wise, I haven't seen any tool beat WinRAR.

Either way, it’s a bad scenario - I just would like to know.

Zero day is a surprise exploit that gets used before it is discovered. WinRAR has not fixed this exploit, and since it's proprietary software we don't even know if the company is even aware or even cares. It's also alike a zero day in the other sense that protections against the exploit haven't been developed. While in a real zero day that's because not enough time has passed for volunteers to develop protections, the case here is proprietary software can't be modified by volunteers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [deelowe](user?id=deelowe) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37241576)   | [parent](#37239326) | [prev](#37241288) | [next](#37239438) [–]  Not if the devs weren't aware. Zero day borrows it's terminology from contracts where zero day notice means that no prior notification is needed. A zero day exploit is one that's circulating in the wild prior to their having been a formal disclosure. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wolfi1](user?id=wolfi1) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37239438)   | [parent](#37239326) | [prev](#37241576) | [next](#37239648) [–]  it's a zero-day when it is not patched but still exploited | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dxd](user?id=dxd) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37239648)   | [parent](#37239326) | [prev](#37239438) | [next](#37237082) [–]  I think it means that this exploit has been possible since the application was made, the zeroth day. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [efdee](user?id=efdee) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37239934)   | [root](#37239326) | [parent](#37239648) | [next](#37237082) [–]  It doesn't. Technically, zero-day in the context of exploits means the exploit was circulating and/or being used before the authors of the attacked piece of software were made aware of the vulnerability (or before the vulnerability was made public, or before the day a patch was made available, depending on who you ask). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chankstein38](user?id=chankstein38) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37237082)   | [prev](#37239326) | [next](#37238847) [–]  This may be a good place to ask this. Legitimate question, why do people still use WinRAR and 7zip and stuff? Zip is built into literally everything. I don't really want to have to download another application to unpack something I get. Is there a good reason? It frequently feels like it's used just to make extra work for the downloader | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [AdmiralAsshat](user?id=AdmiralAsshat) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37237535)   | [parent](#37237082) | [next](#37237572) [–]  .7z gets way better compression than .zip, in my experience. Plus, 7-zip can handle the odd archive here and there that I'm forced to download on my corporate PC that Windows cannot. Like a tarball. Finally, the built-in integrity hashing that 7-zip adds to the right-click context menu in Windows is crazy useful. So to answer your question: there are plenty of legitimate reasons to still use 7zip. I can't think of any legitimate reasons to still use WinRAR, though... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LinuxBender](user?id=LinuxBender) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37238002)   | [root](#37237082) | [parent](#37237535) | [next](#37238188) [–]  One advantage of WinRAR over 7-Zip is the option to add recovery data and data parity recovery files. This can of course be accomplished on any file using PAR2 but it saved a step which some people liked. Not everyone needs this option. I create PAR files when I back up important archives to multiple external drives. par2cmdline [1] is in some Linux repositories.

Microsoft will probably have more diligence in hardening the binaries than 7zip too, which resisted enabling basic exploit mitigations like DEP and ASLR until 2018 and *still* doesn't enable the more advanced MSVC mitigations as far as I'm aware.

WinRAR opens a .tar.gz like any other single-format archive (zip, rar, 7z) so it's much much faster, but also more intuitive.

RAR is used on the internet because large files get broken up into smaller parts to get transferred and you can use RAR to determine whether your compressed fileset is legitimate or if it needs repair.

Also, a common gesture I use is 7zip's extensions to the right-click drag file operation. I can select an entire collection of zip files right-click drag it to a different folder and "Extract to \*\" which decompresses all the files into a set of folders (under the folder you are dragging into) using the names of the zip files as the folder names (minus the extension).

It uselessly bloats Windows File Explorer tooltips and dialogs. (Why do I care what some subset of filenames inside the zip file are?)

The reality of almost all open source software is that nobody reads the code and the primary author is struggling to find the time to keep up with maintenance. What's more, doing security review is very hard. You can't just casually read a bit of code. You need to deeply understand the surrounding context. People who have the capability to do that aren't going around providing that service for free. -- More reading for the curious: [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2347:\_Dependency](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2347%3A_Dependency) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [arboles](user?id=arboles) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37242140)   | [root](#37238847) | [parent](#37242032) | [next](#37240860) [–]  Well I'm quite motivated to fix this vulnerability in WinRAR, but I can't. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Strom](user?id=Strom) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37242156)   | [root](#37238847) | [parent](#37242140) | [next](#37240860) [–]  You can, just download the latest version. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [arboles](user?id=arboles) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37242188)   | [root](#37238847) | [parent](#37242156) | [next](#37240860) [–]  What if the software is abandoned or badly maintained?

Software can still be compromised if it is compromised before being signed. Assuming you somehow trust the source code and not the binary, in fact, you're better off compiling it yourself and checking if the non-signed software you get is similar enough to the binary you can get from others - Assuming of course you can actually reach reliable reproducible builds with a Windows build chain, a thing that last time I checked was horrible and flaky. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [reactordev](user?id=reactordev) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37239443)   | [root](#37238847) | [parent](#37239340) | [prev](#37239570) | [next](#37239378) [–]  *apt update && apt install 7zip* | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [heap\_perms](user?id=heap_perms) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37239378)   | [root](#37238847) | [parent](#37238902) | [prev](#37239048) | [next](#37240297) [–]  > 30 million Americans marched in opposition to the Iraq war And it was an illegal.

One example would be NGinx which runs a good deal of websites on the internet. NGinx is now owned by F5 but still maintain the same developers. There is probably a better way to verify code, risk rank flaws and assign a level of trust. This should be an ongoing *and ideally automated* effort regardless of who is contributing code or hardware. I personally would like to see *AI* be able to review entire code bases and see the bigger picture because state sponsored lawful intercepts are rarely one piece of code but rather require multiple pieces of code *and sometimes hardware* to work in conjunction to form the back door. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kgeist](user?id=kgeist) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37238589)   | [root](#37237585) | [parent](#37238292) | [next](#37237976) [–]  Yesterday I learned that a lot of crucial stuff in Postgres was developed by Russians (the list I saw was quite extensive).
