# WinRAR zero-day exploited since April to hack trading accounts

A WinRar zero-day vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-38831 was actively exploited to install malware when clicking on harmless files in an archive, allowing the hackers to breach online cryptocurrency trading accounts.

The vulnerability has been under active exploitation since April 2023, helping distribute various malware families, including DarkMe, GuLoader, and Remcos RAT.

The WinRAR zero-day vulnerability allowed the threat actors to create malicious .RAR and .ZIP archives that displayed seemingly innocuous files, such as JPG (.jpg) images, text files (.txt), or PDF (.pdf) documents.

However, when a user opens the document, the flaw will cause a script to be executed that installs malware on the device.

BleepingComputer tested a malicious archive shared by Group-IB, who discovered the campaign, and simply double-clicking on a PDF caused a CMD script to be executed to install malware.

The zero-day was fixed in [WinRAR version 6.23](http://www.win-rar.com/singlenewsview.html?&L=0&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=232&cHash=c5bf79590657e32554c6683296a8e8aa), released on August 2, 2023, which also resolves several other security issues, [including CVE-2023-40477](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/winrar-flaw-lets-hackers-run-programs-when-you-open-rar-archives/), a flaw that can trigger command execution upon opening a specially crafted RAR file.

## Targeting crypto traders

In a report released today, researchers from Group-IB said they discovered the WinRAR zero-day being used to target cryptocurrency and stock trading forums, where the hackers pretended to be other enthusiasts sharing their trading strategies.

These forum posts contained links to specially crafted WinRAR ZIP or RAR archives that pretended to include the shared trading strategy, consisting of PDFs, text files, and images.

**Promoting malicious archives on a crypto trader forum**
*Source: Group-IB*

The fact that those archives target traders is demonstrated by the forum post titles, like "best Personal Strategy to trade with Bitcoin."

The malicious archives were distributed on at least eight public trading forums, infecting a confirmed 130 traders' devices. The number of victims and financial losses resulting from this campaign are unknown.

When the archives are opened, users will see what appears to be a harmless file, like a PDF, with a folder matching the same file name, as shown below.

However, when the user double-clicks on the PDF, the CVE-2023-38831 vulnerability will quietly launch a script in the folder to install malware on the device.  At the same time, these scripts will also load the decoy document so as not to arouse suspicion.

**Windows CMD script executed by CVE-2023-38831 vulnerability**
*Source: BleepingComputer*

The vulnerability is triggered by creating specially crafted archives with a slightly modified structure compared to safe files, which causes WinRAR's ShellExecute function to receive an incorrect parameter when it attempts to open the decoy file.

This results in the program skipping the harmless file and instead locating and executing a batch or CMD script, so while the user assumes they open a safe file, the program launches a different one.

The script executes to launch a self-extracting (SFX) CAB archive that infects the computer with various malware strains, such as the DarkMe, GuLoader, and Remcos RAT infections, providing remote access to an infected device.

Although the DarkMe malware strain has been associated with the financially motivated EvilNum group, it is unclear who leveraged CVE-2023-38831 in the recently observed campaign.

DarkMe has been previously used in financially motivated attacks, so it's possible that the attackers target traders to steal their crypto assets.

Remcos RAT gives the attackers more powerful control over infected devices, including arbitrary command execution, keylogging, screen capturing, file management, and reverse proxy capabilities, so it could facilitate espionage operations too.

Group-IB discovered CVE-2023-38831 in July 2023, and the security firm has today published a [detailed report](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/cve-2023-38831-winrar-zero-day/) on its in-the-wild exploitation.

Users of WinRAR are urged to upgrade to the latest version, version 6.23 at the time of this writing, as soon as possible to eliminate the risk of file spoofing and other recently-disclosed attacks.

In recent weeks, Google’s Threat Analysis Group’s (TAG) has observed multiple government-backed hacking groups exploiting the known vulnerability, CVE-2023-38831, in WinRAR, which is a popular file archiver tool for Windows. Cybercrime groups began exploiting the vulnerability in early 2023, when the bug was still unknown to defenders. A patch is now available, but many users still seem to be vulnerable. TAG has observed government-backed actors from a number of countries exploiting the WinRAR vulnerability as part of their operations.

To ensure protection, we urge organizations and users to keep software fully up-to-date and to install security updates as soon as they become available. After a vulnerability has been patched, malicious actors will continue to rely on n-days and use slow patching rates to their advantage. We also recommend use of Google’s Safe Browsing and Gmail, which block files containing the exploit.

### Patch and proof-of-concept

In August 2023, RARLabs released an [updated version](https://www.rarlab.com/rarnew.htm) of WinRAR that included fixes for several security-related bugs. One of those bugs, later assigned [CVE-2023-38831](https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild//0day-RCAs/2023/CVE-2023-38831.html), is a logical vulnerability within WinRAR causing extraneous temporary file expansion when processing crafted archives, combined with a quirk in the implementation of Windows’ ShellExecute when attempting to open a file with an extension containing spaces. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user attempts to view a benign file (such as an ordinary PNG file) within a ZIP archive.

As detailed in a [blog post](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/cve-2023-38831-winrar-zero-day/) from Group-IB, the vulnerability had been exploited as 0-day by cybercrime actors in-the-wild since at least April 2023 for campaigns targeting financial traders to deliver various commodity malware families. Hours after the blog post was released, proof of concepts and exploit generators were uploaded to [public GitHub repositories](https://github.com/BoredHackerBlog/winrar_CVE-2023-38831_lazy_poc). Shortly after that, TAG began to observe testing activity from both financially motivated and APT actors experimenting with CVE-2023-38831.

### Vulnerability

Consider the following archive structure:

![a picture of code](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Image_1_-_Consider_the_following.width-100.format-webp.webp)

When a user double-clicks on a benign “poc.png\_” (underscore is used to indicate a space) from WinRAR’s user interface, WinRAR prior to 6.23 will instead execute “poc.png\_/poc.png\_.cmd”.

After a user double-clicks on a file, WinRAR attempts to determine which files need to be temporarily expanded by iterating through all archive entries. However, due to the way the matching is made, if a directory is found with the same name as the selected entry, both the selected file and the files inside a matched directory are extracted to the root of a random temporary directory.

The pseudocode below shows WinRAR’s extraction logic and whether an archive entry should to be extracted:

![a picture of code](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Image_2_-_The_pseudocode_below.width-100.format-webp.webp)

When writing contents of the files, WinRAR performs path normalization that removes appended spaces, because [Windows doesn’t allow files with trailing spaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/shell-experience/file-folder-name-whitespace-characters).

Finally, WinRAR calls [ShellExecuteExW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecuteexw), passing the non-normalized path with a trailing space “%TEMP%\{random\_directory}\poc.png\_” to run the user-selected file. Internally, ShellExecute attempts to identify file extensions by calling “shell32!PathFindExtension” which fails because extensions with spaces are considered invalid. Instead of bailing out, ShellExecute proceeds to call “shell32!ApplyDefaultExts” which iterates through all files in a directory, finding and executing the first file with an extension matching any of the hardcoded ones: “.pif, .com, .exe, .bat, .lnk, .cmd”.

Note, that while most samples exploiting CVE-2023-3883 use an archive entry with a trailing space, it is not a requirement, and a space in any position in the file extension is sufficient to trigger the bug (e.g. entry with “poc.invalid\_ext” will also result in “shell32!ApplyDefaultExts” code path to be taken).

![a box showing lines of code](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Image_3_-_Note_that_while_most_sa.width-100.format-webp.webp)

This quirk in ShellExecute, causing the default extension search logic to be applied when attempting to open a file with an extension containing spaces is what causes “poc.png\_.cmd” to be selected and inadvertently run, even though it was not the file the user originally double-clicked on.

### Campaigns

### FROZENBARENTS impersonates Ukrainian drone training school to deliver Rhadamanthys infostealer

In a [blog post](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/ukraine-remains-russias-biggest-cyber-focus-in-2023/) earlier this year, TAG reported on FROZENBARENTS (aka SANDWORM) targeting the energy sector and continuing hack & leak operations. The group, attributed to Russian Armed Forces’ Main Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) Unit 74455, on September 6th launched an email campaign impersonating a Ukrainian drone warfare training school.

Using a lure themed as an invitation to join the school, the email contained a link to an anonymous file-sharing service, fex[.]net, which delivered a benign decoy PDF document with a drone operator training curriculum and a malicious ZIP file exploiting CVE-2023-38831 titled “Навчальна-програма-Оператори.zip” (Training program operators).

![a decoy document with letters](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Image_4_-_Training_of_drone_opera.width-100.format-webp.webp)

The payload, found in “Навчальна-програма-Оператори.pdf /Навчальна-програма-Оператори.pdf\_.bat” was a packed Rhadamanthys infostealer. Rhadamanthys is a commodity infostealer that is able to collect and exfiltrate browser credentials and session information among other things. It operates on a subscription-based model and can be rented out for as low as $250 for 30 days. Usage of commercially available infostealers, that are typically employed by cybercrime actors, is atypical of FROZENBARENTS.

### FROZENLAKE spear-phishing campaign targeting Ukrainian government organizations hosted on API endpoint testing services

On September 4th, CERT-UA [posted](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5702579) about FROZENLAKE (aka APT28), a group attributed to Russian GRU, using CVE-2023-38831 to deliver malware targeting energy infrastructure. TAG observed that FROZENLAKE used a free hosting provider to serve CVE-2023-38831 to target users in Ukraine. The initial page redirected users to a mockbin site to perform browser checks and redirect to the next stage, which would ensure the visitor was coming from an IPv4 address in Ukraine and would prompt the user to download a file containing a CVE-2023-38831 exploit. The decoy document was an event invitation from Razumkov Centre, a public policy think tank in Ukraine.

### FROZENLAKE using IRONJAW with reverse SSH shell

A sample with a filename “IOC\_09\_11.rar” ([072afea7cae714b44c24c16308da0ef0e5aab36b7a601b310d12f8b925f359e7](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/072afea7cae714b44c24c16308da0ef0e5aab36b7a601b310d12f8b925f359e7)) was uploaded to VirusTotal on September 11th. The sample exploits CVE-2023-38831 to drop a BAT file which opens a decoy PDF file and creates a reverse SSH shell to an attacker controlled IP address, and executes IRONJAW script using PowerShell.

![box showing code](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Image_6_-_IRONJAW_script_using_Po.width-100.format-webp.webp)

IRONJAW is a small PowerShell script that steals browser login data and local state directories, exfiltrating them to a C2 on “http://webhook[.]site/e2831741-d8c8-4971-9464-e52d34f9d611”. IRONJAW was first observed being distributed by ISO files hosted on free hosting providers in late July through early August and attributed to FROZENLAKE. The additional delivery of IRONJAW via exploitation of CVE-2023-38831 and the reverse SSH tunnel were new additions to the typical FROZENLAKE toolkit.

### ISLANDDREAMS delivering BOXRAT in campaign targeting Papua New Guinea

TAG has also observed government-backed groups linked to China exploit CVE-2023-38831. In late August, ISLANDDREAMS (aka APT40) launched a phishing campaign targeting Papua New Guinea. The phishing emails included a Dropbox link to a ZIP archive containing the CVE-2023-38831 exploit, a password-protected decoy PDF, and an LNK file.

Decoy PDF used in ISLANDDREAMS campaign

![decoy PDF reading "password required"](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Image_7_-_Decoy_PDF_used_in_ISLAN.width-100.format-webp.webp)

The next stage payload, ISLANDSTAGER, is either an XOR-encoded DLL found at a hardcoded offset inside of the LNK, or downloaded from a hardcoded URL of a file-sharing service.

![black box showing lines of code](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Image_8_-_The_next_stage_payload_.width-100.format-webp.webp)

ISLANDSTAGER is then executed by starting a legit “ImagingDevices.exe” process which sideloads malicious “STI.dll” from “%ProgramData%\Microsoft\DeviceSync\”. ISLANDSTAGER configures persistence by adding “ImagingDevices.exe” to “CurrentVersion\Run” registry key. It then decodes several layers of shellcode, the last of which is generated using [Donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut), that loads and executes the final payload, BOXRAT, in-memory. BOXRAT is a .NET backdoor that uses Dropbox API as a C2 mechanism.

### Conclusion

The widespread exploitation of the WinRAR bug highlights that exploits for known vulnerabilities can be highly effective, despite a patch being available. Even the most sophisticated attackers will only do what is necessary to accomplish their goals. These recent campaigns exploiting the WinRAR bug underscore the importance of patching and that there is still work to be done to make it easy for users to keep their software secure and up-to-date. TAG will continue to compile and share threat intelligence for the protection of online users and Google products, in the meantime, we encourage organizations and users to keep their software fully up-to-date.

Zero day is a surprise exploit that gets used before it is discovered. WinRAR has not fixed this exploit, and since it's proprietary software we don't even know if the company is even aware or even cares. It's also alike a zero day in the other sense that protections against the exploit haven't been developed. While in a real zero day that's because not enough time has passed for volunteers to develop protections, the case here is proprietary software can't be modified by volunteers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [deelowe](user?id=deelowe) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37241576)   | [parent](#37239326) | [prev](#37241288) | [next](#37239438) [–]  Not if the devs weren't aware.

Technically, zero-day in the context of exploits means the exploit was circulating and/or being used before the authors of the attacked piece of software were made aware of the vulnerability (or before the vulnerability was made public, or before the day a patch was made available, depending on who you ask). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chankstein38](user?id=chankstein38) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37237082)   | [prev](#37239326) | [next](#37238847) [–]  This may be a good place to ask this. Legitimate question, why do people still use WinRAR and 7zip and stuff? Zip is built into literally everything. I don't really want to have to download another application to unpack something I get. Is there a good reason? It frequently feels like it's used just to make extra work for the downloader | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [AdmiralAsshat](user?id=AdmiralAsshat) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37237535)   | [parent](#37237082) | [next](#37237572) [–]  .7z gets way better compression than .zip, in my experience. Plus, 7-zip can handle the odd archive here and there that I'm forced to download on my corporate PC that Windows cannot. Like a tarball. Finally, the built-in integrity hashing that 7-zip adds to the right-click context menu in Windows is crazy useful. So to answer your question: there are plenty of legitimate reasons to still use 7zip. I can't think of any legitimate reasons to still use WinRAR, though... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LinuxBender](user?id=LinuxBender) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37238002)   | [root](#37237082) | [parent](#37237535) | [next](#37238188) [–]  One advantage of WinRAR over 7-Zip is the option to add recovery data and data parity recovery files.

I can select an entire collection of zip files right-click drag it to a different folder and "Extract to \*\" which decompresses all the files into a set of folders (under the folder you are dragging into) using the names of the zip files as the folder names (minus the extension). This is a useful and surprisingly common operation.

It's that the engineers and their families are currently in Russia. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ThrowAway1922A](user?id=ThrowAway1922A) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37239694)   | [root](#37237585) | [parent](#37239322) | [next](#37237976) [–]  I don't what to get accused of whataboutism, but when it comes to software if this is the bar we're setting than no software can be considered safe. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nirui](user?id=nirui) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37237976)   | [parent](#37237585) | [prev](#37238292) | [next](#37237742) [–]  How is that conclusion came to mind? Did they wrote the entire code in Russian or the code just don't run on Russian computers? If you don't know, this is not even the first file compression related exploit. "Zip Slip"(0) for example, is just one year old, and there are many of them out there.

It seems that there are capable Russians about data compression. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [catboybotnet](user?id=catboybotnet) [on Aug 23, 2023](item?id=37236942)   | [prev](#37237585) [–]  If you're downloading random files from a stranger's vague post, then I think you had it coming.
