Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a logical flaw in WinRAR's processing of crafted archives, specifically related to how it handles temporary file expansion and a quirk in Windows' ShellExecute function when opening files with extensions containing spaces.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect parameter handling**: When attempting to open a file within a specially crafted archive, WinRAR's `ShellExecute` function receives an incorrect file path.
- **Path Normalization Bypass:** WinRAR normalizes paths by removing trailing spaces but passes a non-normalized path to `ShellExecuteExW`.
- **ShellExecute Extension Handling:**  `ShellExecute` fails to identify file extensions containing spaces and, instead of failing, incorrectly applies default extension search logic (`shell32!ApplyDefaultExts`).
- This causes execution of a different file than the user intended (e.g., a `.cmd` script instead of a `.png` image).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Attackers can execute malicious scripts or programs when a user attempts to open a seemingly harmless file within a malicious archive.
- Malware installation: This vulnerability has been used to distribute various malware families, including DarkMe, GuLoader, and Remcos RAT, enabling remote access and data theft.
- Financial loss: Exploitation has been targeted towards cryptocurrency and stock traders, leading to potential financial losses by stealing crypto assets and trading account access.
- Data theft: The installed malware can steal browser credentials, session information, and other sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious archive files: Attackers create specially crafted .RAR and .ZIP archives containing a harmless decoy file and a malicious script.
- Social engineering: Attackers distribute these archives through methods like forum posts, email phishing, or file sharing services.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create specially crafted RAR/ZIP archives.
- Ability to distribute these archives to the intended victims.
- No specific user privileges are needed for exploitation, as the vulnerability triggers when a user attempts to open a file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was exploited as a zero-day since at least April 2023.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user double-clicks a file within the archive.
-  The vulnerability can be triggered even if the space is not at the end of the extension (e.g., `poc.invalid_ext`).
- Government-backed groups have also been observed exploiting this vulnerability, and it's not just limited to cybercriminals.
- The exploit has been seen used in campaigns targeting Ukraine and Papua New Guinea.
- Various APT groups like FROZENBARENTS, FROZENLAKE, and ISLANDDREAMS were observed using this vulnerability.
- Public proof-of-concepts and exploit generators are available.

This vulnerability was fixed in WinRAR version 6.23.
