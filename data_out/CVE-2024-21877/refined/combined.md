#### ENSA-2024-2: Insecure Cache File Generation Based on User Input (IQ Gateway 4.x through 8.2.4224)

**Advisory ID:**
ENSA-2024-2

**CVSSv3:**
8.6

**Issue date:**
2024-08-10

**Updated on:**
2024-08-10 (initial advisory)

**CVE(s):**
CVE-2024-21877

**Synopsis:**
Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability through a URL parameter in Enphase IQ Gateway allows File Manipulation. The endpoint requires authentication. This issue affects IQ Gateway version 4.x through 8.2.4224.

---

### **1. Impacted product**

Enphase IQ Gateway 4.x through 8.2.4224

### **2. Introduction**

Dutch research organization DIVD is publishing an advisory identifying a vulnerability. An update is available to address this issue.

### **3. Summary**

**Description:**
Enphase IQ Gateway 4.x through 8.2.4224 allows file manipulation via a path traversal opportunity, when the IQ Gateway is modified to obtain a public IP address and connect to the public internet.

**Known attack vectors:**
A malicious actor may be able to exploit this opportunity if the IQ Gateway is modified to obtain a public IP address and connect to the public internet.

**Resolution:**
Upgrading the Enphase IQ Gateway embedded software to 8.2.4225 or newer.

**Workarounds:**
Ensure that your IQ Gateway is not exposed to the public internet, as it is not needed to do so for typical functionality. A typical solution is to use an internet router.

**Additional documentation:**
None.

**Acknowledgments:**
Enphase would like to thank the researcher Wietse Boonstra and the organization DIVD for reporting this issue.

**Notes:**
None.
