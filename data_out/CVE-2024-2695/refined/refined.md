Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `shariff` shortcode of the Shariff Wrapper plugin. Specifically, the `borderradius`, `services`, and `timestamp` attributes are not properly handled, allowing for injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious scripts injected through shortcode attributes are stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `borderradius`, `services`, and `timestamp` attributes of the `shariff` shortcode. This allows for arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code injection.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output of the unsanitized attributes, leading to the execution of the injected malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** Depending on the injected script, attackers could perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or further malicious activities.
*   **Website Defacement:** The injected scripts could be used to deface the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect victims to malicious websites or distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code by crafting a `shariff` shortcode with malicious payloads in the vulnerable attributes such as `borderradius`, `services`, and `timestamp`.
*   **Page/Post Insertion:** The crafted shortcode is inserted into a WordPress page or post, where it will be executed when a user visits the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** Attackers need to have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This means they need to be able to create and edit posts or pages to insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Shariff Wrapper plugin versions up to and including 4.6.13.
*   The fix is included in version 4.6.14.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ngô Thiên An (ancorn\_) - VNPT-VCI.
*   The provided code diffs show changes related to sanitization and escaping in the affected files (`admin/admin-menu.php`, `shariff.php`, and `updates.php`).

In summary, CVE-2024-2695 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the Shariff Wrapper plugin that allows authenticated users with contributor-level access to inject and execute arbitrary scripts. The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization and escaping of user-controlled inputs, primarily within the `shariff` shortcode, specifically the `borderradius`, `services` and `timestamp` attributes.
