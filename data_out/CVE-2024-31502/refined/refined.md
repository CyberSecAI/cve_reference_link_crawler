**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly restrict access to the `new_staff` functionality. A user with lower privileges (User role) can directly access the `new_staff` functionality typically reserved for administrators or higher privileged users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Vertical Privilege Escalation:** A lower-privileged user can perform actions that should be reserved for higher-privileged users (creating a staff account).
- **Missing Access Controls:** The application lacks proper checks to verify if the user accessing the `/admin/core/new_staff` endpoint has the necessary permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Creation of unauthorized accounts:** A low-privileged user can create a new Staff account, effectively gaining higher privileges within the application.
- **Data compromise:**  The attacker can then leverage the created account to access sensitive information, and perform actions intended for staff users.
- **Full system control:** Potentially leads to complete compromise if staff accounts have full control

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct Access to Privileged Endpoint:** By directly sending a POST request to the `/e-insurance/Script./admin/core/new_staff` endpoint, bypassing the intended user interface.
- **HTTP Method manipulation:** Changing the request method from GET to POST.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low privileged User account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with low privileges in the application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint path `/e-insurance/Script./admin/core/new_staff`.
- **Capability to manipulate HTTP requests:** The attacker should be able to use a web proxy to modify the request method and post data.
