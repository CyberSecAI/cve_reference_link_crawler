Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the Packers and Movers Management System v1.0, specifically in the `manage_user` functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `/mpms/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=` URL. It doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries. This is demonstrated in the content where the attacker is able to extract the database name via `database()`.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Complete System Takeover (Potentially):** With SQL injection, a skilled attacker may eventually gain full access to the server, depending on the database user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to `/mpms/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=` by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application (in this case `192.168.1.88`).
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the application and how to craft SQL injection payloads.
*   **Authenticated access (admin) to the application is needed to reach the vulnerable page**: The provided username/password `admin:admin123` suggests that this is an admin page.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id` in `/mpms/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=`
*   **Payload Example:** `id=-7' union select 1,2,database(),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--+`
*   **Exploit Technique:** The attacker uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract database information.
