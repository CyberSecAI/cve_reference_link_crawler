Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the Tongda OA system.
*   The root cause is the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`$VU_ID`) into a SQL query within the `general/vehicle/query/delete.php` route without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Direct Parameter Splicing:** The code directly includes the `$VU_ID` parameter into the SQL statement when it's not empty.
*   **Bypass through parenthesis closing:** The use of parentheses in the SQL query allows for a bypass of some basic sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database.
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** The attacker can use blind SQL injection techniques to extract information about the database structure, such as table names, column names, and data types.
*   **Complete Compromise:** Depending on database permissions, the attacker could potentially gain complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `$VU_ID` parameter within a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `delete.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Tongda OA instance.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques and blind injection methods to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No authentication requirement mentioned in the provided text**

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `$VU_ID`.
*   The code is concise and directly uses the parameter in the SQL statement.
*   The exploit uses a blind SQL injection technique with a time delay to confirm the successful injection and extract information character by character.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to determine the first few characters of the database name.
*   The attacker is using a Cartesian product to induce a time delay.

**Payload Example:**

The provided content includes example payloads for extracting the database name character by character, for instance, to determine if the first character is "t":
```sql
1)%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),1,1))=char(116)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B)%20and(1)=(1
```
This payload leverages time-based blind SQL injection using a Cartesian product.
