- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `PrestaPDFProductListModuleFrontController::queryDb()` method of the RSI PDF/HTML catalog evolution (prestapdf) module for PrestaShop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89). The module fails to properly sanitize user-supplied parameters (`id_product`, `langs`, `skipcat`) before using them in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
    - Complete takeover of the PrestaShop installation.
    - Full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction are required. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without any prior authentication.

The advisory also notes that the author of the module refused to patch the vulnerability, and recommends uninstalling the module. It also states that while newer versions might have some changes, the token is still predictable, and therefore, all versions should be considered impacted.
