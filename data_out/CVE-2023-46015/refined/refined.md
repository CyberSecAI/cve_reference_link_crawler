- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data in the `msg` parameter of the `index.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the victim's browser within the context of the affected site, potentially compromising their security and privacy.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `msg` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL containing the XSS payload to the victim. The attack is local, which likely means the attacker and victim need to share the same environment (local network for example).

**Additional details:**
- The affected software is Code-Projects Blood Bank V1.0.
- The vulnerable file is `/index.php`.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided: `http://localhost/bloodbank/index.php?msg=<div><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`
