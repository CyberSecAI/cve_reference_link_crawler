Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `OrderController.java` component of Hitout carsale V1.0. Specifically, the `orderBy` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses user-supplied input (`orderBy` parameter) in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including customer information, order details, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/order/getList` endpoint, manipulating the `orderBy` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they don't need any special access to the internal network.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests to craft the malicious `orderBy` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable `orderBy` parameter is used in the `/order/getList` endpoint of the `OrderController.java` component.
- The provided example shows a request where the `orderBy` parameter is set to `createTime+asc`. By modifying this value, the attacker can inject SQL code.
