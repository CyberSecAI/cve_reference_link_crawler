- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in the GlobalProtect portal allows an authenticated user to impersonate another user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect authorization (CWE-863), leading to user impersonation.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - A malicious authenticated GlobalProtect user can impersonate another GlobalProtect user.
    - The impersonated user is disconnected from GlobalProtect.
    - PAN-OS logs indicate that the impersonated user authenticated, hiding the attacker's identity.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated GlobalProtect user with low privileges. No user interaction is required.
