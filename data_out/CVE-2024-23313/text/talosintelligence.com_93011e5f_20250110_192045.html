# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1922

## The Biosig Project libbiosig sopen\_FAMOS\_read integer underflow to out-of-bounds write vulnerability

##### February 20, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-23313

##### SUMMARY

An integer underflow vulnerability exists in the sopen\_FAMOS\_read functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 2.5.0 and Master Branch (ab0ee111). A specially crafted .famos file can lead to an out-of-bounds write which in turn can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

The Biosig Project libbiosig 2.5.0

The Biosig Project libbiosig Master Branch (ab0ee111)

##### PRODUCT URLS

libbiosig - <https://biosig.sourceforge.net/index.html>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-191 - Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)

##### DETAILS

Libbiosig is an open source library designed to process various types of medical signal data (EKG, EEG, etc) within a vast variety of different file formats. Libbiosig is also at the core of biosig APIs in Octave and Matlab, sigviewer, and other scientific software utilized for interpreting biomedical signal data.

When reading in or writing out data of any filetype, libbiosig will always end up hitting the `sopen_extended` function:

```
HDRTYPE* sopen_extended(const char* FileName, const char* MODE, HDRTYPE* hdr, biosig_options_type *biosig_options) {
/*
    MODE="r"
        reads file and returns HDR
    MODE="w"
        writes HDR into file
 */

```

This is where the vast majority of parsing logic is for most file types, albeit with some exceptions to this generalization which end up calling more specific `sopen_*` functions. Regardless, unless specifically stated, it’s safe to assume we’re somewhere in this extremely large function. The general flow of `sopen_extended` is as one might expect: initialize generic structures, figure out what file type we’re dealing with, parse the filetype, and finally populate the generic structures that can be utilized by whatever is calling `sopen_extended`. To determine file type, `sopen_extended` calls `getfiletype`, which goes through a list of magic byte comparisons. Alternatively we could force a particular file type, but this is generally more useful when writing data to a file.

Moving on from the generic overview, we can get to be more specific. For our current vulnerability we deal with the imc FAMOS file format, a generic format for quick data analysis. To figure out if we’re dealing with a .famos file, `getfiletype` runs the following magic-byte check:

```
else if (!memcmp(Header1,"|CF,",4))
        hdr->TYPE = FAMOS;

```

Simple enough, and assuming we find a .famos file, `sopen_extended` hits the following branch:

```
#ifdef WITH_FAMOS
        else if (hdr->TYPE==FAMOS) {
            hdr->HeadLen=count;
            sopen_FAMOS_read(hdr);
    }
#endif

```

Worth noting that while the famos file format can be disabled with the `WITH_FAMOS` compiler flag, by default it is enabled. Continuing on into `sopen_FAMOS_read`:

```
EXTERN_C void sopen_FAMOS_read(HDRTYPE* hdr) {
#define Header1 ((char*)hdr->AS.Header)

        size_t count = hdr->HeadLen;

        char *t, *t2;
        const char EOL[] = "|;\xA\xD";
        size_t pos, l1, len;
        pos  = strspn(Header1, EOL);   // [1]
        uint16_t gdftyp, CHAN=0;
        char OnOff=1;
        double Fs = NAN;
        uint32_t NoChanCurrentGroup = 0;    // number of (undefined) channels of current group
        int level = 0;  // to check consistency of file

        char flag_AbstandFile = 0;      // interleaved format ??? used for experimental code

        fprintf(stdout,"SOPEN(FAMOS): support is experimental. Only time series with equidistant sampling and single sampling rate are supported.\n"); // [2]

        while (pos < count-20) { // [3]
            t       = Header1+pos;  // start of line // [4]

            l1      = strcspn(t+5, ","); // [5]
            t[l1+5] = 0;
            len     = atol(t+5);  // [6]
            pos    += 6+l1;
            t2      = Header1+pos;  // start of line // [7]
            if (count < max(pos,hdr->HeadLen)+256) { // HeadLen can be updated... //[8]
                    size_t bufsiz = 4095;
                    hdr->AS.Header = (uint8_t*)realloc(hdr->AS.Header, count+bufsiz+1); // [9]
                    count += ifread(hdr->AS.Header+count,1,bufsiz,hdr);
            }
            pos    += len+1;

        // [...]
        pos += strcspn(Header1+pos,EOL);
        pos += strspn(Header1+pos,EOL);
    }

```

To start, our code skips over any sort of newlines or delimiter at [1], and then prints out the fact that FAMOS support is experimental [2]. Heeding this warning, our input file proceeds with caution as we enter the main logic loop at [3]. The variables `t` [4] is saved to denote the start of the line, `l1` [5] is the length of our current line (the +5 is there since the tags denoting data type are 4 bytes long), `len` ends up being the length of the data of the current line, and finally `t2` ends up pointing to the actual start of our data for the current line. Assuming that our `count` variable is smaller than the position of where we’re about to start reading plus 0xFF [8], then we end up reallocating our memory buffer and reading in more of the file into it [9]. To see how each opcode or tag is parsed within our file, we examine a sample opcode in the logic below:

```
        if (!strncmp(t,"CF,2",4) && (level==0)) {
            level = 1;
        }
        else if (!strncmp(t,"CK,1",4) && (level==1)) {
            level = 2;
        }
        else if (!strncmp(t,"NO,1",4) && ((level==1) || (level==2))) {
                  // [...]
        }
        else if (!strncmp(t,"CT,1",4) && (level>1)) {
        }

        else if (!strncmp(t,"Cb,1",4))  // Buffer Beschreibung         // [10]
        {
            // AnzahlBufferInKey
            int p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            if (atoi(t2) != 1) {
                biosigERROR(hdr, B4C_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED, "FAMOS: more than one buffer not supported");lll
            }
            // BytesInUserInfo
            t2 += 1+p;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            // Buffer Referenz
            t2 += 1+p;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            // IndexSamplesKey
            t2 += 1+p;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            // OffsetBufferInSamplesKey
            t2 += 1+p;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            hdr->CHANNEL[CHAN].bi = atol(t2); // [11]

```

Which parsing code we hit is determined first by the first four bytes of our line, and then an internal state machine variable is checked. While not all opcodes require a particular state (e.g. [10]), as seen above, most do. Continuing on in the branch at [13], assuming any given line in our input file starts with “Cb,1”, we then search the rest of that line for five commas, turn all of them into null bytes such that these fields can be parsed later. The first example of this parsing is at [11], where we populate a `hdr->CHANNEL`’s `bi` member with a signed long. Importantly, this particular line itself is but one example of a more general idea - that we can write into the `hdr->CHANNEL[CHAN]` at various spots, and our task with FAMOS files is generally to find interesting spots to turn these into heap writes. For this particular writeup, there’s a spot inside `sopen_FAMOS_read` where we can `realloc` the `hdr->CHANNEL` buffer, which will become very interesting very quickly:

```
        else if (!strncmp(t,"CG,1",4)) // Definition eines Datenfeldes     // [12]
        {
            int p;
            // Anzahl Komponenten
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            NoChanCurrentGroup = atol(t2);  // additional channels // [13]
            hdr->NS += NoChanCurrentGroup;
            // Feldtyp
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            OnOff = 1;
            if (atoi(t2) != 1) {
        //          OnOff = 0;
        //          biosigERROR(hdr, B4C_DATATYPE_UNSUPPORTED, "FAMOS: data is not real and aquidistant sampled");
            }
            // Dimension
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;

            hdr->CHANNEL = (CHANNEL_TYPE*)realloc(hdr->CHANNEL, hdr->NS*sizeof(CHANNEL_TYPE));   // [14]
            level = 3;   // [15]
        }

```

Assuming we have a line something like: `CG,1,8,4,11,12;;;` [12], then the nine is treated as the size of the data and the following 0x4 is put into the `uint32_t NoChanCurrentGroup` variable [13]. At [14], `hdr->NS` is advanced by this same amount, and then we realloc our`hdr->CHANNEL` buffer by a multiplier of this same amount. A quick relavant tangent to the above code snippet - what types do all these variables happen to be? Well `hdr->NS` happens to be a `uint16_t`, `NoChanCurrentGroup` happens to be a `uint32_t`, and `sizeof(CHANNEL_TYPE)` is `0x158`, all of which will become relevant further on. Also useful to note, our state machine has now been set to `level = 3` at [15]. For fun, let us now assume that our next ten lines are all `CC,1,1,1;`:

```
        else if (!strncmp(t,"CC,1",4) && (level>=3)) {
            if (NoChanCurrentGroup<1) {                           // [15]
                biosigERROR(hdr, B4C_UNSPECIFIC_ERROR, "FAMOS: too many CC definitions in group");
            }
            CHAN = hdr->NS - NoChanCurrentGroup--;  // [16]

            if (CHAN==0)
                hdr->SampleRate = Fs;
            else if (OnOff && (fabs(hdr->SampleRate - Fs)>1e-9*Fs)) {
                fprintf(stdout,"ERR2: %i %f %f\n",CHAN,hdr->SampleRate, Fs);
                // biosigERROR(hdr, B4C_DATATYPE_UNSUPPORTED, "FAMOS: multiple sampling rates not supported");
            }
            if (VERBOSE_LEVEL>7)
                fprintf(stdout,"CC: %i#%i Fs=%f,%i\n",OnOff,CHAN,Fs,(int)len);

            level = 4;   // [17]
        }

```

We’ve established that our `NoChanCurrentGroup` is currently 0x4, and so we pass by the branch at [15] (which honestly doesn’t matter because `biosigERROR` just sets flags in the `hdr` struct that do not get checked here). Next up at [16], the `uint16_t CHAN` variable is set to `hdr->NS - NoChanCurrentGroup--;` at [16]. Since we’re hitting this code ten times, and there’s nothing to stop us from doing so, each time we hit this NoChanGroupCurrent group decrements and decrements until it underflows eventually from 0x4 to 0xFFFFFFFE, and so when we subtract `0x4 - 0xFFFFFFFE`, i.e. `0x4 - (-2)` we end up with 0x6, a `CHAN` variable that is bigger than `hdr->NS`. Continuing on, with everything set in place, we have a few places to actually trigger this vulnerability. To keep it simple, let’s examine the `Cb` opcode once again, and assume that our input line now contains `Cb,1,18,1,1,1,1,333,1,1,1;`:

```
 else if (!strncmp(t,"Cb,1",4))  // Buffer Beschreibung
        {
            // AnzahlBufferInKey
            int p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            if (atoi(t2) != 1) {
                biosigERROR(hdr, B4C_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED, "FAMOS: more than one buffer not supported");lll
            }
            // BytesInUserInfo
            t2 += 1+p;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            // Buffer Referenz
            t2 += 1+p;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            // IndexSamplesKey
            t2 += 1+p;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            // OffsetBufferInSamplesKey
            t2 += 1+p;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;
            hdr->CHANNEL[CHAN].bi = atol(t2); // [18]

```

Skipping all the boiler plate parsing code that was already covered up at [10], we hit the `atol(t2)` with an input-controlled value of `333`. This time however, we know that `hdr->CHANNEL` only contains four channels, whilst the `CHAN` offset is `0x6`, resulting in an out-of-bounds write on the heap. This process can be repeated as much as needed since the “CC” opcode can be repeated without limit, and the other opcodes that writes to `hdr->CHANNEL[CHAN]` offsets can also be repeated. These facts can quickly and potentially contribute to code execution.
