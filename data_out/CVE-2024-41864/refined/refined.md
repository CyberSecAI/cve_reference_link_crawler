- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A critical out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Adobe Substance 3D Designer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the local system. The user interaction is required as well.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have local access to the system where Adobe Substance 3D Designer is installed and require user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
