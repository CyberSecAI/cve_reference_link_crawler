Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** Exposure of a client secret in the 'DELICIA' mini-app on Line.

**Root Cause:** The client secret, a critical credential, is being exposed to the client-side via an API response. Specifically, the response of the request `https://api/retailstudio.jp/api/v2/get_media_info` contains the secret.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Secret:** The client secret should never be exposed to the client-side. It's a sensitive piece of information that should be securely stored and managed on the server-side.
*   **Insecure API Response:** The API endpoint (`https://api/retailstudio.jp/api/v2/get_media_info`) is returning the client secret in its response, making it accessible to anyone who can intercept or access the API response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Channel Access Token Acquisition:** The exposed client secret can be used to obtain the channel access token.
*   **Malicious Broadcasts:** With the channel access token, attackers can broadcast malicious messages to all users of the affected mini-app. These messages could contain links to malicious websites, phishing scams, or other fraudulent content.
*   **Compromised Communication Channel:** The channel access token is supposed to secure the communication channel within Line. By obtaining this token, an attacker effectively compromises this channel, making it possible to send unauthorized and malicious communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Interception:** Attackers could potentially intercept the API request/response using a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Client-Side Access:** Attackers can access the exposed secret by inspecting the API response on the client-side (e.g. using developer tools).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs a copy of the Line app installed.
*   The attacker needs to open the DELICIA mini-app within Line.
*   The attacker needs to be able to either intercept the API request or access the response from the client side.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected version is Line 13.6.1
*   The content provides more details than the typical CVE description, including the specific API endpoint, the method of exploitation, and the impact.
*   The report contains supporting figures illustrating the leakage of the client secret and the use of the client secret to acquire the channel access token.
