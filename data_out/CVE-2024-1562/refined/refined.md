Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Missing Authorization

**Root Cause:**
The `execute_post_data` function within the `wc_gsheetconnector_Service` class lacks a proper capability check. This function is responsible for updating the plugin's settings based on POST data. Due to the missing check, the function can be accessed and executed by unauthenticated users.

**Weakness:**
- Missing authorization check: The core issue is that the `execute_post_data` function does not verify if the user initiating the action has the necessary permissions (e.g., administrator privileges).
- Unprotected settings update: The plugin's settings can be modified by unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized Settings Modification**: Attackers can modify the plugin's settings, potentially disrupting its intended functionality.
-   **Data Manipulation:** By changing the linked Google Sheet or settings, attackers could potentially alter the data being sent to/from the sheet.

**Attack Vector:**
-   Unauthenticated HTTP POST request: Attackers can send a POST request to the WordPress admin endpoint, targeting the `execute_post_data` function, without needing to log in or have any specific roles on the site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   No authentication or special privileges needed: The attacker doesn't need any valid credentials or special position to exploit the vulnerability
-   Knowledge of target endpoint: The attacker must be able to send a POST request to the plugin's admin endpoint with the necessary parameters

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability was found by Francesco Carlucci.
-   The fix involves implementing proper authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can modify plugin settings.
- The vulnerable function is `execute_post_data` in `/includes/class-wc-gsheetconnector-services.php`.
- The nonce check is present, but the role/capability check was not properly implemented.
- The fix was included in version 1.3.13.
