- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of the `url` parameter in the `insta_parser.php` script within the "SocialFeed - Photos & Video/Reels using Instagram API" module for PrestaShop. This allows an attacker to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - The vulnerable website can be used as a proxy to attack other websites.
    - Exfiltration of data from files under IP restriction.
    - Performing path traversal attacks using file:// wrapper.
    - Bypassing WAF/.htaccess restrictions.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction. They can exploit the vulnerability by making a trivial HTTP call to the vulnerable script.
