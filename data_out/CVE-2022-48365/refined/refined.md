The provided content is related to **CVE-2022-48365**. Although the CVE itself is a placeholder, the content provides details on the vulnerability that was addressed under the advisory **IBEXA-SA-2022-009**, which includes a vulnerability related to role assignments. It also includes other vulnerabilities related to GraphQL, content type editing and drafts tooltips.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Subtree limitation for role assignment policy does not have any effect.

*   **Root cause:** The application failed to enforce subtree limitations when assigning roles.
*   **Weaknesses:** Incorrect implementation of role assignment logic, specifically related to subtree limitations.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Users with the "Company admin" role (or any user with the role/assign policy) could assign any role to any other user, regardless of subtree limitations, potentially escalating privileges.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the user management interface when assigning roles.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a user account with the "Company admin" role (or another role with the role/assign policy) .
    *   The attacker needs access to the user management interface.
*   **Affected versions:** Ibexa DXP v3.3.\*, v4.2.\*, eZ Platform v2.5.\*
*   **Fixed in versions:** Ibexa DXP v3.3.28, v4.2.3, eZ Platform v2.5.31

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
*   The advisory also addresses other vulnerabilities:
    *   **GraphQL data exposure (CVE-2022-41876):** GraphQL endpoint exposes sensitive data of certain users, including password hashes, hash types, email addresses, and login names. Requires regenerating GraphQL schema after update.
    *   **XSS in Content Type:** JavaScript XSS injection possible in content type names and short names, requiring content type edit permissions to exploit.
    *   **HTML Injection in Backend Tooltips:** Injection of HTML tags (including links) into content draft names leading to phishing attacks. Requires ability to create content drafts to exploit.
* The provided Github commit details the code changes related to fixing the role assignment issue.
* The Github advisories GHSA-8h83-chh2-fchp and GHSA-99r3-xmmq-7q7g are related to this vulnerability in ezplatform-kernel and ezpublish-kernel respectively.
