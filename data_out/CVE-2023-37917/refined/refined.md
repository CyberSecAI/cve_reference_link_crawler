- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A normal user has the ability to create or update user accounts and can modify the `isadmin` field in the request to `true`, granting themselves administrator privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization and privilege management. The system does not properly validate the user's permissions before allowing them to modify the `isadmin` field.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation, where a normal user can become an administrator, gaining full control over the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through network requests, where a normal user can manipulate the parameters of a user creation or update request to set the `isadmin` field to `true`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid, low-privileged user account within the application. They need to be able to make network requests to the server.
