Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `User.php` file of the Sourcecodester Car Driving School Management System v1.0.
- The system directly incorporates the `id` parameter received via the GET method into an SQL query without any sanitization or security filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary database information disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to read sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The `id` parameter is passed through a GET request.
- **Direct parameter manipulation:** The attacker directly manipulates the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL, specifically the `Users.php?f=delete` endpoint.
- While the provided exploit POC uses an authenticated session, the core vulnerability is exploitable without the authentication part. It is not clear if the application requires authentication to access the affected endpoint.
