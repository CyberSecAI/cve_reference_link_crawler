Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-43698:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data when constructing web pages.

**Weakness:**

- Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the client's browser. This can lead to various impacts, including stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious code into the website via an HTTP request.
- The vulnerable component is the RDT400 within the SICK APU.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be unprivileged and remote.
- User interaction is required; the user needs to visit the manipulated website for the malicious script to execute.
