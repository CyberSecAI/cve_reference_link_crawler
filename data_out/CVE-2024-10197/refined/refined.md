The provided content relates to CVE-2024-10197.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `address` parameter when updating supplier information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization on the `address` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking
- Theft of sensitive data (e.g., authentication tokens)
- Privilege escalation
- Website defacement and manipulation of critical records
- Phishing attacks to trick users or administrators into disclosing personal information.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor crafts a request containing malicious Javascript in the `address` parameter
- The application saves the malicious script to the database
- When the affected supplier record is accessed, the stored Javascript is executed in the victim's browser

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/php/manage_supplier.php` endpoint.
- The attacker would need to have sufficient access to the application to modify supplier records, which could require authentication or authorization.
