| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c0)  Jennifer Sutton    2023-10-09 23:03:01 UTC  ``` The KDC doesn’t allocate enough memory for the ‘heim_octet_string’ containing the freshness token. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c1)  Andrew Bartlett    2023-10-10 20:44:37 UTC  ``` This is hard to score.  If there is any impact at all, it is likely to be a DoS, but there is a chance that some other other thing is in the area the malloc() result pointer is written do.  Repeated testing on x86_64 Linux has not even seen a crash.   <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H>   Either way, while a CVE has been requested (to ensure that everyone picks up Samba 4.19.1 next week with this in it), a new security release feels unwarranted.   (I had scored this as 5.0 previously which is why this didn't get discussed, but re-scoring today I get a higher score for some reason). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c2)  Andrew Bartlett    2023-10-10 22:07:06 UTC  ``` Update, this requires authentication, so   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H (5.9) ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c3)  Samba QA Contact    2023-10-13 00:12:05 UTC  ``` This bug was referenced in samba master:  3280893ae80507e36653a0c7da03c82b88ece30b ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c4)  Jennifer Sutton    2023-10-13 00:34:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 18156](attachment.cgi?id=18156 "patch for Samba 4.19") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18156&action=edit "patch for Samba 4.19") patch for Samba 4.19 ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c5)  Jennifer Sutton    2023-10-15 22:05:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 18158](attachment.cgi?id=18158 "patch v2 for Samba 4.19") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18158&action=edit "patch v2 for Samba 4.19") patch v2 for Samba 4.19 ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c6)  Andrew Bartlett    2023-10-16 01:08:26 UTC  ``` Assigning to Jule for Samba 4.19.2 ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c7)  Jule Anger    2023-10-16 07:30:36 UTC  ``` Pushed to autobuild-v4-19-test. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c8)  Samba QA Contact    2023-10-16 08:29:04 UTC  ``` This bug was referenced in samba v4-19-test:  f0da8219262ba7c3e066d4f519063edf26f36b88 ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c9)  Jule Anger    2023-10-16 13:21:55 UTC  ``` Closing out bug report.  Thanks! ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=15491#c10)  Samba QA Contact    2023-10-16 14:20:32 UTC  ``` This bug was referenced in samba v4-19-stable (Release samba-4.19.2):  f0da8219262ba7c3e066d4f519063edf26f36b88 ``` |  |
