Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10163

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `movie_details.php` file of the "Sentiment Based Movie Success Rating Prediction System" version 1.0. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`id` parameter from the GET request) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input validation and sanitization when handling the `id` parameter in the `movie_details.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
    *   **Direct Parameter Insertion:** The code directly embeds the user-provided `id` value into the SQL query string, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information, such as database names, user credentials, or other confidential data, depending on the database privileges.
    *   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, it could even lead to complete compromise of the database server and the hosting system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request targeting the `movie_details.php` file with a manipulated `id` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server hosting the application.
    *   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious queries.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can likely be exploited without needing user authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/msrps/movie_details.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id` parameter in the GET request.
*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet (from `movie_details.php`):**

```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['id'])){
    $qry = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM `movie_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}'");
    // ...
}
?>
```

*   **Payload Example:**

```
GET /msrps/?page=movie_details&id=-1' union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13--+ HTTP/1.1
```
This payload injects a SQL union query which can be used to extract data from the database.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided github link includes a proof of concept and an image demonstrating the vulnerability
* The vulnerable code snippet shows that the `id` parameter is used to directly create a SQL query.

This vulnerability provides a good example of a classic SQL Injection attack, due to poor coding practices.
