**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection flaw in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input before passing it to the underlying operating system. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands that will be executed by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary OS Command Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected system.
