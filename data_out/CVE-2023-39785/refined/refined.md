Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper bounds checking when handling the `list` parameter in the `/goform/SetNetControlList` route of the Tenda AC8V4 router's firmware. The `list` parameter is passed through `websGetVar` and then into the `set_qosMib_list` function. Inside this function, a `strcpy` operation is used to copy the contents of the `list` parameter to a local stack variable without validating the length of the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow caused by using `strcpy` to copy user-supplied data to a fixed-size stack buffer.
- **Unsafe Function:** The use of `strcpy`, which does not perform any bounds checking, is inherently unsafe and leads to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted `list` parameter that exceeds the size of the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite critical data on the stack, leading to a crash and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint, where the attacker controls the value of the `list` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, typically requiring network access to the router. This could be achieved through a compromised device on the same network, or potentially remotely if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet.
- The attacker would also need a basic understanding of HTTP requests, string manipulation, and potentially some reverse engineering to craft the oversized string that will cause the stack overflow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is specified as `US_AC8V4.0si_V16.03.34.06_cn`.
- The provided text includes images that visually represent the vulnerable code and flow which is very helpful to fully understand the exploit.

This information provides a clear picture of the stack overflow vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and what the impact of exploitation is.
