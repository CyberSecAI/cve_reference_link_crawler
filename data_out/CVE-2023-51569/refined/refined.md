{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of BMP files, which can lead to a write past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a malformed BMP file. User interaction is required, either by visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted BMP file. The user must open this file using the vulnerable software or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability."
