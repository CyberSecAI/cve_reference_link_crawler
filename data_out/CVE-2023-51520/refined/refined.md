- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress versions before 9.7.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This indicates a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before outputting it on a webpage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, categorized under OWASP Top 10 as A3: Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. These injected scripts will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the website via the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized by the plugin. The required privilege is listed as "Contributor", which suggests that users with low-level access to the WordPress backend may be able to trigger the vulnerability, but it could also be triggered from the front end if a vulnerability exists there.
