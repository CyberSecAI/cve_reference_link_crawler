Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed by the commit:

**1. XSS Vulnerability in Admin Panel:**

*   **Root Cause:** The commit message mentions "Fixed xss in admin panel". The code changes indicate sanitization of user-provided data when rendering HTML, specifically in `system/controllers/admin/actions/widgets.php` and `templates/modern/controllers/admin/widgets_scheme.tpl.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unescaped or improperly sanitized user input being rendered in HTML contexts.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the admin panel, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities when an administrator views the crafted content.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating data that is later displayed in the admin panel, such as widget configurations, form fields or other stored content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to influence data stored in the system, typically by having administrative or content creation privileges or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject data.

**2. SSRF Vulnerability in Upload by Link:**

*   **Root Cause:** The commit message indicates "complete fix SSRF in upload by link". The changes in `system/core/uploader.php` focus on restricting the allowed URLs for upload by link. The fix includes preventing upload from local IPs and resolving hostnames and validating against reserved IP ranges.
*  **Weaknesses**: The system was vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it would fetch files from any given URL without proper validation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially make the server perform requests to internal services, leading to information disclosure, access to internal resources, and other internal attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Providing a malicious URL to the "upload from link" functionality of the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to utilize the upload functionality via a link, and an understanding of internal network configurations to target specific resources.

**3. Stored HTML Injection (Mitigated):**
   *   **Root Cause:** The commit message indicates "store via html filter". The changes in multiple form files and the `system/fields/html.php` file indicates that the system was not properly filtering HTML content entered into form fields. The vulnerability is mitigated using a html filter.
   *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper filtering when storing HTML content which could be then rendered to other users.
   *   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML that is later rendered to other users, which could have lead to XSS or content manipulation.
   *   **Attack Vector:**  Submitting malicious HTML code via editable fields like description on forms.
   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to submit and modify content via forms.

**Summary of Changes:**

*   **HTML Sanitization:** The commit implements sanitization using `html()` function on some fields that can potentially store unsafe HTML in `system/controllers/admin/actions/widgets.php` and `templates/modern/controllers/admin/widgets_scheme.tpl.php`.
*   **SSRF Protection:** The `system/core/uploader.php` file includes significant changes to how URLs are handled for uploads. It now resolves hostnames, validates IPs against private and reserved ranges, and checks for redirects.
*   **HTML Filtering:** The `system/fields/html.php` file is updated to enable a configurable html filter when storing the value. This functionality is then enabled in several form files to make sure descriptions are properly stored.
*   **Minor fixes:** Some minor fixes in other files, including correcting the file upload preview functionality, updating jQuery, and updating the Toastr library version.

In conclusion, this commit addresses critical security vulnerabilities, including XSS, SSRF, and HTML injection, making the system significantly more secure.
