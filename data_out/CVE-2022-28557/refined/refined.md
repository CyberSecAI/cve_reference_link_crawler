Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack overflow vulnerability in the `/goform/setpptpservercfg` interface.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `sanf` function is used to copy the `startip` and `endip` POST data to the stack without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Sending a crafted POST request with overly long `startip` and `endip` values can cause a crash of the web service running on the Tenda AC15 device.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to the vulnerable `/goform/setpptpservercfg` endpoint with oversized parameters `startip` and `endip`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web interface of the Tenda AC15 device.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability in the `/goform/setsambacfg` interface.
*  **Weaknesses**: The web interface does not properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject system commands through the POST data.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the Tenda AC15 device. The vulnerability can be combined with CVE-2021-44971 to achieve unconditional arbitrary command execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/setsambacfg` containing injected commands.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web interface of the Tenda AC15 device.

**Additional Notes**

*   The document mentions that both vulnerabilities can be used in conjunction with CVE-2021-44971 to achieve unconditional command execution, indicating that the device may be vulnerable to authentication bypass.
*   The provided images within the document are visual aids demonstrating the vulnerability and the crafted requests.
