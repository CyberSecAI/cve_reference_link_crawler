## Description:

FUEL-CMS-1.5.2 exists a reflected Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) vulnerability
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) in Navigation. On the Navigation page, it has been identified that attackers are capable of executing XSS injections using some payloads.

## Proof of Concept:

1. After logging in, searching on the Navigation page.

2. A payload can be inserted after the “group\_id” parameter, for example: payload -> "onmouseover="alert('xss')".
3. When the attacker moves the mouse over the Create button, it triggers an XSS attack.
