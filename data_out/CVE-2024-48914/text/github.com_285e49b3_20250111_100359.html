# Local file read vulnerability with AssetServerPlugin & LocalAssetStorageStrategy

Critical

[michaelbromley](/michaelbromley)
published
GHSA-r9mq-3c9r-fmjq
Oct 15, 2024

## Package

npm

@vendure/asset-server-plugin
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<3.0.5, <2.3.3

## Patched versions

3.0.5, 2.3.3

## Description

# Description

## Path traversal

This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a request which is able to traverse the server file system and retrieve the contents of arbitrary files, including sensitive data such as configuration files, environment variables, and other critical data stored on the server.

From Rajesh Sharma who discovered the vulnerability:

POC: `curl --path-as-is http://localhost:3000/assets/../package.json` gives you the content of package.json present in the local directory.

The vulnerability stems from usage of decodedReqPath directly in path.join without performing any path normalization i.e path.normalize in node.js

[vendure/packages/asset-server-plugin/src/plugin.ts](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/blob/801980e8f599c28c5059657a9d85dd03e3827992/packages/asset-server-plugin/src/plugin.ts#L352-L358)

Lines 352 to 358
in
[801980e](/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/commit/801980e8f599c28c5059657a9d85dd03e3827992)

|  | const decodedReqPath = decodeURIComponent(req.path); |
| --- | --- |
|  | if (imageParamsString !== '') { |
|  | const imageParamHash = this.md5(imageParamsString); |
|  | return path.join(this.cacheDir, this.addSuffix(decodedReqPath, imageParamHash, imageFormat)); |
|  | } else { |
|  | return decodedReqPath; |
|  | } |

If the vendure service is behind some server like nginx, apache, etc. Path normalization is performed on the root server level but still the actual client's request path will be sent to vendure service but not the resultant normalized path. However, depending the type of root server one can try various payloads to bypass such normalization.

I have found a customer website which uses local asset plugin and using above mentioned vulnerability, I was able to find secrets like email credentials.

## DOS via malformed URI

In the same code path is an additional vector for crashing the server via a malformed URI

Again from Rajesh:

There is also a potential Denial of Service (DoS) issue when incorrectly encoded URI characters are passed as part of the asset URL. When these malformed requests are processed, they can lead to system crashes or resource exhaustion, rendering the service unavailable to users.

Exploit: `curl --path-as-is http://localhost:3000/assets/%80package.json` , here `%80` is not a valid url-encoded character hence the decodeURIComponent is called on it, the entire app crashes.

```
[:server] /Users/abc/mywork/vendure/packages/asset-server-plugin/src/plugin.ts:353
[:server]         const decodedReqPath = decodeURIComponent(req.path);
[:server]                                ^
[:server] URIError: URI malformed

```
### Patches

v3.0.5, v2.3.3

### Workarounds

* Use object storage rather than the local file system, e.g. MinIO or S3
* Define middleware which detects and blocks requests with urls containing `/../`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
