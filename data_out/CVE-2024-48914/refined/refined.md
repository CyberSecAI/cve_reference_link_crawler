Based on the provided information, this content is related to **CVE-2024-48914**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `decodeURIComponent(req.path)` directly in `path.join` without any path normalization. This allows path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided paths, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malformed URI characters in the asset URL can crash the server due to an error in `decodeURIComponent`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Path Traversal:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive data like configuration files and credentials.
2.  **DoS:** Malformed requests can crash the server, making the service unavailable to users.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Path Traversal:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a URL containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the asset path. For example: `http://localhost:3000/assets/../package.json`
2. **DoS:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malformed URI (e.g., `%80`) in the asset path. For example: `http://localhost:3000/assets/%80package.json`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required. The attacker can be on the network (remote).
