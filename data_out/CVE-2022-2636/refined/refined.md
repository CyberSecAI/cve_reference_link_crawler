Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-2636:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `v-add-web-domain-redirect` script within the Hestia Control Panel. Specifically, the script's URL validation was insufficient, leading to the possibility of bypassing the intended redirect functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insufficient URL validation:** The script used a regular expression and a PHP `filter_var` function to validate URLs. However, the validation could be bypassed if the provided redirect target didn't include a scheme (`http://` or `https://`) . The script would then prepend `http://` before validation. This flaw made it possible to inject arbitrary strings, since it didn't properly sanitize the input before validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Redirect bypass:** Attackers could potentially bypass the intended redirect and cause users to be redirected to a malicious URL. This could lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
- **Arbitrary string injection:** Due to the lack of proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary string as redirect URL and potentially perform Cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker would need to use the `v-add-web-domain-redirect` script.
- The attacker would supply a crafted redirect target URL to bypass the validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker would need to have the ability to execute the `v-add-web-domain-redirect` script.  This likely means the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with privileges to manage web domain redirects within HestiaCP.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided commit fixes this vulnerability by improving the URL validation within the `v-add-web-domain-redirect` script.
- The commit message mentions "Fix security issues in v-add-web-domain-redirect" and the changelog entry explicitly refers to "Fixed an vulnerability in v-add-web-domain-redirect (CVE-2022-2636)".
- The code diff shows that the regular expression for URL validation has been improved and an additional check using `filter_var` has been introduced to improve validation.
