Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The application generates error messages that expose sensitive information. Specifically, the `roll_cms/roll_cms/views.py` file includes `except` blocks that catch exceptions (e.g., `TemplateDoesNotExist`, `TbRoll.DoesNotExist`, `UndefinedError`) and return HTTP responses containing the exception object (`e`). This object often includes details about the internal state of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information through error messages. This includes details about:
    *   Missing template names and locations.
    *   Missing database records (e.g., `roll_id`, `item_id`).
    *   Internal application errors that include exception details.
*   **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** The application does not sanitize or redact exception messages before returning them in HTTP responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge about the application's internal structure, file paths, database schemas and potentially the existence of certain database entries. This information can be used in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector Identification:** Detailed error messages can help an attacker identify attack vectors by revealing the structure of the application. For example, the error message may help craft more specific SQL injection attempts or path traversal attacks.
*   **Potential Credential Exposure:** Although not explicitly stated, the potential exists for error messages to expose database credentials or other sensitive information if these are used in queries or handled improperly within exception objects.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Triggering Errors:** By manipulating requests or data, an attacker can trigger specific exceptions in `roll_cms/roll_cms/views.py`, which leads to the generation of detailed error messages.
*   **Input Manipulation:** Errors can be triggered by requesting non-existent templates or database records or by crafting malformed requests that cause errors during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to interact with the application's interface to send HTTP requests that can trigger exceptions.
*   No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability report highlights multiple code snippets within `views.py` where exceptions are caught and their details are returned in error messages. This means multiple endpoints in the application are vulnerable.
*   The error messages, at the very least, disclose file paths and database record ids, which could help an attacker prepare a more targeted attack.
*   The code snippets provided in the issue contain a mix of English and Russian characters.
* The issue also mentions "self-generated" vs "externally generated" errors, but the report focuses on the "self-generated" category, where the application itself constructs and returns the error messages.
