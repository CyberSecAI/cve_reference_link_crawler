…ers and ensure user edit applies the restricted_to_site_admin option

This vulnerability with a default MISP installation without additional roles is disclosing list of role name which were restricted to the site admin. This commit fixes this disclosure vulnerability.

In addition for MISP installation with custom roles, an org admin user could create a user assigned to new custom roles which were restricted to site admin. This could lead to the access of complementary permissions (except site admin, org admin and sync actions).
