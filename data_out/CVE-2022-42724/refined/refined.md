Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the disclosure of role names restricted to site administrators to non-site admin users. Additionally, in installations with custom roles, an organization administrator could create a user and assign them roles that were intended to be restricted to site admins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Role names that should have been restricted to site administrators were being disclosed to non-site admin users.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Org admin users could potentially assign users to roles with higher privileges than intended. This does not include full site admin, org admin, and sync actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of role names restricted to site admins, potentially providing insights into the system's permission structure.
- An organization admin could potentially assign a user to roles that provided access to complementary permissions, although not to site admin, org admin, and sync actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Accessing the user management interface of the application as an organization administrator.
- Exploiting the user creation/editing functionality in the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in as a non-site administrator user, or an organization admin user in a MISP installation with custom roles.

**Additional details:**
- The commit includes code changes to prevent the disclosure of restricted role names to non-site admins when adding a user. Specifically, it adds the `restricted_to_site_admin` condition to the role filtering in the `admin_add` function.
- The commit also modifies the `admin_edit` function to verify and prevent an organization admin user from assigning a user to a role that is restricted to site admins.
- The fix ensures that non-site administrator users are not presented with roles meant for site administrators and prevents org admins from assigning site-admin-only roles to non-site admin users.
