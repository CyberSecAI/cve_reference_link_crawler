## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EventON < 2.2.15 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via event subtitle

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a new event at: https://example.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?post\_type=ajde\_events
2. In the event subtitle, put a malicious payload: `<script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Save
4. View the XSS at https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=ajde\_events
