# Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') in swift-nio

Moderate

[Lukasa](/Lukasa)
published
GHSA-7fj7-39wj-c64f
Sep 27, 2022

## Package

swift

swift-nio
([Swift](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aswift))

## Affected versions

<2.41.2

## Patched versions

2.42.0, 2.39.1, 2.29.1

## Description

`NIOHTTP1` and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and "inject" those newlines into the returned HTTP response.

This capability allows users to work around security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests, which can lead to XSS, cache poisoning, and a number of other flaws.

This issue was resolved by adding a default channel handler that polices outbound headers. This channel handler is added by default to channel pipelines, but can be removed by users if they are doing this validation themselves.

This issue was reported by Alessio Della Libera of Snyk Research Team (<https://github.com/dellalibera>, <https://twitter.com/_d3lla_>).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
