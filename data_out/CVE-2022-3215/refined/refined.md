- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers. The `NIOHTTP1` library and projects using it for generating HTTP responses are vulnerable when user-provided input from an incoming request is reflected into an HTTP response header. A malicious user can inject newlines into the reflected header (usually in encoded form).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113). Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data when constructing HTTP headers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack allows users to inject malicious HTTP headers, bypassing security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing. This can lead to:
    - Injecting entirely false responses.
    - False responses being treated as responses to subsequent requests.
    - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
    - Cache poisoning.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker sends a crafted request with specially encoded newline characters in a parameter that will be reflected into an HTTP response header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a request to a server that reflects parts of that request into an HTTP response header without proper sanitization. No special privileges or user interaction are needed. The attacker needs to be on the network, but does not need to be on the same physical network.
