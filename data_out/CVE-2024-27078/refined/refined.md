{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `tpg_alloc` function in the v4l2-tpg driver did not properly deallocate resources in all error-handling paths. The function allocates memory in loops, and if allocation fails mid-loop, only resources allocated before the failure are freed, causing memory leaks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to missing resource deallocation in error paths."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leaks leading to potential denial-of-service by exhausting available memory resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "Triggering the `tpg_alloc` function with a configuration that leads to memory allocation failures.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to interact with the v4l2-tpg driver, possibly through a video device, in a way that would lead to a memory allocation failure within the `tpg_alloc` function."
  },
  "resolution": "The fix adds proper resource deallocation (vfree) in all error-handling paths within the tpg_alloc function.",
    "cve": "CVE-2024-27078"
