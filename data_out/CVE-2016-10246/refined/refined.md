Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-10246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A global buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `main` function of the `jstest_main.c` file in mupdf. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function attempts to copy data into a fixed-size buffer (`filename`). When the input data exceeds the buffer's capacity, a buffer overflow occurs, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **strcpy Vulnerability:** The usage of `strcpy` is a known security risk because it does not check the size of the source string before copying, potentially overflowing the destination buffer.
- **strcpy-param-overlap:** The initial bug report notes a `strcpy-param-overlap`, which means that the source and destination buffers may overlap, which is undefined behavior in C, and can lead to unexpected results and corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory, which can lead to a crash of the `mujstest` application. The vulnerability is classified as a Denial of Service in the advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted input file to the `mujstest` program.
- **Remote Attackers**: While the specific vector of delivery is not stated, the debian advisory mentions "remote attackers", suggesting this could be remotely triggered via a network facing application using mupdf.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted file as input to the `mujstest` utility. This could involve tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file with mupdf.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerability exists, and how to craft a file to trigger it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered via fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The vulnerable code resides in the `mujstest` utility which is used for testing javascript in mupdf.
- The bug was reported to upstream on 2016-08-05
- The fix was released on 2016-09-22 and backported to older versions.
- The `filename` buffer in `jstest_main.c` is 1024 bytes large.
- The stack trace from ASan indicates that the overflow is happening in the `strcpy` function call in `main` at line 353 of `jstest_main.c`.
