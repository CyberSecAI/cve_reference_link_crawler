Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `Svg` tag in the Statamic CMS does not sanitize SVG content by default when retrieving an SVG file using `File::get()`. This lack of sanitization allows for the inclusion of malicious code within SVG files, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper sanitization of SVG content. The `Svg` tag retrieves and outputs SVG files without stripping potentially harmful code embedded within them.
*   **Bypassing existing file extension block:** The file upload functionality only blocks certain file extensions (php, php3, php4, php5, phtml), but allows for the upload of SVG files, which can contain executable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within an SVG file. When this SVG is displayed on a website using the vulnerable `Svg` tag, the injected script executes in the user's browser.
*   **Cookie Theft:**  As demonstrated in the provided PoC code, an attacker could potentially steal user cookies by executing malicious JavaScript within the SVG, using `document.cookie`.
*   **Arbitrary Actions:**  The attacker could potentially perform other actions on behalf of the user, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or even defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SVG Upload:** An attacker uploads a crafted SVG file disguised as a social media icon or other image to the website.
*   **File Inclusion:** The application uses the `Svg` tag to display the uploaded SVG. Since the `Svg` tag renders the file content directly without proper sanitization, it executes the attacker's malicious payload.
*   **XSS Trigger:** When a user visits a page where the malicious SVG is displayed, the embedded malicious JavaScript executes in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the Statamic CMS. This typically requires some level of authenticated access, such as a CMS user role with permissions to manage assets.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker would need to be aware that the application uses the `Svg` tag to render SVG files and that it is vulnerable to XSS through SVG content.
*   **Able to create malicious SVG:** The attacker must have the ability to craft SVG files containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a `sanitize` parameter to the `svg` tag and utilizing a sanitization library.
*   The fix includes the ability to specify additional allowed attributes and tags for sanitization, providing flexibility.
*   The fix was initially implemented using the `darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer` package but was later swapped for another sanitization package.
*   The vulnerability was rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 5.5.

**Code Snippets related to the vulnerability:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:**  `cms/src/Tags/Svg.php` before the fix, shows the usage of `File::get($file)` without sanitization.
*   **Fixed Code:**  `cms/src/Tags/Svg.php` after the fix, shows the introduction of a `sanitize` parameter and the use of the `enshrined/svgSanitize` library.
