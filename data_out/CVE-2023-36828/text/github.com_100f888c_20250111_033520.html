# Antlers sanitizer cannot effectively sanitize malicious SVG

Moderate

[jasonvarga](/jasonvarga)
published
GHSA-6r5g-cq4q-327g
Jul 5, 2023

## Package

composer

cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<= 4.9.2

## Patched versions

4.10.0

## Description

Antlers sanitizer cannot effectively sanitize malicious SVG

### Summary

The SVG tag does not sanitize malicious SVG. Therefore, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform XSS attacks using SVG, even when using the `sanitize` function.

### Details

Regarding the previous discussion mentioned [here](https://github.com/statamic/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-jvw9-rrc5-39g6#advisory-comment-84322), it has been identified that the default blacklist in the **FilesFieldtypeController** (located at this [link](https://github.com/statamic/cms/blob/f806b6b007ddcf066082eef175653c5beaa96d60/src/Http/Controllers/CP/Fieldtypes/FilesFieldtypeController.php#L15)) only blocks certain file extensions such as php, php3, php4, php5, and phtml. This allows a malicious user to upload a manipulated SVG file disguised as a social media icon, potentially triggering an XSS vulnerability.

### PoC Screenshot

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494868/251093022-15f949e9-2014-4069-850b-81940076745e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494868/251093022-15f949e9-2014-4069-850b-81940076745e.png)

### PoC

1. Create new Global set, let's say "Settings"
2. Create a "Grid" field in Blueprint (named: social), then add somefields Name (text), URL (text) and Icon (Assets) in the section Fields.
3. When calling the social setting in the `_footer.antlers.html`, remember to [sanitize](https://statamic.dev/modifiers/sanitize)

```
{{ settings:social }}
    <a href="{{ $url }}" class="ml-4" aria-label="{{ $name }}" rel="noopener">
        {{ svg :src="icon" class="h-6 w-6 hover:text-hot-pink" | sanitize }}
    </a>
{{ /settings:social }}

```

4. Upload the malicious SVG image, here is the code:

```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">

<svg width="500" height="500" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <text x="20" y="35">Statamic</text>
   <foreignObject width="500" height="500">
            <iframe xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" src="javascript:confirm(document.cookie);" width="400" height="250"/>
   </foreignObject>
</svg>

```
### Impact

Since the social media icon is displayed in the footer layout, any user can view it, potentially leading to the execution of XSS.

### Suggestions to Mitigate or Resolve the Issue:

Sanitize when outputing the svg. This vulnerability caused by unsanitized `File::get()` when retrieving the SVG, it is crucial to sanitize the SVG when outputting it. The issue can be found in the following file:

[cms/src/Tags/Svg.php](https://github.com/statamic/cms/blob/f806b6b007ddcf066082eef175653c5beaa96d60/src/Tags/Svg.php#L36-L40)

Lines 36 to 40
in
[f806b6b](/statamic/cms/commit/f806b6b007ddcf066082eef175653c5beaa96d60)

|  | if (File::exists($file)) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | $svg = StaticStringy::collapseWhitespace( |
|  | File::get($file) |
|  | ); |
|  | break; |

.

It is highly recommended to implement proper sanitization measures to ensure the security of the SVG content. One effective approach is to utilize a reliable package, such as <https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer> ,which provides comprehensive SVG sanitization capabilities.

So the code becomes:

```
use enshrined\svgSanitize\Sanitizer;

if (File::exists($file)) {

    $sanitizer = new Sanitizer();
    $dirtySVG = File::get($file);

    $svg = $sanitizer->sanitize($dirtySVG);
    break;
}
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
