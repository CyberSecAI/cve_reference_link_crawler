This PR adds a `sanitize` param to the `svg` tag battle potential XSS issues.

~~It uses <https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer> which is a PHP implementation of the popular DOMPurify library. <https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify>~~

**Note: This package was swapped out in [#8428](https://github.com/statamic/cms/pull/8428).**

The svg tag will now let you add `sanitize="true"` and will trigger the sanitization.

```
{{ svg src="..." sanitize="true" }}
```

```
<svg><path onclick="foo">...</path><script>alert('foo')</script></svg>
```

```
<svg><path>....</path></svg>
```

You may specify additional attributes or tags to be allowed through the sanitizer:

```
{{ svg src="..." sanitize="true" allow_attrs="onclick|onload" allow_tags="mesh|foreignObject" }}
```

We are leaving it as opt-in otherwise it would be a breaking change. In Statamic 5 we will make it sanitize by default.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@jasonvarga](https://github.com/jasonvarga) Will this also strip`<?xml ?>` nodes from SVGs?  While not a problem in normal usage, I've noted when using the SSG (specifically the `ssg:serve` command), any XML tags will attempt to be parsed by PHP |

| Will this also strip `<?xml ?>` nodes from SVGs?  No. If you have an xml tag in there, it'll stay. |
